They’re here to celebrate my forty years in journalism. There’s the gang from <em>Domino</em> fashion magazine, where I got my start in the can’t-spend-enough, cocaine-stoked ’80s. The <em>Globe and Mail</em> crew, from the ambitious middle of my career, hang out with colleagues from <em>Maclean’s</em>, the <em>Toronto Star</em>, and <em>Metro</em>. (I moved around a lot.) The CBC News crowd are huddled to my left, protecting themselves and their fat budgets from the circling sharks of underfunded journalism. My final job was with them: we were together for the <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> shutdown, the murder of George Floyd, the storming of the Capitol in Washington, DC, the invasion of Ukraine, nuclear threats from Russia, and blazing forests and atmospheric rivers at home. It was the most punishing news cycle of my career. I wasn’t sad to be leaving.</p>
<p>Just beyond the guests and beyond the hornbeam trees where I’ve strung fairy lights for the party, I think I can see my future. The grind of work is finally over, my retirement dream cued up. April in Paris! Reading by the sea! Spanish lessons in Antigua so I can better speak to my grandson. I’ll be playing with him, too, in the open-ended days my children rarely knew with me. I’m not saying I deserve a life of ease. But I worked hard to earn my retirement, dropping giant chunks of my salary into company and government pension plans throughout those forty years. It’s time for the famous social contract to hold up its end of the bargain and take care of me, the way it did my father before me, to deliver on the idea that retirement is my right after a life of work and the promise that I will have the time and means to enjoy it. </p>

<p>Except none of that happened. The year since my retirement party has not been a dreamy passage to a welcoming future but a nerve-shattering trip into the unknown. My debt is swelling like a broken ankle; my hard-won savings may or may not be sucked into the vortex of an international market collapse. Can I keep my house? Who knows? The macroeconomy is messing with my microeconomy. The future keeps shape-shifting. And none of the careful planning I put into my retirement is going to change that. </p>
<p>When I left my last job, I felt sad for friends determined to keep working to seventy and beyond. How eccentric they seemed. Now I repeat the same two words whenever I see them: “Don’t retire.”</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="dropcap">R</span><span class="smallcaps">oughly a thousand people</span> are retiring each day in Canada, Fraser Stark, president of the Longevity Pension Fund at Purpose Investments in Toronto, told me. That’s about a million currently retired. Ours is the largest generation in Canadian history to move into retirement, and we tend to get distracted by the sheer number of us snailing through the system like a row of snowplows on a four-lane highway. But the bigger issue with retiring at sixty-four, which is the average age Canadians leave the workforce, can be summed up in one increasingly terrifying word: longevity. </p>
<p>Anyone retiring in Canada right now can expect to live at least until eighty (women until eighty-four). But those numbers are averaged out. When I began to discuss retirement with my financial planner in early 2022, he put my life expectancy at ninety-four. “Why, thank you,” I said, “I do try to keep fit.” “No,” said Benjamin Klein, senior portfolio manager at Baskin Wealth Management, “life expectancy is not randomized. When we factor in your gender, genetics, access to good health care, education, and lifestyle, that’s how long you’ll live.”</p>
<p>Stark doubled down on that number. The oldest Canadian is believed to have died at age 117. “If you want to accurately plan, that’s the number that you need to write down,” he said. Retire at sixty-four and you could have fifty more years to save for. </p>
<p>Every generation lives longer than the one that came before&mdash;nothing new there. But a fifty-year span between the end of work and the end of life is a long way from the original purpose of paid retirement, which was a very short bridge of financial support. Or no bridge at all. Otto von Bismarck has been trotted out and smacked down many times for his invention of paid retirement: in 1881, he proposed that all Germans had the right to government support after a life of work, with payments kicking in at age seventy. Except that life expectancy in the 1880s was about forty years. When Canada created its own pension plan, in 1965, to address the growing poverty of retired Canadians sixty-five and older&mdash;thank you, Lester B. Pearson, for my monthly CPP cheque&mdash;the life expectancy of men, who made up the bulk of the workforce, was sixty-eight.</p>
<p>By 2019, 37 percent of Canadians fifty-five and older were concerned they wouldn’t have enough savings when they retired, <a href="http://- Canada.ca https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/programs/research/canadian-financial-capability-survey-2019.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to</a> the Canadian Financial Capability Survey. And that was before the rush of retirements during COVID, a third of them earlier than planned. Lockdown’s low interest rates and curtailed spending gave false hope to retirees such as me&mdash;those unspending days when the money in my bank account seemed to self-spawn like guppies. And, also like guppies, its lifespan was short lived. </p>
<p>“There’s not enough gold in my golden years,” I told Klein a few months into my retirement. I could feel him smiling sympathetically across the phone line. “You’re not alone,” he assured me. Rents, mortgages, groceries&mdash;Canadians are suffering. I described the little house graphic on my gas bill: the house keeps getting smaller, thanks to my ferocious vigilance. But the bill keeps getting bigger, thanks to the cost of gas. And that’s just standard housekeeping. Throw in the unexpected, like a family wedding or grown kids moving back home, and many retired people land “somewhere on the spectrum of panic,” Klein said.</p>
<p class="pull-quote">The oldest Canadian is believed to have died at age 117. Retire at sixty-four and you could have fifty more years to save for.</p>
<p>According to BMO’s thirteenth <a href="https://newsroom.bmo.com/2023-02-07-BMO-Annual-Retirement-Study-Canadians-Believe-They-Need-1-7M-to-Retire-Up-20-Per-Cent-from-2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Annual Retirement Study</a> released this past February, Canadians believe they need $1.7 million to retire, up 20 percent from 2020, when they put it at $1.4 million. The number is not statistically supported, but it’s a good gauge of people’s emotional preparedness for retirement and how anxious they feel. That third of Canadians who were worried, in 2019, that they wouldn’t have enough money has jumped to more than half of us in 2023, and 74 percent are concerned about inflation and rising prices. </p>
<p>Fewer than a quarter of retiring Canadians have a defined benefit pension plan, Stark said. Instead, “many of us retire with a lump sum of money.” The amounts vary, but the massive uncertainty of how long the money will last doesn’t. “We don’t know how long we’re going to live; we don’t know what the interest rates will be; we don’t know what the stock markets will do; we don’t know what inflation rates are,” said Stark. “Every one of us when we retire is on a unique journey of insecurity.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t&#8217;s not only</span> the retired who need to worry about supporting themselves in the long stretch of their future. Working generations coming up behind them will also shoulder this burden. A metric called the dependency ratio calculates the proportion of the people not in the workforce who are “dependent” on those of working age. According to Statistics Canada, dependents are aged zero to nineteen and sixty-five and over. Productives are twenty to sixty-four. The international tool is often cited by government and business and has been a driver of pension-reform debates around the world.</p>
<p>A low dependency ratio&mdash;in Mexico, for example&mdash;means that there are enough people working to support the dependent population. A high ratio&mdash;Japan and South Korea are at the top&mdash;indicates more financial stress on workers. Across all OECD countries right now, there are about thirty people sixty-five and over for every 100 people of working age. In 1950, that ratio was fourteen to 100; by 2075, it is predicted to increase to fifty-five non-working adults for every 100 working. </p>
<p>In Canada, we’re at the lower end, with dependency expected to hit about thirty-five by 2025, according to <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/pensions-at-a-glance-2015/old-age-dependency-ratio_pension_glance-2015-23-en;jsessionid=u7Q5drCgbYElgirFEUbcU5kQQhgkBcz_MWWQ4vhE.ip-10-240-5-146" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2015 data</a> from the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. But by 2075, our dependency ratio is projected to be 49.9&mdash;one dependent for every two working-age Canadians. That’s a big burden for Xs, Ms, and Zs. “The shrinking percentage of young people means that in the future, the number of workers may be insufficient to finance the pensions of retirees,” according to StatCan. </p>
<p>The original meaning of the word “retire,” from the French “retirer,” is the act of retreating, falling back, withdrawing into seclusion. Except the retirees I spoke to for this story had go-go schedules that I was worn out just hearing about. Many had taken on dramatically different types of paid employment after leaving their careers; others had unleashed their inner rebels to become tireless advocates for social justice and climate change; still others were full-time caregivers. </p>
<p>“The government pays very little” for retired Canadians, said Thomas Klassen, professor at York University’s School of Public Policy and Administration. Of the experts I spoke to about retirement, he was the only one of traditional retirement age, so you could say he had a stake in the debate, but I found him reliably dispassionate. He pointed out that retirees in new jobs pay income tax, taxes on their retirement income and government subsidies, HST and GST, and they contribute to the economy by spending money. “And yet we keep hearing that boomers are hoarding all the money and that we will bankrupt younger people,” he said.</p>
<p>Samir Sinha called the dependency ratio outdated and misguided. The director of geriatrics at Sinai Health and University Health Network in Toronto and a passionate defender of the rights of older Canadians argued that such concepts hold us back. “They don’t recognize the new reality that at sixty-five you’re likely to have twenty years” of good and productive life ahead. </p>
<p>The retired are among the country’s biggest contributors to child care and volunteer work, Sinha said. “Think about the amount governments save for the unpaid care that mostly older people are providing. When we’ve priced out the unpaid caregiver, we’re valuing that in the billions and billions of dollars every year.”</p>
<p>Mieko Ise might be called a “silent retiree”: someone who quietly leaves the workforce to look after family members in need. For years, she juggled looking after her own and her husband’s parents while working full time for a Toronto nonprofit. “I started to have issues with being a caregiver and a full-time employee,” said Ise, now in her sixties. “I would take vacation days. I would book time off. My boss was not particularly sympathetic. I get it. I don’t believe employers should carry the load of your life burden.” When it became too overwhelming to have two jobs, Ise quit the one we count as work. </p>

<p>Sinha pointed me to a Japanese movie called <em>Plan 75</em>, directed by Chie Hayakawa and released in 2022. In a dystopian future, Japan&mdash;which in real life is the demographically oldest OECD country, with a projected dependency ratio of seventy-seven to 100 by 2075&mdash;offers $1,000 to the elderly to terminate their own lives and relieve society of the burden of supporting them. The movie, which I watched with my seventy-six-year-old sister (a lawyer who retired at seventy-two), opened with a violent murder off camera. We heard the blast of gunshot and saw a wheelchair toppled on its side. “Cheery beginning,” said Laura. (It turned out&mdash;spoiler&mdash;the real <em>Plan 75</em> was to sell the older generations’ ashes for profit to a recycling company. The message of the sweetly weird movie was it’s better not to kill our elders.)</p>
<p>The year before <em>Plan 75</em> came out, Yusuke Narita, an assistant professor of economics at Yale University, suggested mass suicide and disembowelment for Japan’s aged. “I feel like the only solution is pretty clear,” he said in a 2021 video. Narita later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/12/world/asia/japan-elderly-mass-suicide.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">softened his comment</a>s in response to questions from the <em>New York Times</em>, saying they were an “abstract metaphor” (disembowelment seems pretty visceral to me). But he did win a big audience: he now has more than 600,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<p>It’s true that the number of people over sixty-five is growing faster in countries across Asia than anywhere else in the world at the same time that the size of their younger generations shrinks. That means as many as half of Japan’s employers report shortages of full-time workers, according to <em>New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/07/world/asia/japan-workers-retirement.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reporting</a> from earlier this year on ageing in Asia. Workers in their seventies and even eighties are stepping up to fill the gap, taking lower-paying jobs as delivery drivers, office cleaners, and store clerks&mdash;jobs that the younger generations don’t want. A quarter of people sixty-five and over in Japan are currently working. </p>
<p>The number is the same in Canada and increasing: 24 percent of Canadians aged sixty-five to seventy still work in jobs that can be measured, up from 11 percent in 2000. But the dependency ratio reinforces the belief that those sixty-five and over are not working. Workers are not counted as workers because they’ve <em>aged out</em> of the way that we count them. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">“T</span><span class="smallcaps">he Greys”</span> is what the older generation working for <em>Succession</em>’s Waystar RoyCo were called. They were often shot bunched together like an endangered species. They put on compression socks before flying. They plotted for their golden parachutes. Or maybe “one last rodeo,” as Karl, Waystar’s CFO, suggested to Frank, former vice chairman, in the final minutes of the hit series. Cut to Tom, the brand new CEO: “Frank, dead. Karl, dead. I really don’t need those two old cunts on my shoulder.” </p>
<p>I thought it was funny as hell. Or I did before my conversation with Lisa Taylor, president of Challenge Factory and co-author of <em>The Talent Revolution: Longevity and the Future of Work</em>. Taylor described ageism as “the last socially acceptable form of prejudice.” She and her company have set 2030&mdash;the year the last of the boomers reach sixty-five&mdash;as the target for solving what she described as the far-reaching and urgent issue of this country’s age-biased workforce.</p>
<p>I was skeptical. Surely, there are more important workplace issues to solve, like equity and fairness for people of every race and gender. But after a couple of hours on the phone with Taylor, I came to believe that treating retirement as a default outcome of ageing is a workplace bias that will affect the life expectancy, financial dependency, and long-term care costs for a generation retiring earlier than it needs or wants to. Not to mention the impact on the economy. Taylor said if we want to take advantage of our full workforce&mdash;in 2022, Canada had <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410032501" rel="noopener" target="_blank">nearly a million job vacancies</a>&mdash;we need to get to a point where we “recognize and call out ageism with the same level of comfort as we do other prejudices in our workplaces.”</p>
<p class="pull-quote">Fewer than a quarter of retiring Canadians have a defined benefit pension plan. Instead, many of us retire with a lump sum of money.</p>
<p>Systemic ageism was meant to have been legislated out of the workplace in 2006, when the Ontario Human Rights Commission won the argument that Canadian workers don’t come with a best-before date stamped on their foreheads. (I was a manager at the <em>Globe and Mail</em> at the time, I was fifty-one, and there was a lot of backroom worry about carrying the Greys on our backs&mdash;and a lot of wisecracks about a superannuated newsroom.) But even though sixty-five hasn’t been the legal age for retirement for seventeen years, “we’re constantly looking for ways to push them out the door,” said Sinha&mdash;with retirement packages, buyouts, and pension contributions capped at sixty-five. </p>
<p>Taylor’s company did a workplace survey of the financial services industry in 2015, and it showed that as early as age forty-nine, workers were no longer sent for training or high-performance programs and future-focused career conversations had slowed down. By the time someone hit fifty-five, “the conversation about leaving had been going on for years, except no one was actually saying it.” </p>
<p>My own conversations with retired Canadians, particularly men in finance, bore this out. Raymond Betts worked most of his life in the frenetic world of institutional equity in New York, Boston, and Toronto. (Betts asked that his name be changed for this article.) When he turned fifty-three, the company hired a younger employee to do the same job as his, without discussing it with him. “My desk was originally thirty-six inches long; they kept moving me to a smaller desk until I ended up sitting at one that was twenty-four inches long.” Betts left that world at sixty, taking his skills and work ethic to his second career as a real estate agent. </p>
<p>Many people buy into the company storyline that their best years are behind them&mdash;the proverbial coasting into retirement. “People start to say, ‘Susan’s checked out. Susan retired a few years ago, she just hasn’t told us,’” said Taylor. “It’s attributed to age instead of the company’s mismanagement of talent.”</p>
<p>It’s not a big step from there to the accepted myths about older workers: they’re slower and less productive. They’re over the hill, so training them is a cost instead of an investment. Ditto spending any time performance-managing them. The stickiest myth is that the long-time employee is too expensive. “Get this senior person off the books and hire two younger people to replace them,” is how Sinha put it. I’ve been part of those conversations myself about retirement-age people; likely my bosses also had them about me. But seeing the older worker as a financial burden is a failure of math. </p>
<p>“Calculations of how much employees cost a company generally include salary and benefits packages,” said Taylor. However, their not having to learn on the job, be trained, or engage the resources of a mentor, let alone the asset of being used as a mentor for younger staff&mdash;all of this also saves costs. “I have the experience, the relationships, the contacts. I work incredibly hard,” said Betts. He still does: he’s sold 132 houses in the seven years since he turned sixty.</p>
<p>I mentioned to Taylor that some of the Greys at CBC News seemed to struggle with technology during COVID. She stopped me. “We give a pass to the twenty-three-year-old with cats walking back and forth on camera,” she said. But we snicker when someone over sixty leaves their mike off. I blamed imminent senility, especially when the person on mute was myself. </p>
<p class="pull-quote">Another problem with retirement: it could kill you. People who stop working too soon may not have much time to live before they die.</p>
<p>Taylor was unsurprised. “Ageism is also self-imposed,” she said. Her example was the joke birthday cards we send each other. “If you replaced age with any other characteristic, you would never send it,” she said. I don’t mention the card I just received for my sixty-eighth birthday, a New Yorker cartoon called “Senior Charades.” The old man’s word bubble says: “Two words&mdash;I forgot what they are.” It got a big laugh and led to various tips about how to behave at work to appear less old: Don’t groan when you stand up. Smile in meetings so your face doesn’t sag into resting-old-face. And never rummage for anything, especially glasses. (Actually, never say the word “rummage.”) </p>
<p>Taylor, who turned forty-nine this spring (and says she’s been losing her glasses since she was twenty-two), is a long way from retirement; so are most of the experts I spoke with. I found their dedication moving; they saw it as realistic. “Unlike other prejudices, 100 percent of people will feel age prejudice if we don’t solve it,” said Taylor. Klassen thinks it will take twenty years for the workplace to reflect the law. Sinha said we’re still in the “baby steps” of realizing that longevity has implications for how long we work. “The workplace has not caught up with the reality of life expectancy, and therefore of career expectancy,” he said. </p>
<p>Working longer because you’re likely to live longer is not everyone’s idea of how best to reform retirement. It’s an anathema in France, to give the most widely reported example. President Emmanuel Macron finally pushed through his pension reforms this past spring, increasing the retirement age from sixty-two to sixty-four over a seven-year period. In the often-violent street battles that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/france-protests-police-violence-5a2e01ed4fbcfeee6a3ac098db94339c" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fed headlines</a> everywhere, protesters lost a thumb, an eye, and even, to one officer’s club in Paris, a testicle. One of the many slogans from the protests stood out for me: “Leave us time to live before we die.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smallcaps">ut here&#8217;s</span> a more existential problem with retirement: it could kill you. People who stop working too soon may <em>not</em> have much time to live before they die. “You hear about the doctors whose entire life and identity was at the hospital,” said Sinha. Then they retire and “they’re dead a few months later.” Similar sudden-death stories circulate about a certain type of driven, lifelong journalist, and I always assumed they were apocryphal. Or that the victim had been ignoring long-standing health issues. </p>
<p>Shortened life expectancy can be predicted by a lack of purpose, Sinha said. He referred to a “meta-analysis” project from 2010 that combined research from 148 studies involving 308,849 people to show that social connection and purpose increased survival by 50 percent. A lack of social relationships created the same risk of death as well-established factors such as smoking, drinking, and obesity. It was a gobsmacking discovery thirteen years ago; a lot of subsequent research has since supported the finding that early retirement can mean less time to enjoy it.<br />
The Blue Zones research into the world’s longest-lived people, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/5-blue-zones-where-the-worlds-healthiest-people-live" rel="noopener" target="_blank">much publicized</a> by National Geographic and now a Netflix docuseries called <em>Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zone</em>, also links longevity with purpose. “In the island community of Okinawa”&mdash;in Japan, where very long-lived women thrive on a diet of sweet potatoes, mugwort, and goya&mdash;“everybody can tell you what their sense of purpose is,” said Sinha. “They have a word for it: ikigai, which means ‘reason for being.’”</p>
<p>Every society uses markers as shorthand for people to understand each other. “In some societies, it’s your last name or who your parents were,” said Taylor. “Americans use job titles, but they’re equally likely to identify each other by the city they grew up in, or what university they went to, or what sports team they’re a fan of.” In Canada, she said, “we almost exclusively use our job titles to define who we are.” Sometimes we go so far as to use our previous job to describe ourselves after we retire, in what Taylor calls a “backwards-looking identity.” Even when we’re not working, “we reinforce work as a critical piece of our own identity.” </p>
<p>John Davey worked at Dow Chemical in his hometown of Sarnia, Ontario, for thirty-two years. He left at age fifty-eight. “I didn’t retire. I <em>was retired</em>,” Davey, who’s now seventy-two, told me. It was part of a company-wide downscaling (he bears no grudges). It took less than a month for him to understand he was not the stay-at-home type. “One day, I sat in my living room and hoped it would snow so I could go out and shovel.” He’s worked ever since, most recently as a flower-delivery-person. “I know men who say they are going to regrout the bathroom or whatever, but that’s done and then what?” he said.</p>
<p>Don O’Connor put the perils of not having purpose more starkly. He was in wealth management and real estate at TD Bank, in Toronto, for thirty-six years, so his financial literacy was better than the average Canadian’s. COVID made him realize how much he hated the three-hour commute, and so he retired last year, at sixty-two. Now he works part time at a funeral home in Burlington and loves everything about it&mdash;two-minute drive, flexible hours, every day is different&mdash;and puts up with the mild astonishment of his friends about his new job, because, as he told me on our call, “if you don’t do anything, you’re on an express route to death.” </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smallcaps">ere&#8217;s a bleak</span> prospect for many retiring Canadians: they will leave or be pushed out of the workforce too soon and without enough money. They’re financially prepared for the short and medium haul of life after work, but not the long one. They will go on to live too long, in too poor health (increased life expectancy has also increased the number of years people spend being sick), with a dwindling ability to support themselves or live independently. Ultimately, they’ll become wards of the state, housed in long-term care at great cost to the government and society. Sinha said: “This is where our destitute end up, in these government-run facilities.” According to a 2019 report by the National Institute on Ageing at Toronto Metropolitan University, long-term care costs <a href="https://www.niageing.ca/commentary-posts/10/7/long-term-care-costs-in-canada-projected-to-triple-in-only-30-years" rel="noopener" target="_blank">are expected to</a> triple from $22 billion to $71 billion by 2050. “It will be the equivalent of the modern-day Victorian poor house for our old,” Sinha said.</p>
<p>“We know this for a fact: the human brain is not equipped to make long-term decisions,” said Bonnie-Jeanne MacDonald, director of financial security research at the <a href="https://www.niageing.ca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Institute on Ageing</a>. “The human brain is very optimistic, which is great, but it can’t process the bad things that will happen in the future.” Decisions made now are not just for yourself in five years but for you in thirty years. “And that’s going to be a much more vulnerable person than you are right now, health wise.” </p>
<p>The National Institute on Ageing report says that, by 2050, care in one’s own home will cost up to $25,000 a month; care in a retirement home or residence could be as much as $10,000 a month. Those options will be unaffordable for most Canadians. Meanwhile, the number of people caring for family members at home will decrease sharply. Between now and 2050, Canada is expected to have 30 percent fewer voluntary caregivers, according to Sinha. Paid health care workers will not fill the gap: Canada’s universal health care system “was never designed to cover the provision of long-term care services,” including home and community care nursing, Sinha said. Long-term care insurance (LTCI) is now mandatory in Germany, South Korea, and Japan. Here in Canada, home-based care doesn’t even cover prescription medications. According to that 2019 Canadian Financial Capability Survey, a third of Canadians also worry they won’t be able to afford health care costs as they age, and rightly so. </p>
<p>“We spend the majority of our life savings paying for care in the last ten years of our life,” said Klein, the financial manager who put my life expectancy at ninety-four, which is sounding less and less like good news. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">f we could</span> create a different kind of retirement in Canada, a more inclusive, more creative, and flexible concept of work&mdash;and one that erased the grim picture of poor houses for the old&mdash;where would we start? After talking to dozens of experts and retired Canadians, three ideas, or ideals, formed my personal retirement manifesto. </p>
<p>The first would be to make measures against ageism part of every company’s fair-employment practice. Imagine a legacy career path that sees Canadians move from a forty- to a sixty-year work life, without censure or ridicule for being too old to work. I think of what Taylor said: “People change jobs all the time, but as we get older, we think we must continue doing exactly what we’re doing now or fall off a cliff. These are extreme alternatives.” The more high powered the job, and the higher in pay scale, the more we believe there is nowhere for workers to go but out. But many older workers prefer to forgo the intensity of management responsibilities, higher salaries, and relentless climbing and return to the craft work they excelled at in the beginning of their careers&mdash;even for a lot less money. Go ahead and ask them. As my own career wound down, I often thought&mdash;but did not say&mdash;that I wanted to go back to writing and editing, to revive my love of words that had taken me all the way to senior news director at the CBC, where I wasn’t allowed anywhere near copy.  </p>
<p>The second tenet of my manifesto is phased retirement. This one took me a while to get to, even though every expert and most of the retirees I spoke to were for it. I asked fellow CBC leader Greg Reaume, sixty-eight, who retired from running world news at CBC News a few months before I left myself, what he’d have said if I’d asked him to stay on a couple of days a week for the next two years, or if we’d opened that option to everybody. “A minefield,” Reaume said. “And complicated to manage.” “Right?” I agreed. Which is exactly the problem. Even if bosses like us believe in and desire phased retirement, taking on the labour-intensive job of juggling the options (do you make it mandatory to offer, but voluntary to accept?) and coordinating the schedules of part-time staff would keep managers from getting on side. We need to get them on side, though, because think of the benefits: to the worker who wants to keep contributing, to the employer who keeps getting returns on their experience and work ethic, and to the Canadian economy in need of workers. Figure that out and we move toward retirement becoming an adaptive and gradual transition rather than an on/off switch. Indeed, Klassen’s research showed a strong preference among older workers to gradually ease out of full-time employment, working fewer days over a period of several years. His definition of retirement is “a transition from working mostly full time to not working mostly full time.” </p>
<p>Finally, I propose we find new words to describe both retirement and retirees. A line from a 2014 <em>Atlantic</em> story on American retirement <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/09/the-great-stock-myth/308178/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">puts the lie</a> to the core idea of traditional retirement. “I don’t know if it’s ever going to be realistic that everyone saves enough to spend the last third of their life on vacation,” New York economist and author Allison Schrager was quoted as saying. (When I called her recently to ask if she still stood by this idea, her answer was a firm <em>yes</em>.) That vision of retirement, the one my father enjoyed and the one I had teed up for myself? None of it makes any sense anymore. Media, banks, and self-help books have lately been bandying around the term “The New Retirement,” but we should really be talking about the end of retirement. Instead of talking about “The Retired,” we should be talking about “The <em>Un</em>retired.” Not the undead&mdash;not yet&mdash;but maybe as indomitable. </p>
<p>Except that’s not right either. If our goal is to have Canadians work for as long as they’re excited and willing and able and empowered to do so, how about if we just call them workers? Because the essential zeitgeist of the retiree in 2023 is to keep working, however that looks. </p>
<p>Raymond Betts, even as he moves from being “goal oriented to soul oriented,” told me he will “never retire. My father worked until he was ninety-seven and died four months later, at ninety-eight.” Betts wasn’t sure he’d see the point in going on without work. “Work gives me a reason to call someone,” he said. “I have a mission. I have a reason to talk to people.”</p>
<p>Mieko Ise believes retirement is a time to take risks in a way that younger people who need to keep their jobs can’t. “Speak out!” she said. “I want to be reinvigorated, not retired.” Vicki Obedkoff, who retired in Saskatoon at seventy-one, after forty years as a minister with the United Church of Canada, fights for the same causes she’s always supported: climate change, human rights, and social justice. She quoted Alice Walker: activism is my rent for living on the planet. “I think about her often,” said Obedkoff. “I can’t see a time in the future when I will let this work go.”</p>
<p>Marjorie Beaucage, a seventy-six-year-old artist and Elder who lives in Duck Lake, Saskatchewan, was baffled by the whole idea of retirement. “I don’t know any of those retired people,” she said. “Elders don’t retire. Neither do artists. For Elders, this time of life is the busiest. You have to be there for your community.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he way I think</span> about my own retirement has changed significantly since I started working on this article. I’m part of a generation that will live the longest in history and also work the longest, if the big thinkers&mdash;and the workers themselves&mdash;succeed in moving Canadians from a forty-year career path to a sixty-year one. It’s new terrain, and the best way through is to be alert, adaptable, open to failure, and ready to act fast on success. </p>
<p>I don’t see retiring when I did as a failure&mdash;I had my second career as a writer I wanted to focus on and that grandson I’m gaga to spend time with. But I wonder why I didn’t have the conversation about a staged departure into a different kind of role, or why no one else had it with me. </p>
<p>I’m newly alert to dinner-table banter that turns ageist. It is without exception driven by people my age. “It’s time for the old farts to make way for the next generation,” said one retired financial industry executive at a recent dinner party when the conversation turned to the <em>Globe and Mail</em>’s leadership. (Phillip Crawley, publisher, announced <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-globe-and-mail-ceo-phillip-crawley-to-retire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his retirement</a> a month later, at seventy-eight.) “Hold on,” I said and then held forth on what I’ve learned about age prejudice. It may have been obnoxious. I will probably keep doing it. (Speak out, inner rebel!) </p>
<p>For now, I’m following Benjamin Klein’s simple financial advice: more input, less output. “Those are the only two things we can control,” he said. Which could mean getting a job&mdash;and not in management or journalism but something completely different. I’ve been an admirer of people who dedicate their retirement to volunteer work but felt pity when I saw someone my own age shelving groceries or working as a greeter. Now I think, “Long life headed your way, my friend!” I’ve stopped “backwards identifying” myself by the work I used to do, after Lisa Taylor asked me to “please be bold and to introduce yourself as you are now.” In my case, that’s as a writer. Now and then I even try to picture my future self, thirty years from now, but Bonnie-Jeanne MacDonald is right. It’s unfathomable. I accept that older Cathrin will be more fragile. Hopefully not in the poor house but perhaps a modest room or two, with a few things to remind me of the people I love&mdash;and also with the people I love. Likely I won’t be working. We can but hope. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-end-of-retirement/">The End of Retirement</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

It’s why so many of the greatest names in sport often fade from the spotlight once they leave the field, to age out of sight. And it’s why, as the clock ticked down toward 8 a.m. on July 31, 2016, I stood at the start line of the Canadian Death Race, willing the oldest contestant to do what few believed possible.</p>
<p>For fifteen years, Dag Aabye had been coming to Grande Cache, Alberta, to push his body further and faster than many of his fellow competitors, the majority of them less than half his age. Many who started the race never finished, and those who did often took up to twenty-four hours to push and drag their bodies around the 125-kilometre mud-sloped inclines and exhausting switchbacks that make up the Death Race. Dag had completed it a record seven times, each time as its oldest competitor. But now, seven long years had passed since he last crossed the finish line. And though he was markedly slower at seventy-five than he had been at sixty-nine, he refused to give up. When he ran, he did so for sport, for pleasure, and for his own survival.</p>
<p>But there was something fleeting to it all. A general understanding that if he ever stopped running, he would stop existing altogether. As one of his fellow contestants noted, Dag seemed to have “an ephemeral, monk-like presence” on the trail. His slow yet relentless style appeared almost spiritual and evoked comparisons to the legendary Japanese monks of Mount Hiei who run-walk 1,000 marathons in 1,000 days in order to attain enlightenment. But he also evoked comparisons to a freak of nature: a veritable wolverine who, like the tortured mutant from the X-Men comic books, seemed to age slower than anyone else and had a capacity to withstand inhuman degrees of pain and keep pushing forward.</p>

</ul>
<p>At any given time, he looked the part both of a battle-hardened warrior and a sage, old mystic. It was the latter image that tended to endear him to most people. Especially when he slowed his pace, approaching a fellow runner who was keeled over in pain and on the brink of collapse. He would appear to them like some half-naked septuagenarian messiah, his figure distorted through their sweat-blurred vision as he planted his feet next to theirs, placed his hand on their shoulder, and imparted some ancient-sounding wisdom.</p>
<p>One racer would later recall Dag’s words like so: “Look down. It does not matter where your feet were yesterday or where they are going to be tomorrow. It matters where your feet are at this moment.”</p>
<p>Dag never liked to start a race from anywhere but the very back of the herd. It allowed him to slip into his own meditative rhythm. He stood back from the start line and breathed in the optimism of the first-time competitors while filtering out the sound of the beats pumping out of the loudspeakers nearby. He preferred to listen to the beat of his own heart when he ran. It was the inner metronome he kept pace to. Two beats to every step&mdash;three if he was going uphill. There was a synchronization between heart and mind when he really got moving, when he swore he could feel his pulse inside his brain. That’s when the endorphins would kick in, creating a runner’s high that he called his “gateway to clarity.” Once he passed through that gateway, he could hold his pace for several hours.</p>
<p>Dag knew his body couldn’t move like it used to, but he was determined to push it as hard as he could for as long as possible. It didn’t bother him that he was losing momentum. He knew that ultimately his days as a Death Racer would end, not because he couldn’t handle the race but because his body would slow to such a pace that he would fail to reach the first checkpoint before the cut-off time. The prospect that someday he would be told that he was essentially too old and too slow to even start the race didn’t bother him either. Because that day still seemed distant. </p>
<p>Soon a rush of the youngest, most competitive runners pushed over the start line. None knew what lay before them, that by nightfall some runners in a hypothermic state would be rescued while others would be treated for exhaustion. </p>
<p>Dag watched the first few hundred racers disappear into the forest, heading along a mud-soaked trail that would lead them 19 kilometres toward an abandoned rail line and onward to the base of an 1,800-metre mountain. The herd was thinning out, the race already several minutes old, when he finally pressed his finger to his stopwatch and began to move. He was all alone as he crossed the start line, an elderly man who had already fallen behind the pack. He was last, but he was just getting started.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t was curiosity and desire,</span> not ego, that drove Dag back to the Death Race again and again. Despite his advancing years, his best finish had not been his first but rather his third, when, at the age of sixty-four, he crossed the finish line after 20 hours and 56 minutes&mdash;1 minute and 54 seconds faster than he had run at the age of sixty-two. What he craved above all was the magical feeling he experienced most often on the trails near the school bus in which he lived on the side of a mountain in British Columbia, when he would reach a marker in the bush and check his stopwatch, only to surprise himself that he was running faster than he had in several years. He lived for those moments, rare as they were now, because it was then that he felt a connection to something preternatural. “It’s like touching the fountain of youth,” Dag had told me. “Juan Ponce de León went looking in the wrong place. He didn’t need to sail to Florida. All he needed was a stopwatch, a journal, and a pair of running shoes.”</p>
<p>There were inherent risks associated with running such a long distance, but no one went into the Death Race expecting to die. And yet, like any ultramarathon, the race had a way of making you feel as though you were pushing toward death. Much of that came from the reality that running such distances demanded much more than the expected wear on the joints, muscles, and ligaments. It disrupted multiple parts of the body’s internal function, the most common being the diversion of blood from the racers’ stomachs into their muscles, stopping their digestion and causing uncontrolled nausea. Sometimes a racer would double over with stomach pain or turn their head sideways and vomit over their shoulder while they ran. Some experienced a temporary loss of vision as their corneas swelled from a buildup of fluid. Then there were those who would end up so fatigued on the trail that they would begin to hallucinate. They were the ones who could prove a danger to themselves, seeing and hearing things along the trail that weren’t really there and, in the most problematic cases, wandering into the wilderness and getting lost. </p>
<p>Most elite runners reach their peak between age thirty and thirty-five. Then muscle mass, bone density, and maximal aerobic capacity begin to decrease. And though some runners do manage to run faster at fifty than they did at thirty-five, it is generally because they performed below their capacity when they were younger. Athletes running at their peak will experience a gradual trail-off from age thirty-five, and by fifty, they will have lost roughly 2 minutes and 45 seconds per year over the course of a 42.2-kilometre marathon. After age sixty, the performance declines become more drastic as the human stride shortens and ankle power decreases.</p>
<p>For all Dag knew, his capacity as an ultramarathon runner had probably peaked in the early 1970s, when he was in his early thirties. But he had only just begun running at that time and had confined himself to simple marathons while also living the life of a professional skier in winter and working as a full-time logger during the summers. He ran his first marathon in northern Washington in his early thirties&mdash;in a pair of jeans and without training. He finished in just under four hours, which put him in the range of intermediate runners in his age group. He competed in ten more marathons before he was fifty. In his late forties, his finishing times were hovering around 3 hours and 20 minutes. He was fast enough to qualify for the Boston Marathon, but he never bothered to enter. By his late fifties, he had also taken up competitive cross-country skiing, and by the time he turned sixty-one, he was a Canadian championship ski racer, placing fourth in his age group at the 2002 Masters World Cup cross-country ski race in Quebec despite never having had a coach. </p>
<p>Then someone slapped a promotional flier for the Death Race onto a table while he was eating and said, “Here’s something you’re probably too old to do.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smallcaps">ag was sixty-two</span> when he hitched a ride to Grande Cache and entered his first Death Race. He finished in a gruelling 20 hours, 58 minutes, and 16 seconds. The next year, he crossed the finish line in 23 hours and 48 seconds. Then he came back again twelve months later, at the age of sixty-four, and posted his personal best&mdash;20 hours and 56 minutes. He ran an average of 6 kilometres an hour during that year’s race, covering roughly 560 metres more each hour than he had the year before. He used that personal best as the benchmark to track his aging and his decline up until 2009, when he finished the race for the last time, in 23 hours, 5 minutes, and 26 seconds, his pace having dropped back to roughly the same as it was when he was five years younger. It was the last time he was able to complete the entire 125-kilometre circuit in the requisite twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>But he never stopped trying, and every subsequent year that he fell short of the 125-kilometre mark, he succeeded in finishing what race organizers called the Near Death Marathon, a 49-kilometre ultra that was itself 7.8 kilometres longer than a regulation marathon. The Near Death Marathon, which was essentially the first half of the Death Race, had its own designated cut-off time&mdash;9.5 hours&mdash;meant to safeguard both the competitive nature of the contest and the health of its contestants. In 2010, Dag had completed the Near Death Marathon with 45 minutes to spare and used that feat as the new barometer by which to challenge his body as he entered his seventies. In 2011, he actually got faster, shedding 28 minutes from his time the previous year.</p>
<p>Though Dag was always the oldest person on the trail, he was inspired by runners even older than him who continued to compete in more traditional marathons around the world. Among them was the Sikh road runner Fauja Singh, who in 2011, at the age of 100, became the first centenarian to complete an organized marathon when he finished the Toronto Waterfront Marathon. Dag had read about Singh in the <em>Globe and Mail</em>, cut out the article, and taped it into one of his journals for inspiration. Singh was born in British India in 1911 and was so malnourished as a boy that he did not walk until the age of five. He lived through Partition and the birth of modern India and was already beyond his life expectancy when, in the mid-1990s, he took up running as a means of therapy after the deaths of his wife, a son, and a daughter. He competed in his first organized marathon at eighty-nine and set his personal best aged ninety-two, when he completed the Flora London Marathon in 6 hours and 54 minutes.</p>
<p>Singh, who attributed his physical longevity to abstaining from smoking and alcohol and to a vegetarian diet, lived on the outskirts of London, England, trained primarily on asphalt, and subsisted on a simple diet of phulka, dal, green vegetables, yogurt, and milk. Compared to Dag, Singh treated his body like a temple. “I take lots of water and tea with ginger,” he told a reporter with the <em>Indian Express</em> in 2004. “I go to bed early taking the name of my Rabba [God] as I don’t want all those negative thoughts crossing my mind.” Like Dag, Singh started every day with a long-distance run and, like in Dag’s case, the act itself was almost spiritual. “The first 20 miles are not difficult,” Singh said of his experiences as a marathon runner. “As for the last six miles, I run while talking to God.”</p>
<p>Dag didn’t speak to God as he ran, but he did speak of a more personal transcendence, which he struggled to describe other than to say that it was when he was nearing exhaustion that he felt closest to his own mortality. “I have to push to my limitations in order to accept my limitations,” he said.</p>
<p>Dag viewed age as a “state of mind” rather than an actual figure. He had read articles&mdash;which he also cut out and taped into his journals&mdash;about scientific studies that found age-related deterioration to be the side effect of a sedentary lifestyle rather than of aging. He lived by the belief that he could modulate his decline through increased training. And so he ran like few others on the planet and nobody else his age. He had worn out an average of two and a half pairs of running shoes each year ever since 1978, when he started recording such things. It’s how he knew that the Hokas on his feet were the eighty-fifth pair he had bought.</p>
<p>Though he accepted that he was moving slower, Dag tried to maintain the total distance he ran each year by simply increasing the hours he spent training. Where once he could routinely run 10 kilometres in under 40 minutes, it now took him over an hour. He once read that the average human walks roughly 2,200 kilometres a year, a pace that would take them roughly eighteen years to circumnavigate the globe. By contrast, Dag ran about 8,000 kilometres a year. He had reflected on that math, drawn up some calculations, and realized that, despite his age, he was running the equivalent of the entire equator once every five years. He had the logbooks to prove it.</p>
<p>Incredibly, by my calculations, he may have run enough miles during his lifetime to cover the distance between Earth and the moon. Dag shook his head in bewilderment when I told him how far I believed he had travelled. Then he smiled and paraphrased a quote from his childhood hero, Fridtjof Nansen, the Norwegian explorer who led the first crossing of Greenland on skis: “If it’s difficult, I’ll do it right away. If it’s impossible, it will take a little longer.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t was 5:26 p.m.</span>&mdash;9 hours and 26 minutes since the start of the race. Dag was well out of sight, having just run through a cemetery as storm clouds thickened overhead. The skin on his bare legs contracted against the cold as he propelled himself through the cemetery and back into town. His shoes were wearing out, his toes bleeding through his wool socks. He could feel the dampness of his blood cooling against his feet as he planted each step into the gravel on the only route back into Grande Cache.</p>
<p>More and more competitors were now abandoning the race as the temperature dropped toward zero. A race steward’s radio crackled at the nursing station. “We’ve got heavy winds at the top of Hamell,” the voice said. Mount Hamell was the next major peak in Dag’s path&mdash;a 2,100-metre mountain, the highest summit on the Death Race&mdash;a stunning strata with a swooping lookout that offered no protection from the elements. The route near the top of the mountain was devoid of much vegetation longer than grass. Then another voice came over the radio. It said that organizers were preparing to retrieve runners breaking down on the mountainside.</p>
<p>A crash of thunder echoed through the valley. A skeletal figure could be seen cresting the horizon. His pace was steady but slow&mdash;the same as it had been seven hours earlier when I watched him run along an abandoned railway track. His feet chugged along the pavement, and he was humming again&mdash;“As Time Goes By.”</p>
<p>The race clock registered 9:29:31 when Dag crossed the 49-kilometre checkpoint. He had reached the cut-off with 29 seconds to spare. Someone offered him water. He took a sip, handed back the paper cup, stood with his hands on his waist, and looked at the storm over Hamell. It was another 21 kilometres to reach the next checkpoint. I knew, and he knew, as did the stewards watching him, that if he carried on with the race, he was destined to get disqualified at the next cut-off. He looked back to the nursing station.</p>
<p>“I guess this is far enough for one day,” he said.</p>
<p>He raised his arms, filled his lungs with the cold air, looked at his time on the race clock, and shook his head. It was the worst time he had ever recorded.</p>
<p>“Look at that,” he said. “A new record to break.&#8221;</p>

Give me a large book and a horizontal position, and I could fall asleep strapped to the top of a bullet train. Sleep has been a constant ally, a friend. When I was a teen, it was a refuge. I used to pray for sleep; its temporary oblivion was a welcome respite from anxiety and obsessive thoughts. It was a pause, not a death but close enough to it. Every time I fell asleep, there was a chance of resurrection, to wake up new.</p>
<p>My girlfriend, Allison, however, does not think I’m a good sleeper. She knows the truth. At night, I’m thrashing around and screaming. Occasionally, it sounds like my breathing stops. Worst of all for her, I snore. Badly. She’s shown me a video of it, and it’s horrifying: my thin, wheezing inhales are interrupted by a wrenching tear of a noise. It sounds like someone ripping a carpet in half inside a cave. It sounds like a Hans Zimmer score. It’s awful.</p>
<p>We sometimes get into these little fights when I wake up. She’s had a terrible sleep and is justifiably pissed. She can’t stay mad for long, though, because who is she mad at? It wasn’t me snoring, not really. Certainly, it was my body, my lungs, my soft tissues getting flabbier with age and drinking. Those are the guilty parties. But I wasn’t even there. Ask anybody. </p>
<p>When my girlfriend is flipping my sleeping body over and plugging its nose, or occasionally smothering my face with a pillow or two, who is she smothering? How unimportant is the self to our life when we are sleeping&mdash;something we spend a third of our life doing; something that if we didn’t do, we would die&mdash;that it can be completely absent?</p>

</ul>
<p>I tried treating my snoring with the junk-drawer solution of purchasing every anti-snoring device available at Shoppers Drug Mart. Nose strips, mouth guards, some kind of nasal spray&mdash;anything that the store had on sale on those two shelves promising snoring absolution between the Ricolas and the orthotics. Nothing worked. Every time, there would be a slight glimmer of hope, a placebo-infused sleep where we would try to convince ourselves my snoring was better. But, every time, it soon became clear the only difference was that the top of my mouth was now shredded from the cheap plastic of the so-called snore guard. </p>
<p>Allison wanted me to see a doctor about the snoring, but it’s hard to take snoring seriously as a <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/category/society/health/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">health</a> problem. It seems more like a joke, like a health problem that a sitcom dad would have after getting electrocuted by Christmas decorations. It doesn’t seem like a health issue but more like a personality defect. </p>
<p>According to Nick van den Berg, a PhD candidate in experimental psychology at the University of Ottawa and a member of the <a href="https://css-scs.ca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Canadian Sleep Society</a>, “Snoring occurs as our muscles in the upper airway relax so much that they narrow the airway.” This is why snoring gets worse as we get older, as our once taut and virile inner neck muscles become flabby and weak with age. The real threat of bad snoring is it could be a sign you have obstructive sleep apnea&mdash;which is when your airway is completely blocked. This blockage causes you to wake up constantly. The lack of sleep&mdash;for you or your partner&mdash;caused by snoring can be a serious health risk, as insufficient sleep has been linked to cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p>More than the health issues, a lack of sleep can cause almost existential issues. Sleep is essential to your functioning as a human being. “Sleep is key to memory consolidation,” van den Berg told me. It is not entirely clear how, but when we are asleep, our brain organizes, processes, and saves our memory. More than that, he added, “Sleep doesn’t just stabilize our memories but also enhances our memories.” He told me about studies where the subjects are taught a basic skill before bed, and when they wake up, not only do they remember the skill but have actually improved upon it. Sleep, then, is more than necessary; it’s where we are forged. Every night, we throw our day-to-day experiences, memories, and lessons into the kiln of sleep, let them bake for hopefully eight hours, and remove a better, stronger, fuller version of ourselves in the morning.</p>
<p>So my girlfriend was right to insist I deal with the problem, but I was resistant. I’m in my mid-thirties, I haven’t had a doctor since I was a kid. My health care subsisted on walk-in clinic visits and youthful hubris&mdash;a faith that things will work out and a belief that a problem doesn’t really exist until you deal with it. But I think what really scared me off was that going to a doctor about my snoring would be my first confrontation with the way I live and its repercussions, almost like being shown a mirror to my mortality. Certainly not a face to face with the Grim Reaper, seeing who would blink first, but definitely footsies: the first acknowledgement that I’m not impervious to the effects of time and decisions made, that my body has limits, that it can break and fall apart, and that, to live a good life, one has to make good decisions. And as someone who thoroughly enjoys bad decisions, that’s an unpleasant pill to swallow. </p>
<p>It has been a tough year. A friend passed away suddenly and tragically. Then my grandmother followed. A chronic knee problem I had turned into a full-blown meniscus tear, dashing any hopes of a late-life bloom in a guy who is “surprisingly athletic” and revealing a body that is eroding with time. My eyesight became distorted. A visit to the eye doctor revealed I had fluid under my retina, a condition called central serous chorioretinopathy. It’s caused by stress. I started seeing a therapist again. Within minutes, over Zoom, he told me I looked depressed. Things felt harder, time less plentiful. I was reminded that there’s no guarantee that things will just work out. It was a year of the space capsule of my youthful fantasy breaking up on contact with an atmosphere of reality and repercussions, all soundtracked by some of the worst snoring you’ve ever heard.</p>
<p>But there are other things to be afraid of besides <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/aging/">aging</a>, and fearing a breakup or an unexplained disappearance, I tried what Allison had been asking me to do. I went to a doctor. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he doctor</span> asked me how much I drank a week. I gave him a number that was high enough for me to know he should factor it in his diagnosis but low enough that I could say it out loud without being embarrassed. He figured I had sleep apnea and said I should drink less and lose weight. He referred me to a sleep study to confirm the diagnosis. To get a CPAP machine for the apnea, I’d need the study results. A CPAP machine is a device that shoots a steady flow of pressurized oxygen into your nose and mouth. It involves a hose, a mask that covers either your nose or mouth or both, and a head harness, resulting in the wearer looking like a cozy fighter plane pilot, like <em>Top Gun</em>’s Maverick if the undisclosed enemy country were your dreams. </p>
<p>The sleep clinic was in Toronto’s St. Joseph’s Health Centre. I entered the hospital ready to get my sleep on. I felt nervous and excited and blisteringly sober. I had successfully adhered to the guidelines sent out by the clinic: no alcohol in the past twelve hours, no coffee in the last two, and no naps. My mind was unadorned&mdash;free from its usual coating of hangover shame, too-late coffee worry, and post-nap delirium&mdash;and hungry for some answers and clarity.  </p>
<p>Next, a technician saw me and asked a couple of questions, the most provocative being: What position do you sleep in? I’m mostly a mix of side and stomach, with one leg pitched like I’m doing a hurdle. Overall, though, I would describe my sleeping position as maximum obnoxious. My limbs are splayed as far as they can reach, and I am continually thrashing and rolling from side to side in erratic and irregular movements. Basically, I sleep like David Byrne dances.</p>
<p>I sat on my assigned bed, waiting for the sleep lab to begin its work. “Lab” was really a strong word for the experience. There were no beakers, or mad scientists, or stainless-steel tanks with anonymous figures floating in green fluid. There was just a generic hospital room: infinite white walls; a thin, hard bed that felt like I was lying on an H&#038;M clothing shelf; a clunky, foreboding radiator; and a pillow that had all the comfort and support of a bag of napkins. Worst of all, there was an AC unit that something was dripping onto, producing a sharp, arrhythmic, metallic smack.</p>
<p>At quarter to eleven, the technician came in. He was disappointingly less of a mad scientist than I was expecting. Instead, he seemed sleep deprived and grumpy. He began sticking the sensors to my body for the electroencephalogram, or EEG. Created in 1924, this test uses electrodes to measure your brain waves without being invasive (cutting your head open). It is still the gold standard for sleep studies. Sensors were also placed on my arms and legs to measure my movement, and a sensor was placed below my nose and a harness around my chest to measure my breathing. I don’t know what it says about my self-esteem, but I found being a specimen thrilling. The thrill quickly passed as I proceeded to have the worst sleep of my life. </p>
<p>Ideally, there are two types of sleep that can be divided into four stages. The first three stages are of NREM, or non-rapid eye movement, sleep. It is in these three stages that typical sleep occurs. Stage one is the drifting-off period: those fifteen minutes of drowsiness where it is hard to tell if you are asleep or not. Once you are out, the second stage begins. It is marked by slower brain waves and short, fast bursts of brain activity called spindles. Both are thought to be involved in memory consolidation. The third stage of NREM is slow-wave sleep. Your brain waves are now deep, long curves, similar, at times, to those seen in people under anaesthesia. It is in these last two stages of sleep that the majority of restoration happens.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the second act of sleep occurs: REM sleep. The brain explodes with activity; it appears awake. This is when most dreaming occurs, especially the intense, emotional genre of dreams&mdash;the ones that are like “I’m on a date with a book report I didn’t finish” or “I started playing hockey again, but I didn’t realize that my skates are made of everyone I’ve ever disappointed.” Your body reacts accordingly. Beneath the eyelids, your eyes start to dart around wildly, and your heart races. If your body weren’t paralyzed, your limbs would be thrashing around. It’s not entirely clear why this happens. Van den Berg’s favourite theory is that it is preparatory. “If NREM is recovery from the day before, REM seems to be preparation for the day ahead.” This would explain why some dreams can be so intense: they are training modules for the most heightened emotions you can experience.</p>
<p>When you have a good night’s sleep, these different acts and stages are a harmonious cycle. Of course, many things can disrupt this harmony: electric light, caffeine, a long night out, or&mdash;as I found out&mdash;being covered in wires that precariously cling to your body with every toss and turn. Many thoughts can keep you up at night, and in the lab, I discovered a new one: “I sure hope that when I turned over, I didn’t ruin this experiment being performed on me.” Another pressure point in the delicate dance of the sleep stages is if there is an unceasing arrhythmic drip onto an air conditioning unit the entire night and the drip sounds like someone didn’t turn off the tap in your brain&mdash;a drip that erodes who you are, who you were, and who you would be into a howling nothingness begging for sweet release. </p>
<p>I was woken up at five-thirty after maybe two hours of gruel-thin snoozing. The wires were removed, and I strolled home in the dawn light, feeling like my sleep–wake cycle and circadian rhythms were utterly and completely ruined. I didn’t know what kind of information they could glean from my dire snooze, but I learned that there were limits to my sleeping abilities, and one of them was getting the Weapon X treatment.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">fter two months</span>, the results of the study came in. There was no sleep apnea. I have what the report called “mild primary snoring.” As far as the study could tell, there is no particular reason for it. Aging, drinking too much, and rapidly deteriorating neck muscles are all it takes. The snoring wasn’t a condition; it was the sound of time catching up to me.</p>
<p>These were not the results I was looking for. I had been hoping for a condition, a disorder, another of life’s petty aggrievements I could list and point to whenever I indulged in a self-pity wallow. I wanted a quick fix even if that quick fix was strapping a glorified bike pump to my face. Instead, what I got was consequences. I used to not believe in consequences. Not really. I thought I could do what I wanted. Any suffering that came along was something I didn’t have control over; it was something to get used to, like the weather. The responsibility you have to yourself and others eluded me. But decisions have consequences, and they aren’t a one-time deal. Instead, they coalesce and compound and reverberate, like a snore off the inner walls of your throat. There is no guarantee things will just work out: injuries worsen, tragedy happens, your girlfriend gets fed up with you snoring. When you don’t sleep, you don’t just get it back by sleeping in the next day. It takes days for you to recover.</p>
<p>My snoring has gotten worse since the study. Louder, more frequent. Thankfully, my girlfriend and I have figured out a staggered sleep schedule that seems to work. More than that, I’d like to think I’m trying. I’m working out more, eating slightly better, drinking less. From this study, I learned you are not just your moment-to-moment thoughts and feelings. You are an accumulation of everything you did before. The person you are today builds from the person you were the day before: when you ate, what you learned, how you slept. You have to take care of yourself and others. Things aren’t just going to get better on their own.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/stop-snoring/">How I Tried to Stop Snoring, Fix My Sleep Habits, and Confront My Mortality</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

I love the shock on people’s faces when I tell them how old I am (“No! You can’t be!”), and I’m proud of the many times I’ve stumped the guy at the guess-your-age booth at the Canadian National Exhibition. I credit this, in part, to a secret formula. It’s not quite the fountain of youth, but it’s the greatest anti-aging potion ever discovered: swimming in cold water. </p>
<p>I get asked on a near-daily basis, “What could possess a person to go into freezing-cold water voluntarily?”</p>
<p>Or, put more simply: “Are you crazy?”</p>
<p>My love affair with cold-water swimming didn’t really get going until I was nearly fifty. I’ve always had a high tolerance for the cold, which I suspect is partly genetic. In the dead of winter, my father used to go out hatless, with the front of his coat unbuttoned. People would say, “Mac, how can you stand it?” Now they say much the same to me.</p>
<p>When my body entered the inexorable process known as menopause, “the change” came with the standard panoply of negative effects: mood swings, insomnia, depression, the works. As for hot flashes, what I had weren’t intermittent surges of body heat. No, I felt hot all the time. Inside, outside, no matter the weather. Raging, unremitting heat—except when I was in the water. Even in normal summer water temperatures of twenty degrees or higher, swimming helped cool me down, though warm weather itself was also a kind of curse. </p>
<ul class="related">

</ul>
<p>I struggled with depressed moods for years before I learned that “reverse SAD,” or summer seasonal affective disorder, was a real diagnosis. That, combined with my menopausal turmoil, was what drove me to explore cold-water “treatment” before I even knew there was such a thing. Autumn, when the lake temperatures started to drop, was my season of relief. Over time, even as early winter arrived, I just kept on going, long after everyone else had left the beach. Most days, it was just me and the occasional dog.</p>
<p>As the water grew colder, I found myself experiencing real freedom&mdash;not just from my internal inferno but also from my gloomy outlook and terrible mood swings. Cold water brought back my interest in life. It gave me back my joy.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smallcaps">elieve it or not</span>, humans have been voluntarily immersing themselves in cold water for a long time. A survey of cold-water immersion practices through the centuries simultaneously yields a kind of capsule history of science itself. Many animals, such as walruses, polar bears, and most fish, thrive in cold water, but we humans are understandably wary of its danger and extreme discomfort.</p>
<p>It’s hard to think of an activity that screams, “Buyer beware!” more than plunging into freezing-cold water, but claims for the health benefits of cold water date back to antiquity. Hippocrates, the great Greek physician, was a proponent of water therapy in general and cold water in particular.</p>
<p>For centuries, claims that cold-water swimming improved human health and well‐being were based largely on folk wisdom and anecdotal accounts. That began to change in the late eighteenth century with the work of Scottish physician James Currie, who used cold water in the successful treatment of a contagious fever in Liverpool. In 1797, he published an influential pamphlet, <em>Medical Reports on the Effects of Water, Cold and Warm, as a Remedy in Fevers and Other Diseases</em>, that contains the first English record of clinical observations using a thermometer.</p>
<p>The practice of sea bathing became popular around the same period, and coastal countries saw the growth of seaside resorts to capitalize on the perceived health benefits of salt water. In 1846, Victorian physician James Gully published <em>The Water-Cure in Chronic Diseases</em>, describing the pioneering hydrotherapy treatments at his clinic in Malvern, England, where famous patients included Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, and Florence Nightingale. The hydrotherapy movement crossed the Atlantic in 1866 with the establishment of John Harvey Kellogg’s sanatorium in Battle Creek, Michigan. The popularity of hydrotherapy diminished with the rise of modern medicine, and cold water was consigned to the category of things to be avoided at all costs.</p>
<p>Because humans are terrestrial creatures, not aquatic, the bulk of our science on human adaptation to cold has concerned itself with cold climate rather than cold water. It’s a bit of a mystery that humans have any ability to tolerate cold at all, since the scientific consensus is that <em>Homo sapiens</em> migrated out of the tropical environment of Africa thousands of years ago. Some researchers lean toward the view that our cold adaptability stems from genetic material handed down to us by our Neanderthal ancestors. </p>
<p>In recent years, groundbreaking work in cold-water immersion has been carried out at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. Michael Tipton is a professor of human and applied physiology there. His colleague Heather Massey studies human physiological responses to cold and other extreme conditions. In addition to being researchers, both Tipton and Massey are athletes: Tipton is an Ironman triathlete; Massey is a seasoned cold-water swimmer who completed a solo crossing of the English Channel in 2019. The fact that they are both scientists and active participants in their subject of study gives their work a real-life applicability, acknowledging both the risks of cold-water immersion and the fact that people want to do it anyway. (Combining her passions, Massey sometimes swallows wireless thermometer capsules so she can monitor her body temperature during swims.) </p>
<p>In early 2021, Tipton set out to debunk some of what he called the “flawed beliefs” circulating among cold-water devotees, in particular the idea that swimmers can extend their habituation to the cold for longer and longer periods. In fact, Tipton says, repeated exposure to cold water can produce what he termed a “hypothermic” adaptation, in which the acclimated individuals shiver little or not at all and paradoxically feel comfortable even as their deep body temperature falls. In other words, some open-water swimmers&mdash;particularly those who are well acclimatized to cold&mdash;can lose the ability to judge how cold their bodies actually are.</p>
<p>Tipton gives the chilling example (no pun intended) of Jason Zirganos, a legendary marathon swimmer who completed four progressively faster crossings of the English Channel in the early 1950s. He was the first person to complete the Triple Crown of Open Water Swimming, which, besides the English Channel, includes crossing the Catalina Channel, in California, and circumnavigation of Manhattan island. There’s some controversy over his Manhattan island swim, with reports that toward the end he had to be pulled, almost completely unconscious, from the water. Like so many elite swimmers, he was always determined to outdo himself, and in 1959, he embarked on a thirty-five-kilometre swim across the North Channel from Northern Ireland to Scotland, in water around thirteen degrees. At no time during the swim did he claim to feel cold, yet Zirganos had to be pulled from the water again. He was in the throes of hypothermia, and despite efforts to revive him, he later died. </p>
<p>In Tipton’s words, Zirganos “swam to unconsciousness” because, over time, his body had lost the physical signal that he was getting too cold. Over the years, I’ve noticed some version of this in myself. You can get almost too used to cold water. From the first time your body tries to tell you&mdash;very sensibly&mdash;that it doesn’t want to be there, and through regular immersion, you unlearn that series of reactions. </p>
<p>Many people say they begin cold-water swimming to stretch themselves, go beyond their limits. Tipton’s message is a continual reminder that the human body has very real limits in its ability to deal with cold water. They may vary from person to person, and they can change with time and circumstances. But we ignore them at our peril. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smallcaps">n the afternoon</span> of September 2, 2017, I walked into Lake Ontario. Nothing remarkable about that. Over the past three decades, I’ve probably gone into the water off Ward’s Island more than a thousand times. This was just another day at the beach, and yet it was something more than that. I was embarking on a <em>challenge</em>.</p>
<p>I resolved to swim seventy kilometres between September 2 and October 24, 2017, the day I would turn seventy. It wasn’t going to be a particularly daunting task. I had fifty-two days to achieve my goal, which worked out to a pace of less than one and a half kilometres (almost a mile) a day. I swim that much as a matter of routine during the summer months, but this was early autumn, and I figured I’d need a head start before Lake Ontario began to cool down. By late October, the temperature would have dropped to ten to twelve degrees. I’d keep swimming, of course, but I’d have to cut down my time in the water.</p>
<p>As the kilometres added up and I got closer and closer to the end point, I found an ambivalence, even a kind of melancholy, creeping into my mood. Forty may be the new thirty, sixty the new fifty. But seventy? Seventy isn’t the “new” anything. It’s just old. Even the day I swam the last kilometre, I didn’t feel triumphant the way I had on completing my 365-day swim the year before. I wasn’t at all sure that turning seventy was something to celebrate. But it amazes me that, as I move into old age, I’ve finally found something I can do that few other people can. I’m not really brave or tough, though I enjoy that people think I am. Cold-water swimming is the only physical activity that I am, by some miracle, innately good at. It has made my life immeasurably better.</p>
<p>There are people who are indifferent to water. There are people who hate getting wet. And there are people like me who can’t see a body of water without thinking about jumping into it. I love being in water. I can’t live without it. In more ways than I can count, swimming has come to define my life. As I become more acutely aware that my time on this planet&mdash;consisting mostly of water&mdash;is diminishing, it’s truer than ever.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">lthough</span> my memory of the details is vague, I think the following happened when I was eight years old, living in a village in central Saskatchewan and attending a one-room school with grades one through eight. Probably it was a hot day in June, we girls were wearing summer dresses, and because it was most likely a Friday afternoon, when everybody tends to slack off (or did in those days), our young teacher had sent us outside, around to the back of the school, to our baseball diamond. There, we were all&mdash;somehow, despite our being different ages, sizes, and genders&mdash;organized to play softball. I didn’t enjoy sports, wasn’t athletic, was a tiny child, and was bored. I remember standing in the batting lineup forever, as there was double the required number to a side, until finally it would be my turn and I would be berated by my teammates when I would inevitably strike out. Because of all this, after a while, I wandered away from the game, around to the front of the empty school, and sat down, alone, on the wooden steps leading inside. Eventually, a sweating older girl came panting around the side of the building, looking for a drink of water. Seeing me, she hesitated and asked why I was sitting there by myself. I probably said that I didn’t want to play ball&mdash;our mother didn’t allow us to shrug our shoulders or say “I dunno” when she spoke to us, so I would have said something. She went on inside and at once came rushing back out, swiping water from her chin, and ran back to the game. </p>
<p>She must have told the teacher where I was. “Oh,” the teacher must have said, and knowing I wouldn’t be getting into mischief, seeing no other reason to insist I come back, the teacher left me there. This was just after the Second World War, when experienced teachers were in short supply. Ours was a teenager herself, with zero knowledge of child psychology, and she probably just couldn’t be bothered. So I sat alone, listening to the crack of the bat on the ball and the cries of my classmates floating to me through the warm spring air over the roof of the school.</p>
<p>But, mostly, I remember sitting there, elbows on my knees, chin resting on my palms, and feeling&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;what? Peaceful and quiet, I think, aware of myself as alone in a wide noisy world yet enjoying my distance from it, if also feeling the creeping approach of loneliness. The boundary between solitude and loneliness is permeable and unstable, after all. I remember that, after a while, I got up off the steps and went back to the game. I remember that I found the teacher playing in the infield, sweat trickling down her temple, and when she glanced at me, her expression was somewhere between annoyed and indifferent. I already knew that look from my too-busy mother, who had five children under eleven to worry about, and I was by this time&mdash;at eight&mdash;girded against it.</p>
<p>Seventy years later, I still recall this moment, although without the shame I once associated with it&mdash;my peculiarities, my sullenness&mdash;as being when my status as a loner and a pursuer of solitude was cemented. Yet I and those friends my age who admit to suffering from loneliness do everything that remains within our power (not being able to bring the dead back to life or get rid of their own Parkinson’s, arthritis, congestive heart failure) to relieve or dispel loneliness. I tell myself that everybody feels this emotion. It is some help but not much, and my inability to find the right or true source or cause of my loneliness is as painful as the loneliness itself.</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smallcaps">hen I was</span> thirty-six, I left my lowly university-lecturer job in a small city to marry a cattle rancher whose land was in a sparsely populated and remote part of southwest Saskatchewan where, in time, I came to understand that I would never be fully accepted. Thirty-three years later, a widow dreaming of a new life (or to recreate my original one), I moved to Calgary to be near my grandchildren. Otherwise, I knew virtually no one there, and years later, my family gone to Ontario, I still don’t have extensive or deep social connections. Ever since I left that remote Prairie home and chose the city, I have had the sense that my “real life,” the place where I belong and where there is no loneliness, is somewhere else out there in the world, although I can’t name or find it.</p>
<p>I’m eighty now and I live alone, a situation so common that you might even say loneliness goes hand in hand with being old, that the old are experts in loneliness. There is, however, a stigma attached to being lonely&mdash;being lonely must be your own fault because you’re an inferior person&mdash;while, if you claim to enjoy solitude, you are seen as not of the typical run of humanity and are admired, even while being looked at skeptically, because in our society, preferring to be alone isn’t seen as “normal” or well adjusted. Also, there is the tired disclaimer that you can be lonely while among people&mdash;and even in marriage&mdash;a cliché that, while true, only irritates those who are truly, physically alone in the world, such as orphans or the old whose family and friends are all too debilitated to connect with others or are dead.</p>
<p>We also all know, or at some juncture in our lives discover, that loneliness in North America is pervasive and thought to be caused by the cult of the individual, the nuclear family, the rise of narcissism, globalization, and late-stage capitalism. As an old person, I live in the midst of a community of loneliness&mdash;admittedly a contradiction in terms: How do the lonely make a community and remain lonely? But, somehow, we manage it. The COVID-19 requirements of physical distancing and isolation have resulted in the sad, even alarming fact that loneliness is now more widespread through our society than it’s ever been.</p>
<p>It is only when, having some long, heightened personal experience with loneliness, you decide to write an essay on this newly (again) trendy subject that you discover what a voluminous literature there is about it, from modern studies done by government departments to personal essays, from sixteenth-century Michel de Montaigne’s “On Solitude” to psychiatrist Anthony Storr’s 1988 <em>Solitude: A Return to the Self</em>. Both conclude that solitude is good while loneliness is bad and that loneliness is a complex emotion, state, condition. Put the topic in the hands of philosophers and you will soon find it is almost beyond your ability to understand their deep probing of the subject, examining related concepts of grief, sorrow, depression&mdash;even homesickness, although in old people, homesickness is usually for the no longer extant home or for a home that, even if one went back and stood in the middle of it, wouldn’t be the right, longed-for home anymore. And that would be loneliness.</p>
<p>I am surprised to find that friends my own age who, before COVID-19, took part in the activities of a number of organizations and so were out of their homes and with congenial people often&mdash;friends who never spent three to five days completely alone, the phone not even ringing unless it was the cursed telephone marketers&mdash;people who never used to go three to five days with no one knocking on the door and who didn’t have to go to the grocery store or post office or even to the doctor just to have a human conversation, claim still to be lonely. How can this be?</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smallcaps">e look back</span> through our lives, thinking that loneliness didn’t strike us at all when we were young, except&mdash;oh, yes&mdash;in certain rare, specific situations: mom in the hospital, siblings gone somewhere without you, being sent off to the relatives while your parents holidayed, starting a new school, that kind of thing. Or, later, in adulthood: betrayal, divorce, living alone, changing cities, children leaving home, without the money to do whatever it is you want to do, dreaming of some life you can never have. Now, in old age, though, we are baffled by our loneliness no matter what we do to alleviate it; we resent it and start searching through the past to try to discover how we have come to this.</p>
<p>In a 2013 essay for <em>The New Republic</em> called “The Lethality of Loneliness,” Judith Shulevitz writes, “Loneliness is made as well as given, and at a very early age. Deprive us of the attention of a loving, reliable parent, and, if nothing happens to make up for that lack, we’ll tend toward loneliness for the rest of our lives. Not only that, but our loneliness will probably make us moody, self-doubting, angry, pessimistic, shy, and hyper-sensitive to criticism. Recently, it has become clear that some of these problems reflect how our brains are shaped from our first moments of life.”</p>
<p>When I read this, I froze, so accurate a description it was of the tendencies that I fight in order to live a more “normal” life, of how I have gradually, over the many years of my adulthood, come to see myself as having been. That is, in order to not die of self-imposed loneliness. And, still, before COVID-19, I would catch myself dodging out of an event as soon as it ended, right when everybody else was gathering to network, bond, cement alliances, gossip, chat, and just have a little fun for half an hour before, satisfied, they would turn toward home. Or else I would refuse a social invitation because it intimidated me too much, even though everybody else would have a good time, and I probably would have too, if I could have just mustered the courage to initiate conversations or if I hadn’t thought that the slightest, most fleeting expression meant the person I was talking to was bored by me or had taken a dislike to me. That I had, once again, said something immeasurably stupid or offensive or had made an enemy when I was trying to make a friend. Rather than suffer through that again, I would tell myself, <em>I would rather be alone</em>. Even though COVID-19 has greatly exacerbated loneliness, I doubt, when it’s over and I get used to going out again, I’ll feel any different.</p>
<p>Not all the roots of loneliness grow from childhood. When I first became aware of myself as old, and when both of my parents, two of my four sisters, and my husband had died (the other two sisters, as well as my son and his family, live in other provinces, too far from me to visit casually even without COVID-19), leaving me pretty much permanently alone&mdash;in the physical sense, at the very least&mdash;I began to feel like the last member of my tribe left on earth. For the first time, I understood, in the deepest part of my being, what the true loneliness of orphans and of those who define themselves or are defined by society as “other,” as not belonging, really is. I began to understand why the elderly are too often lonely people. But this is a kind of loneliness that is attached to being in the flesh, to once having been firmly related to others, to once having been a member of a large family or community. The soul remains connected to the dead, as if they were all still alive, but the body is bereft, and the mind rests in a kind of melancholy, awed confusion, and dismay. More than once, I have heard old people say, in a puzzled, sad way, something like, “I have outlived my life.” I have said it myself. How can it be that I remain alive and on earth when the significant people of the life I have lived are now only ghosts? I have overstayed my life; my still being alive is a mistake; surely, I was meant to go when they did.</p>
<p>When I consider my own loneliness, now, in my old age, as I have done both on purpose and inadvertently, I count my blessings: a nice home; enough money to pay my bills; pretty good health for my age; a few good old friends in other provinces I can talk to on the phone; a few new friends with whom, before the virus and its isolation, I used to visit and with whom I went to movies and plays; a brain that, though not as good as it once was, is still working well enough. This cures me for the moment, COVID-19 or not, but let my guard down and there it is again, like a mangy grey coyote that shadows me everywhere and that lay, forgotten by me, at my feet under the table when I was lunching with a friend, my loneliness problem solved until the moment the door latch clicked behind her and that coyote crawled out and rubbed against my leg once more. And I am baffled by this too, and thoroughly annoyed with myself because I knew&mdash;I know&mdash;better, if only I could remember what I know.</p>
<p>I was lonely after my husband died, in 2007, because I had no “significant other” reading the newspaper in the other room. But, as I adjusted to my single state, stifling that yearning, I turned to philosophers for instruction on the good life, the happy life, and in reading them, I suddenly remembered a teaching from many years ago, when I was wandering alone on the prairie one day, immensely sad, full of self-pity, and trying to understand where my dismal feelings came from.</p>
<p>There really was no one thing that I could pinpoint: I was sad because I was alive and did not have every single thing I had ever wanted, did not even know all the things I wanted, and I believe now that it was the latter that made me saddest. I was alive and I was a human being and wanting is the condition of the human. Words appeared in my head, or perhaps it was what I have called the “voiceless voice” that spoke to me. <em>This too is illusion</em>, it said, and at once, it straightened my head right around. Wisdom may sometimes come in such a flash, but I have learned you must stick with it or it will leave you as clueless as you were before it lit.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="smallcaps">oneliness</span> isn’t a social construct in itself, although social conditions can certainly create it: the loneliness of the prisoner, the loneliness of those doomed to live a life they think is not the one they would have chosen for themselves, the loneliness of the elderly caused by ageism. To suffer from loneliness is part of the human condition and must always have existed.</p>
<p>But it hasn’t always been named as such. William Shakespeare, our greatest expert on everything human, left behind no indelible quotes about loneliness, as he did for just about every other human experience, despite being credited with coining the term “lonely.” We, as readers, have never looked to him as someone who wrote about the subject. Was this because, for him, loneliness was fully tied to the condition of being unhappily in love? Or was it about the supposed loneliness of the dead? Nonetheless, Shakespeare’s tragic heroes certainly suffered from what we would today simply call loneliness. King Lear, Hamlet, Timon of Athens, Coriolanus, and Titus Andronicus, in their extremities of rage, grief, and humiliation, were also lonely people.</p>
<p>Thomas Dumm, in <em>Loneliness as a Way of Life</em>, writes that “the very texture of modern life is inflected by loneliness.” Thinking of the West, at least, who could disagree? Although Dumm, a professor of political science, goes on to write that loneliness permeates our entire experience of living and that it is also political because of the way it helps us understand and shape not just the meaning of our individuality but also how we use power and justice in the world. It is so ubiquitous an experience that, in January 2018, in response to a UK report finding that about 9 million people (out of 67 million surveyed) reported themselves as lonely and the fact that loneliness can be responsible for a decline in health, the British government appointed a so-called minister of loneliness. In late 2018, the government began serious work on a loneliness strategy, with the overarching department introducing a number of programs it believed would help alleviate the condition. (Currently, the “minister of loneliness” position no longer exists, though loneliness is the purview of the same department.) This February, alarmed by the increase in suicides it linked to the increased isolation of COVID-19, the Japanese government also appointed a minister to oversee loneliness.</p>
<p>In Canada, governments are starting to pay attention to the problem and devise ways of alleviating it where they find it: chiefly, but not exclusively, among senior citizens. A good thing, because two Angus Reid Institute studies show that, in 2019, 55 percent of the population identified as having a good social life, but in 2020, the figure had dropped to 33 percent. The percentage of those reporting as not suffering from either loneliness or social isolation had dropped from 22 percent to 12 percent. But those suffering from both social isolation and loneliness (separated by the researchers, with sufferers of both referred to as “The Desolate”) had increased from 23 percent to 33 percent. In 2020, one-third of our population was “desolate” from isolation and loneliness.</p>
<p>As if the simple continual longing for company isn’t devastating enough, researchers have demonstrated that social isolation results in a weaker immune system, making the lonely more vulnerable to disease. A 2010 review of 148 studies on the health effects of social isolation found that they exceeded the health risks associated with obesity, inactivity, heavy drinking, air pollution, and smoking.</p>
<p>I have to question what agencies and programs designed to alleviate loneliness and instill a sense of community can do for the suffering. Besides offering transportation for people with disabilities and elderly people and language classes for non-English speakers, they can provide funding and leadership to create clubs and organizations designed especially for those groups defined as lonely. In some cases, all this may help quite a few people. But, in most of us, the fundamental condition will remain, even if at a diminished level, and for most of us, it ebbs and flows throughout our lives.</p>
<p>“We are all lonely, even when amid crowds and in committed relationships,” writes psychoanalyst James Hollis in <em>Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life: How to Finally, Really Grow Up.</em> “When we are alone, we are still with someone; we are with ourselves. The question is how are we with ourselves?” Loneliness opens us up to self-questioning, sometimes to the obsessive mental repetition of past experiences and accompanying emotions, often to overpowering, helpless contrition for past deeds and words, to heightened mourning over our many losses, and to hopelessness. When you’re alone, there is little to distract you from your thoughts, and if you have no one to talk to, your ideas about who you are and who you have been can ramp themselves up until rational perspective departs. Such suffering over your life can lead to despair. But Hollis writes that, if you have respect for yourself and if you pay attention to your dreams and “other such phenomena,” you may find help with your loneliness from a deeper place within yourself. This is a psychoanalytic solution, deeply learned and intensely felt, and one that most people would be grateful for (and it will probably be as far as most of us get), but I think that, as helpful as such communing with the deeper self undeniably is, this response is still not quite the full answer to the problem of loneliness. It shouldn’t be forgotten that we are all afraid, even the greatest heroes and heroines among us. My own feeling is that perhaps the empty spot that pains us so deeply is, as I have written, yearning for what we have lost&mdash;our mother, spouse, child, original home, the way of life we left behind. “Our loneliness is always deepest in those moments when we face the terror of nothing,” writes Dumm in <em>Loneliness as a Way of Life</em>. “But nothing rarely appears as itself; instead, it takes on many guises, most of which connect back to the ultimate nothing, death, or non-existence, that blank page.”</p>
<p>And how do we deal with that? I think of myself as a person with a long history of being stifled by my own fears, and now, in old age, I think of the foolish ones: to drive in heavy traffic, to visit places where I know no one, to go out at night. I have wondered about them, berated myself over them, tried to overcome them, but I think I see now that, although there is much out there for old people to be afraid of, I suspect my fears are, in the end, related to my approaching nothingness&mdash;“that blank page.”</p>
<p>One of the things that most puzzled me during the more than thirty years I spent with my husband in what was for me rural solitude&mdash;partly because I didn’t fit into rural society and partly because I chose the work of learning to be a writer, which further isolated me&mdash;was that, even as I was often brought to an absolute physical halt by the natural beauty I was seeing, I was at the same time stricken painfully in the heart by the sight. Looking closer, I identified it as yearning, and then, in the end, I gave it the name of loneliness.</p>
<p>If I were more religious than I am, I might say that the feeling was yearning for the place we came from before we were born. But I don’t quite believe that, although I would like to. Perhaps, instead, it is about the human search for perfection, the perfection we find only in great works of art and out in the landscape. I think that we yearn for perfect peace, which doesn’t mean being in perfect solitude, or comatose, or brain dead, but for peace in the heart&mdash;a peaceful heart in the midst of the multitudes, tumult, chaos, violence, sorrow, and the beauty of everyday life. We can never have that peace, except in the work of art or the sunset, but instead, we have intimations of it, and that is why we feel sadness.</p>
<p><span class="pull-quote">Wisdom suggests that we learn to focus on the now, forget the past, and stop worrying about the future. Only then do we erase loneliness. </span></p>
<p>I have at times forgotten all about loneliness and, if asked, would have offered denial. My goodness, it’s hard to be lonely in the middle of sex: the act occupies you rather fully, at least for a few minutes. And I wasn’t lonely giving birth, although I was frightened, in pain, and perhaps indignant that this was bloody well asking too much of me. Or when I held my dearest preschooler tightly in my arms. Moments, flashes, the occasional long afternoon in the countryside, when dreaming, when lost in my work, in the “zone” athletes talk about, when struggling to understand an idea, whenever I am focused on something. Nor was I lonely when I was walking on the prairie alone and my consciousness moved out beyond its normal limits and allowed me a larger sense of the world. </p>
<p>It took nearly eighty years of living through happy things and sad things and torments of every kind that beset the human before I began to see how right the philosophers were: we are creatures of desire, creatures of the imagination, and to subdue these natural and vital processes takes a lifetime of repeated experience and the work that follows. No wonder wisdom suggests that we learn to focus on the now, forget the past, and stop worrying about the future. Only then does the sorrow vanish, only then do we erase loneliness. But, I think, at what great cost to the exploration of the richness of life and to individual human possibilities. </p>
<p>Still, sometimes I wonder how my life would have changed if, that day beside the school, my young teacher had come looking for me and, speaking to me encouragingly, had brought me to the others and ensured that I found a place in the game. Maybe I was waiting for her to do that, although I remember soon realizing that nobody would, one of the first revelations of my life. I was all alone, by my own not-exactly-choosing, since I wanted to be with the other kids but also wanted something else. Perhaps my need for solitude, despite its sometime companion loneliness, had been instilled in my soul long before I entered school, maybe at conception, and it would be up to me, as I grew, to find a balance where I could. </p>

I studied art history instead. I loved art, but I loved the artists more. It was their stories that I burned for. In an oral presentation on Michelangelo’s sculptures, during the third year of my art history degree, I mused over the artist’s romantic life. I speculated that he had been in love with his sculptures, a <em>Pygmalion</em> analysis. Also, his best sculptures were of men, so I was curious about his sexuality. I’d chosen slides from the art history library to illustrate my thesis, including the muscular twist of the <em>Rebellious Slave</em>; the smooth-bodied, hedonistic, and confident <em>Bacchus</em>; and, of course, <em>David</em>, with his youthful defiance, his tousled hair, and the details of his body so fine you could see his veins through his skin. He was beautiful, heartbreakingly so. How could the sculptor not have loved him? The lights were dimmed, my professor stood behind the slide projector so that her eyes were obscured by the machine’s bright lights, but I could see her mouth, which had tightened into a firm line.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” she said, signalling the end of my presentation. “More interpretation of the work, less speculation on the artist’s personal life, please.”</p>
<p>We were meant to be post-artist at the close of the twentieth century, instructed to understand the work as its own text, as standing apart from its maker. For a time, I complied. The artwork drew me in, and it fed me, but this method of understanding art left me hungry for more of the artist, unsated.</p>

<p>Over the winter of 2017, I read the biographies of great artists, sometimes from back to front, sometimes only the final chapters. It was a road map of sorts, a necessary outline for a blankness that existed in art and literature surrounding old age. As writer and editor Diana Athill, approaching ninety, wrote, “There is not much on record about falling away.” Author Roger Angell, writing at ninety, said old age could feel like blankness, invisibility. He would speak at a dinner party and hear silence in return. “Hello? Didn’t I just say something?” he mused. “Have I left the room?” </p>
<p>Reading their lives backward, I experienced the deaths of Cézanne, Renoir, Monet, Krasner, Neel, O’Keeffe, and Turner all in one season, because the artist always died in the final pages. (The biographer has the good fortune of knowing how she will tie her writing project together.) Paul Cézanne collapsed during a rainstorm while live-painting outdoors, <em>sur le motif</em>, lying unconscious for hours before being carried home on a laundry cart. He rallied, occasionally, over the next few days, finishing a portrait, adding some small brushes of colour to a painting near his bed, <em>Still Life with Carafe, Bottle, and Fruit</em>, and died in the early morning.</p>
<div class="su-pullquote su-pullquote-align-left">
<h4 style="color:#fb5954;">My father had always been an outlier in his talent and in his unswerving, dogged focus on art; still, in the lastingness of his creativity, he might be just like everyone else.</h4>
</div>
<p>J. M. W. Turner asked to see the sun, one last time, as he lay dying under an overcast sky. He was rewarded on the morning of his death, when the sun broke through the clouds and briefly illuminated his room. He died before noon. He communicated from the afterlife in the body of a teenage medium, the daughter of an ironworks foreman. She embodied the hunched creep of his later years, his furrowed brow. She enacted the motion of his long brushstrokes as she mimed the act of washing-in a canvas, readying it for a new painting, and she mimicked his technique of using a cloth to soften the colours on the canvas, blurring the painted weather and industrial steam. In doing this, she gave away the artistic secrets of Turner’s later career.</p>
<p>In her twenties, suffering from depression, twentieth-century American artist Alice Neel tried repeatedly to kill herself&mdash;tied a stocking around her neck, put her head in a gas oven&mdash;but she lived to eighty-four and died of cancer, surrounded by her family in the New York City apartment that doubled as her studio.</p>
<p>Pierre-August Renoir was bedridden and went into pulmonary arrest hours after asking for a pencil with which to sketch a nearby vase. His gathered family couldn’t find one, according to a letter written by his son, Jean. But how hard did they try? I wondered. Surely a pencil could be proffered without much trouble in the house of a dying artist. Of course, in place of Les Colletes, Renoir’s estate in Cagnes-sur-Mer, France, I imagined the Loyalist home in Colborne, Ontario, where my parents lived, substituting familiar territory, my known life, as one does when reading the stories of others.</p>
<p>As each artist approached the end, the urge to create did not wane. It may have grown faint, necessarily, but the impulse to make art remained. They rose from their deathbeds to paint, asked for their tools in delirium. People who loved them bent low over their prone bodies, whispering of success, assuring them that people were still looking at the art they’d created over their lifetimes. Even Turner, unable to paint, still yearned for the light that shone through his late, great works.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smallcaps">e tend</span> not to associate aging with creative bursts. Historically, critics saw advancements by elderly artists as peculiar. According to twentieth-century art historian Kenneth Clark, the work of older artists conveyed a feeling of “transcendental pessimism,” best illustrated in the weary lined eyes and pouched cheeks of Rembrandt’s late self-portraits. Claude Monet’s contemporaries decried his <em>Water Lilies</em> series as a symptom of cataracts and advanced age. The paintings were dismissed as “the work of an old man” in <em>Comoedia</em>, France’s most important daily arts journal at the time. Fellow painter André Lhote described them as “artistic suicide.” In Turner’s final two decades, as he painted the weather, both natural and manmade, in his increasingly abstract landscapes, he found himself brutalized by peers, a kind of aesthetic elder abuse. Turner was “without hope,” wrote John Ruskin. Another, less tactful critic said that Turner’s late work was the product of “senile decrepitude.”</p>
<p>“Now it’s recognized that there was not a falling off of creative powers but that their creative powers have changed,” says Ross King, author of <em>Mad Enchantment: Claude Monet and the Painting of the Water Lilies</em>. “They were deliberately working in different ways.” One brushstroke from Monet&mdash;a silhouette of a petal at dusk&mdash;holds all the shadow, richness, and texture of a life as a painter. But this is something that people often overlook. Today, it’s doubtful that most gallery patrons know that Monet was in his seventies when he created the most famous paintings in his <em>Water Lilies</em> series. Turner’s late creations are now widely recognized as works of incomparable brilliance. The same could be said of art from Cézanne, Titian, Michelangelo, and Rembrandt.</p>
<p>Lately, well-wishers have been describing the continued art practice of my father, Tony Urquhart, as “remarkable.” I sensed that his longevity and work ethic delighted them, the idea of the old artist at his easel, but I also intuited a deeper emotional response, that they were surprised by his continued creativity, and that “remarkable” was code for peculiar or strange. As we stood before my father’s early painting <em>The Earth Returns to Life</em>, considering the progress of time, I wondered when and why our society had been conditioned to see creativity and aging as antagonistic. My father had always been an outlier in his talent and in his unswerving, dogged focus on art; still, in the lastingness of his creativity, he might be just like everyone else.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">here is a term,</span> “successful aging,” that has come to define a certain type of senior, one who accomplishes astonishing tasks in the final gasp of their life. These are people like the ninety-six-year-old who ran the New York City Marathon or the 101-year-old who released her first collection of poems. It began as a movement to counter ageism&mdash;<em>See what we can accomplish at any age!</em>&mdash;but celebrating the exceptional suggests that the regular human narrative is somehow a failure. The privilege of growing old can be as much luck as circumstance. A marginalized childhood, malnutrition, and stress can all shape the later years of life. There is also the simple, bewildering fact that some bodies are able to deal with hardships and tragedies better than others. In old age, there are many roads diverging, with no real control over which path anyone might end up on. </p>
<p>There are exciting new thoughts on the story of being old, but we’re all fallible to age. It isn’t something to overcome, to rage against and win over. A study of senior artists in Canada found that 73 percent, or 29,000, of the 40,000 artists polled were at a moderate or high health risk. Even the seemingly impermeable older artists featured in art history textbooks faced the realities of aging. Monet suffered from cataracts; Renoir from painful arthritis; Edgar Degas was blind near the end; and Lee Krasner, who had waited all her career to see her work celebrated at The Museum of Modern Art, died unexpectedly, in her seventies, before her one-woman show was mounted. She knew it was happening, her biographer wrote. Whether this was enough, we can’t know. There was Saloua Choucair, the Lebanese artist whose fame came in her eighties and nineties and who was alive but too deep into dementia to witness her soaring late success.</p>

<p>Each of these artists struggled in some way, as we all do or will, with the progress of time. Yet Renoir found new ways to hold his brush in the tight grip of his folded hands, and Monet saw through his cataracts&mdash;or maybe he painted from memory, or based on light&mdash;but, in the end, who better than an artist to innovate through struggle? Krasner painted until she couldn’t anymore, and after that, she spent time in the company of her works, communing with her creativity in a new way. In an essay by Patricia Utermohlen on her late husband’s final works, she wrote that William Utermohlen’s self-portraits&mdash;arresting portrayals of his descent into dementia&mdash;were a way of addressing his fears and exploring his altered self, and that this necessitated a new form, new tools, even a new style. “The great talent remains,” she wrote. “But the method changes.”</p>
<p>At eighty-five, Georgia O’Keeffe’s eyesight began to dim, and she was unable to continue painting. Her last unassisted oil painting, <em>The Beyond</em>, was completed in 1972 and described by her biographer Hunter Drohojowska-Philp as “portentous and tragic&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;O’Keeffe’s view of her immediate future.” </p>
<p><em>The Beyond</em>’s foreground was dark and finite, but the horizon line and azure sky were infinite and promising. It was light-filled, limitless. Or maybe there was no message within this work, just our competing interpretations, our need to see something past the canvas, on the horizon, so mysteriously and beautifully captured by O’Keeffe’s hand. It was darker than her similar reductionist paintings of the previous decade but rich in its darkness and hinting at its artistic precursors. Had O’Keeffe known this would be her final unassisted painting? Struggling with her vision, she likely knew some change was afoot. But do we ever really know when we do anything for the last time?</p>
<p>I no longer sing lullabies to my daughter, and neither of us remembers when we stopped the ritual. Grasping back into my memory, I’m at a loss to find the end point, the finale of that important life stage. Why did I stop? The answer, of course, is that life is progress. What I know is that we began reading novels together before bed, every night, no matter how late it was, no matter where we were. It was an extension of the earlier time, and it was equally precious. O’Keeffe moved from painting to sculpture&mdash;giving us works like <em>Abstraction</em>, a twelve-foot structure of clean lines and fiddlehead curves. In a photograph taken by Bruce Weber in 1984, the artist posed with her sculpture. She wore a broad-brimmed hat that circled her head like a dark halo. She was old, her skin papery and thin, and the way she held her body was both angular and austere. She leaned on a curve of her sculpture, an elegant long hand laid purposefully across her lap. Limitation necessarily inspires. Psychologist Robert Kastenbaum, whose scholarly work on death and dying redefined what we know about this stage of life, has written that creativity “may be the aging individual’s most profound response to the limits and uncertainties of existence.” Facing resistance&mdash;a stone wall, an impassable rush of water, a jagged-edged cliff&mdash;it is human nature to invent new pathways: a tunnel, a boat, a bridge. The most creative among us find their way, as O’Keeffe found hers.</p>
<p>We interpret the artist by looking at her work, but our inferences are more a mirror of ourselves. <em>The Beyond</em> was construed by many as meaningful for its place in the artist’s oeuvre, its title a tragic nod to her end. But this is ageist and ableist, and O’Keeffe didn’t stop there. After switching mediums, she continued creating work for another fourteen years. Maybe the title hinted at a new frontier&mdash;one waiting to be conquered and mastered, just past the dark horizon.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Inside a new housing model for managing mental decline&mdash;one that prioritizes patient autonomy]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1392" height="1191" src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/FOB_Olafson_MAY20_Art-01.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="Illustration of a doctor opening the door of a hospital so an elderly woman, pulling a suitcase, can walk outside. Beyond the door is a brightly-coloured village." loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="" /><p><span class="dropcap">P</span><span class="smallcaps">eter Moody</span> always starts his day with a cup of coffee. He then laces up his white Reeboks and heads out the front door for a run. Moody might jog past his neighbour, Bob Beauchamp, walking his black-and-white dog, Lucy. He might pass another resident on their way to buy a few groceries or others sitting on a bench in front of their cottages, enjoying the sunshine. Later in the day, Moody might visit the community centre to listen to music or watch a movie. Or he might go on another jog.</p>
<p>It’s an unremarkable scene, really, except that each of the community’s forty-five current residents lives with some form of dementia: the syndrome where memory and the ability to perform everyday activities progressively deteriorate. The Village, located in Langley, BC, opened its doors last August, making it the first dementia-care facility in Canada that does not identify as a hospital or a care home but a whole town. There’s the community centre, which houses a general store and a hair salon. Residents live in six single-storey cottages, each painted a different colour, with white picket fences. There’s a well-tended communal garden. Tall evergreen trees line the Village’s picturesque perimeter, as does a two-and-a-half-metre-tall fence, built so residents can wander the grounds independently without straying too far from staff.</p>
<p>Dementia has no known cure. Alzheimer’s disease is its most well-known and common form, although it isn’t the only one: vascular dementia and Lewy body dementia are others. Whatever the type, over time, dementia’s progressive nature will affect an individual’s ability to live independently. They might forget how to use everyday objects, such as cutlery or a toothbrush, or they might forget which groceries need to be refrigerated. Maybe they can’t remember whether they’ve taken their medication or the steps to take when showering. Eventually, dementia could also affect the individual’s safety: they might forget to turn off the stove or put on a coat in the winter, or they might get lost while walking in familiar areas. That’s when a care home could be needed&mdash;a place where individuals with dementia often live full-time and where staff assist with everyday tasks.</p>

<p>The Village, however, is a far cry from the care homes and dementia units that Karen Tyrell worked at for more than twenty years in Ontario and BC. They looked like hospitals and felt cold and hostile. Mostly, she remembers the locked doors. One afternoon in particular stands out: she had finished her shift and was leaving the facility. The residents saw her walk through the unit’s doors, which clicked shut behind her. Through the window that looked out beyond their unit, they watched her walk away. Behind her, Tyrell heard the residents banging on the locked doors, asking Tyrell to take them with her, begging her not to leave them.</p>
<p>“People with dementia are still human,” she says. “And that way of housing those people just felt so wrong.” These days, Tyrell runs her own Vancouver-based business, Personalized Dementia Solutions, working as a dementia-care consultant and sharing care techniques to minimize the negative behaviours common to those with dementia, like anxiety, agitation, and aggression. In her book <em>Cracking the Dementia Code: Creative Solutions to Cope with Changed Behaviours</em>, Tyrell explains that fear, confusion, and the sense of being trapped can drive aggression as well as the panic and anxiety she saw in that locked dementia unit. Conversely, to minimize those emotions, she adds, caretakers must prioritize a person’s autonomy, individuality, and freedom. It may seem simple, but when it comes to dementia care, it could also be revolutionary.</p>
<p>Between 2002 and 2013, the number of Canadian seniors living with dementia increased by 83 percent, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information. In 2016, the Alzheimer Society of Canada estimated that more than half a million Canadians were living with dementia and projected that this number would rise by 66 percent by 2031. There is a clear need to consider how to care for this growing population in a way that is both compassionate and effective. Already, other care facilities similar in concept to the Village are beginning to pop up, with communities currently being developed in Vancouver and Comox, BC. All of them are working to answer an urgent question: Could a place where someone has the freedom to live their day as they choose, move around as they like, and walk outside whenever they please be a model for the future of dementia care?</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">E</span><span class="smallcaps">lroy Jespersen</span> sits on a yellow couch in one of the Village’s sunrooms, a beam of light streaming in. Jespersen helped found the Village. Before turning to this project, he worked in the senior-care industry for thirty years in cities across Canada. In a wavering voice, he explains one of his motivations for the project: in 2014, his wife’s aunt began showing symptoms of dementia and was placed in a care home. There, she often left the facility and sometimes got lost while walking around West Vancouver. Her dementia progressed, she continued her walks, and she continued to get lost. She went from freely walking kilometres each day to no longer being able to do so safely. Jespersen felt that he couldn’t provide her with what she needed most: a sense of self.</p>
<p>He considered the possibility of a better way of care. First, he turned to the US nursing-home culture-change movement, which pushes for traditional institutional models to be replaced with environments that look, feel, and operate like actual homes. The movement, which has been gaining ground since the late 1990s, advocates for better quality of life and care that goes beyond a person’s basic physical needs to also consider their identity, their values, and their interests. The movement stresses the importance of autonomy, meaningful activities, and close social interactions&mdash;all things that make anybody’s life, no matter their age, worth living. For seniors, particularly those with dementia, such factors can be especially crucial.</p>
<p>American geriatrician Bill Thomas came to such a conclusion when he first accepted a job in a care home, in the early 1990s. There, he witnessed what he describes as endemic loneliness, helplessness, and boredom among residents. He now calls these feelings “the three plagues.” Instead, he sought to foster an understanding of well-being that included autonomy, connectedness, and a resident’s source of joy and identity&mdash;whether they enjoyed walking, baking, or gardening. Thomas’s philosophy challenges that of traditional care homes, where care is often centred exclusively on mitigating physical decline. For Thomas, good dementia care&mdash;as well as good care for seniors without dementia&mdash;is about ensuring the whole person is nurtured so they can continue to live a meaningful life.</p>
<p>In 1994, Thomas co-created the Eden Alternative, an international nonprofit that works with seniors’ organizations to help them implement a holistic approach&mdash;one that focuses on eradicating the three plagues. Recent data collected by the Eden Alternative found that the populations of American care homes that switched to this approach required 26 percent less antipsychotic medication within the first year. Another study found an 18 percent decrease in the use of restraints at Texas-based homes that used the approach. And one Kentucky-based organization found the communities that embraced the Eden Alternative approach saw a reduction in falls, weight loss, nurse turnover, and antipsychotic medication.</p>
<p>The Village doesn’t adhere to one care model. Jespersen also borrowed from other approaches around the world, including De Hogeweyk in the town of Weesp, in the Netherlands, and the Green House Project in the US. Both are community-like care homes that prioritize residents’ freedom of movement, and each also offers homey environments instead of institutional ones, providing residents with autonomy. For Jespersen, the result is a unique combination of existing best practices meant to focus on a person’s remaining abilities, not on their decline.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">drienne Alford-Burt</span>, the executive director at the Village, recalls one late evening at work. Before heading home, she stopped by one of the cottages, knocked, and waited to be invited inside. She remembers the smell of fresh baking filling the air. The residents, she says, had decided to host a high tea the next day and, with the help of a staff member, were busily preparing homemade pastries, egg tarts, and cookies. For Alford-Burt, this is just one example of what makes the Village different. “A misconception about people living with dementia is that they can’t learn or can’t be productive,” she says, adding that, in her experience, “in a traditional setting, you’ll see baking listed on the recreational activities board, and a group of residents sit around and watch the staff do the work.” But not at the Village.</p>
<p>Alford-Burt argues that business-as-usual methods will not meet the growing demand for dementia care, and she worries people will be warehoused in institutional facilities. So do federal policy makers. Last June, the government of Canada released its first national dementia strategy, which was created to influence how the country approaches the expected dementia boom. The strategy explicitly outlines a need to focus on dementia care that is holistic and respectful of individuals’ dignity, and it acknowledges that, currently, there is a lack of both access to and awareness of such care. It also warns that, considering Canada’s aging population, access to good dementia care will only become more challenging, and the availability of good care could decline if changes aren’t made to meet future demand.</p>
<p>Jespersen and Alford-Burt both see what they’ve created as a starting point, not the end solution, when it comes to supporting Canadians living with dementia. For one, the Village can be a challenging template to follow. It sits on 2.8 hectares of land, and this property’s availability, area, and location were pure luck. Jespersen happened upon an ad selling a former elementary school site in 2016. That much space is hard to come by in urban centres, and real estate costs can be prohibitive. So, too, can patient costs. Monthly fees for the Village range from $7,300 to $8,300, an all-inclusive rate Alford-Burt says is consistent with the industry average. Still, because the Village is a private care facility, there are no government subsidies available. Residents must pay 100 percent of the fees out of pocket, hindering equal access.</p>
<p>But, even if replication is difficult, both Jespersen and Alford-Burt want the Village to inspire others providing dementia care. Those unable to build new structures or renovate existing ones could work to shift culture, for instance, by focusing on giving residents the freedom to live on their own terms. Even incorporating more colour by painting over the institutional whites and greys or hanging artwork on the walls, suggest Jespersen and Alford-Burt, would be a step in the right direction. “I hope to see the day when we don’t need dementia villages, but that’s not today,” Jespersen says. “There needs to be change, both with the design of our cities and in society as a whole. But, until that happens, this is a whole lot better than the options out there.”	</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/dementia-care-gets-its-own-village/">Dementia Care Gets Its Own Village</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

She was proud to be in her own space and host friends and family. “Home is home” is how her youngest son, Chris Jarvis, explained it. Jarvis often travelled, but he would stop in to stay with his mother whenever he could. As Shaw got older and her health waned, another son moved in with her. This arrangement worked well until Christmastime in 2010. According to Jarvis, as the holidays approached, Shaw didn’t seem herself: she was anxious and confused&mdash;“just acting strange.” The family took her to the hospital.</p>

<p>After Shaw was admitted, hospital staff decided to give her a capacity assessment: a common evaluation administered to people who seem disoriented. In many cases, these people are seniors. The goal of these assessments is to determine whether a person has the ability to understand information and foresee the consequences of their actions or decisions. Subjects are asked questions like, “What is today’s date?” and “What problems are you having right now?” They may be asked about how they’d react to various scenarios: “What would you do if you had a fall at home?” or “What if there was a fire?” And, though these assessments are often given by doctors, the responses lead to a legal outcome rather than a medical diagnosis. If the assessor determines that a person is incapable of making some or all of their own decisions, a “certificate of incapability” can then be issued. These certificates have different names depending on the province, but they all have more or less the same result: from that moment on, some or all of a person’s autonomy may be taken away for good. </p>

</ul>
<p>Being deemed incapable means that a person’s life decisions&mdash;what they spend their money on, what health care they receive, where they call home&mdash;may be delegated to a trusted party. In some cases, that proxy is a family member; in others, it is the provincial public-guardian system, whose staff may meet with the person rarely, if ever. The system is designed to protect against elder abuse and errors in judgment; it is an attempt to safeguard some of society’s most vulnerable, but it risks doing so at the cost of their liberties.</p>
<p>After her capacity assessment, Shaw was deemed incapable. (Jarvis said that she was showing symptoms consistent with early-stage dementia.) The people around her immediately began trying to work out who would make decisions on her behalf. She had three children, and they had different ideas about what would be best for her. Jarvis said that social workers and hospital staff determined there was no suitable place for Shaw to live among her family, and though she wanted to remain at home, her care workers wouldn’t allow it.</p>
<p>After months in the transitional-care unit of a hospital, Shaw was moved to a long-term care facility. She started writing in a new journal there, in June 2011. She seemed to want to make the best of her situation, and on the first page, she put down a rosy title for her project: “New Beginning!” But her entries outlined a growing list of concerns: “My small room lets me see outside, food is available etc, but I am still very sad and lonely,” she wrote. “Wish I could be home rather than in the hospital (or whatever this place is called!).”</p>
<p>While Shaw was getting acclimatized to her new living situation, Jarvis and his siblings argued over how their mother’s money was being managed. To settle the matter, BC’s Public Guardian and Trustee (<span class="smallcaps">PGT</span>) became involved. The BC <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span> is a government-designated corporation that steps in when there isn’t a family member or close friend available to take responsibility for a person deemed incapable. “If we’d had money and family harmony, this would not have happened,” Jarvis said. “It wasn’t ideal, but what was the alternative?” It was a development that would consume the next ten years of his life.</p>
<p>Shaw is not alone in spending her older years deemed incapable and living under the oversight of the <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span>. In Alberta and BC respectively, public guardians reported 7,832 and 7,904 adult clients from 2017 to 2018. The Public Guardian in Ontario managed the finances of approximately 12,500 people in 2019, about half of whom were seniors. Billions of dollars&mdash;savings accounts, assets, pensions&mdash;are managed by public guardians across the country.</p>
<p>But, in recent years, auditors general and ombudspersons have raised concerns about the inner workings of the closely entwined capacity-assessment and public-guardian systems. In our countrywide patchwork of well-intentioned bureaucracies, some seniors find that, once declared incapable, they are unable to challenge the decision. There has been case after case of mismanaged finances and contested spending. In Ontario, the auditor general found that over $1 million of assets managed by the <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span> was lost between 2015 and 2018 because of staff mistakes. In one instance, a packet containing nearly $650 worth of jewellery was found in a <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span> office, and employees had no idea which client it belonged to. Errors like this are not confined to one province: reviewers in <span class="smallcaps">PEI</span>, BC, Alberta, and New Brunswick have all stated that their public trustees may not be properly protecting or administering their clients’ finances.</p>
<p>It can seem like a great deal of attention is paid to other institutions that house vulnerable segments of the population, such as children in daycares. But there’s no future in aging; there is next to no potential that a senior might one day cure cancer or be the next prime minister. Reform in elder care may be desperately needed, but it hasn’t been forthcoming.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/FEA_Riley_APR20_Art-02_web2.png" alt="Illustration of a small bird sitting in a pair of hands, which are loosely cupped around it.

<p><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smallcaps">etermining</span> mental capacity can be a puzzle. To test for a fever, medical staff can take a person’s temperature; for diabetes, they can do a blood test. Capacity, on the other hand, has no standard unit of measurement. Trying to determine whether a person is able to make their own decisions can be subjective and debatable. Sometimes, the practice may seem more like an art than a science.</p>
<p>In Canada, there is no universal assessment or standardized system to determine capacity. Depending on the province or territory, capacity assessments can be administered by a doctor or a nurse, a social worker or a psychologist, an occupational therapist or, in rare cases, a member of the clergy.</p>
<p>Some assessors may use what’s known as a Mini–Mental State Examination. In this evaluation, seniors are asked the month and the season. They are asked to spell “world” backward and forward and given a time limit of thirty seconds. They are asked what province they’re in, to repeat the phrase “no ifs, ands, or buts,” and to fold a piece of paper in half and put it on their lap or the floor. Other assessors may use the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, in which the subject is asked to draw a clock face and to name as many words that begin with the letter <em>f</em> as they can in one minute. Other patients may be assessed on a geriatric-depression scale, where they are asked if they feel “pretty worthless” or if “it is wonderful to be alive.” </p>
<p>Being on the receiving end of these questions can be rattling&mdash;but not answering to the assessor’s satisfaction can influence whether a person goes home at the end of the meeting. And, though these cognitive tests can offer clues about a person’s abilities, experts are raising concerns about the efficacy of these tools and caution that assessors may be overrelying on them. Laura Tamblyn Watts, president and <span class="smallcaps">CEO</span> of the seniors’ advocacy group CanAge, says that capacity should be thought of as more like a dial: “People are more and less capable of doing some things and not others.” As she explains, many of us experience some level of uncertainty in our day-to-day lives; we all get confused and ask ourselves questions like, <em>Did I pay that bill already? Did I turn off the oven before I left home? </em>But determining when exactly these sorts of questions become a sign that some greater function has been lost is far from straightforward. Even those with dementia don’t fully lose their faculties overnight. </p>
<p>Capacity often comes in fits and spurts and can be influenced by health and environment. Problems with sleep or blood sugar, as well as common illnesses like urinary tract infections, can temporarily affect a person’s state of mind. Seniors with dementia may experience a phenomenon known as sundowning, a decline in function that occurs later in the day. And then there are the medications. “There is a massive overdrugging of seniors in long-term care,” Tamblyn Watts says. According to the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement, one in five people in long-term care is administered antipsychotic drugs despite not having any diagnosis of psychosis. These drugs can increase fatigue and confusion and are known in the industry as “chemical restraints.”</p>
<p>Maria Zorzitto, head of the geriatrics division at St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, explains that there is often a desire to see capacity as “black or white.” But, in reality, Zorzitto says, “there’s quite a grey spectrum here.” How a person performs on a capacity assessment can be influenced by whether they’ve recently experienced a traumatic event, whether they trust their assessor, or whether they are hard of hearing. Some senior advocates argue that people may even be found incapable without being properly assessed by a doctor at all. Ruth Adria, a retired registered nurse in Edmonton, says that she believes this was the case when a woman she knew&mdash;I’ll call her Martha&mdash;was deemed incapable over ten years ago.</p>
<p>As Adria tells it, Martha was eighty-five and lived alone in her bungalow. She kept busy, filling her days with errands, tending to her backyard garden, and regularly stocking her basement with jars of homemade preserves. Martha had grown up an orphan in Europe and was well acquainted with looking out for herself.</p>
<p>Then, one day, she hurt her foot and was admitted to her local hospital. Adria says that, while Martha was there, health care workers raised concerns about her living conditions. Martha never went home again. She lost control of her finances and was placed in a nursing home. According to documents that Adria saved, Martha’s bank account was billed $2,000 per month for her new room&mdash;a shared space in which only a curtain separated her from other residents. Martha’s house was emptied, her preserves tossed into a dumpster.</p>
<p>Throughout the ordeal, Martha maintained that she was being unfairly “locked up,” according to a letter she wrote to her doctor that Adria kept. Martha knew what was happening: she complained that she wasn’t allowed to attend Mass, that her only exercise was “walking the corridor aimlessly,” and she argued she would be better off at home. “I want my freedom!” she wrote. “I want out of this place!” She never did get out.</p>
<p>With so many complicating factors that can influence capacity, and with a person’s rights on the line, public watchdogs have continued voicing concerns about the quality of assessments. Adria now advocates for capacity assessments to be recorded and transcribed so families can have access to the basis of their family member’s certificate of incapability. As it stands, many written assessments are vague, with little information about how conclusions were reached.</p>
<p>Registered nurse Alanna Kaye is well versed in the complexities of capacity assessments. When she first trained to become an assessor in Ontario, twenty-five years ago, it was a week-long intensive course, complete with role-playing and exams. Now, the training lasts three days&mdash;a length that could be seen as insufficient. “Because this is complex, the more practice you get, the better,” she says. </p>
<p>In 2018, Ontario’s auditor general found that outside experts “identified concerns in almost half of the assessors they evaluated.” They cited a “lack of understanding of relevant legislation; asking subjects questions that lacked sufficient depth; not explaining why they found the subject incapable; and not meeting any of the requirements for completing an assessment.” The auditor concluded, “There is risk that the Public Guardian is assuming authority for managing the finances of people who are in fact capable of doing it themselves.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t’s not hard</span> to imagine why a person deemed incapable may want to dispute the decision. But a person’s options for challenging a certificate of incapability and the <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span>’s involvement depends on what province they call home. The most-referenced example of a gold standard, Ontario’s Consent and Capacity Board, was created in 1996 but remains a rarity in Canada&mdash;a similar body exists only in the Yukon. </p>
<p>If a person objects to a capacity decision in Ontario, the board will convene within seven days. Application forms are available online, or a person can call a toll-free number for help. There is no cost for a hearing. Importantly, the board’s panel will go to the person challenging the decision&mdash;according to Lora Patton, vice-chair of the board, it has met in hospitals, libraries, and nursing homes.</p>
<p>One hearing concerned a sixty-nine-year-old man. Bob (not his real name) was given a capacity assessment in 2012, after his landlord complained to a social worker that he had stopped paying rent. The assessor, with scant knowledge of Bob’s medical, financial, or personal history, met him in a Tim Hortons one evening and noted that he was “vague” in his responses to her questions. The assessor said Bob failed to accurately count some coins she gave him&mdash;she had asked him to count them under the table, as she thought it uncouth to count money in the open. After the brief meeting, the assessor unilaterally decided that Bob was incapable of handling his finances. They would be taken over by the Ontario <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span>.</p>
<p>The full story came out only at the hearing. Alex Procope, a Toronto lawyer who represented Bob and specializes in capacity, guardianship, and power of attorney, told me Bob had stopped paying his rent in protest&mdash;his landlord was failing to address a cockroach infestation in his apartment. Procope has represented hundreds of clients before the Consent and Capacity Board and says situations like this are more common for capacity rulings concerning property. “[Landlords] will try to get the <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span> [involved] because they think they’ll have an easier time getting their rent,” he says. </p>
<p>The assessor later admitted her testing was influenced by the sense that she was on “a rescue mission” to prevent Bob from being evicted and that the <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span> would help him straighten out his finances. The board deemed Bob capable, noting that the assessor “may have had the best of intentions” but that, in her short meeting with Bob, she had “made a number of assumptions that were proven erroneous.” Bob was lucky: he regained control over his bank account and his life.</p>
<p>Another Ontario case involved a ninety-five-year-old widow who lived alone and was prone to falls. In 2014, a nurse she had never met conducted a forty-minute interview and, as part of the questioning, asked what would happen to the woman if she stayed at home. The ninety-five-year-old responded, “I guess I will just live ’till I die”&mdash;an accurate, if blunt, statement. The nurse deemed the woman incapable of deciding where she should live. The Consent and Capacity Board later found the opposite to be true.</p>
<p>According to Ontario’s auditor general, the board has come to a different conclusion than the original assessor in 80 percent of cases it has heard concerning people’s ability to manage their own finances. In British Columbia, as in many other provinces, there is no such tribunal to review an assessor’s conclusions. In a 2013 report, the province’s ombudsperson noted that, in most cases, a person issued a certificate of incapability has only two options: they can request a reassessment at their own cost, or they can put up an expensive fight in court. The BC ombudsperson urged the Ministry of Justice to set up an independent tribunal for appeals, though it has not yet done so.</p>
<p>These institutions are not something every senior will encounter. <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span> involvement in particular can be more likely for people who lack willing caregivers, those without prior written plans, or those with families who are in disagreement. Muriel Shaw fit into the latter two categories.</p>
<p>When Shaw first moved into her nursing home, she received statements from the <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span> listing her monthly income: her work pension and old-age security. The <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span> also noted the fees it was deducting, which in BC is 4 percent of a person’s annual income plus a percentage of their pension. (The <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span> can also deem it necessary to sell a person’s home and will collect 4 percent of the sale price.)</p>
<p>But Jarvis said that, as time went on, his mother’s financial statements stopped arriving. Shaw’s notebook contains an ever-growing list of items she wanted to buy&mdash;Band-Aids, a flashlight, brown socks&mdash;and a desire to figure out her finances. “Find out amount in bank,” she wrote. “What do I own?” Jarvis said that the lack of communication frustrated and confused his mother. “She lost control of her sovereignty by not having control of her own money. It made her angry,” Jarvis said. (The <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span> told me that it doesn’t comment on specific cases but added that, “if assets are secure and the adult is able,” it will try to minimize its involvement in day-to-day decisions like shopping and entertainment.)</p>
<p>The lack of communication made Jarvis angry too. He spent years trying to explain his and his mother’s concerns to the <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span> and described a Kafkaesque struggle with a faceless bureaucracy featuring frequently changing staff members and a long list of unanswered questions, unilateral decisions, and refusals to grant even the simplest expenditures. The <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span> used Shaw’s money to buy her a wheelchair, but Jarvis argued that they didn’t research the most cost-effective model. He said that a <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span> representative would visit his mother once a year, but in his opinion, that was not enough time for them to understand her situation. Jarvis wanted out of the arrangement, but he felt there was no way for the family to take back control of his mother’s finances without getting mixed up in an expensive legal battle.</p>
<p>Jarvis told me that, throughout the experience, no one in his family was properly consulted about what might be best for his mother. Nor, for that matter, was she. As time progressed and Shaw’s health deteriorated, her notebook entries appeared to reflect this. The pages were punctuated with scribbles and rips, and it’s evident that she often became confused. “What day is it today?” she asked in one entry. “I am mixed up as usual.” But even so, her unhappiness with the situation was clear: “I am sad to have reached the end of my life like this.”</p>
<p>Situations like that of Jarvis and Shaw are not isolated incidents. I met with Kris Schmuland at a coffee shop in Vancouver. His mother, Mary Rose, had been living in a nursing home when she was deemed incapable and her finances turned over to the <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span>. He said that, once the <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span> became involved, he had to go through a tedious process of seeking permission to help his mother buy herself items&mdash;lotions, clothing, supplements&mdash;and these requests were often turned down. Mary Rose had suffered a stroke and was not able to speak, but Schmuland spent a long time believing that his mother was still capable of making her own decisions. Even so, he had no means to appeal Mary Rose’s assessment. “Battling a legal team of the best lawyers in the province?” he asked. “I don’t have money like that.”</p>
<p>Schmuland would often bus or hitchhike to visit Mary Rose at the care homes she was placed in across the Lower Mainland. He wanted his mother to spend the last of her money on her own comforts. The Christmas he knew would be her last, he went all out. He bought a Christmas train and strung paper snowflakes from dental floss in front of her window. “There were lights and elves and stuff hanging everywhere,” he told me, near tears. He wanted to “make sure her life was as pleasant and as beautiful as possible until she passed away.” The <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span>, he said, didn’t make that easy.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n my conversations</span> with doctors and lawyers over the course of two years, one word came up repeatedly: “paternalism.” When the state or a family member is given the power to make decisions on another’s behalf, they inevitably run the risk of substituting their own values for those of their charge. “It’s a fundamental right to protect a person’s autonomy,” says Kim Whaley, a trusts and estates lawyer in Toronto, “but you also want to balance that against whether a person is vulnerable and needs protection. It’s a fine balance.”</p>
<p>Jarvis told me a story that seems indicative of this conflict. When his mother was living on a fixed income, she discovered that her poodle was dying. She spent around $700 on veterinary bills, though her dog’s life was prolonged only a few days. Was Shaw’s spending a foolish decision that ought to have been prevented for her own sake? Did she understand the consequences? These are the questions a capacity assessment tries to answer, but whether there <em>is</em> a correct answer is up for debate.</p>
<p>Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics for Sinai Health System and the University Health Network in Toronto, says that, for doctors, the desire to protect a patient can be overwhelming and can sometimes lead to overreach. “You pledge to do no harm,” he says. “It’s so deeply ingrained.” Still, he’s concerned that ageism can affect decisions: “People are more likely to infantilize older people. Just because they’re old doesn’t mean they’ve lost their right to make those decisions.” After all, people have the right to make mistakes, spend frivolously, and live in less than stellar conditions&mdash;this includes all manner of hoarders and misfits. </p>
<p>But even so, many would agree there comes a time when the state must intervene to protect a person. “In some instances,” Whaley says, “I say we’re not paternalistic enough.” Through her decades of practice, she’s seen countless instances of elder abuse&mdash;horrible cases where a person’s health care is neglected or their bank accounts are drained by family members or scammers. According to the National Survey on the Mistreatment of Older Canadians, nearly 250,000 seniors were victims of financial abuse in 2015, and millions of dollars have been lost to scams or fraud. Do we not have an obligation as a society, Whaley wonders, to be aware and assist when a person is vulnerable?</p>
<p>These ethical questions are becoming more pressing. It is projected that there will be more seniors in Canada than children by next year, and the population of people over eighty is set to double by 2036. It’s estimated that more than 1.5 million Canadians are now well past the average age of mortality, and as such, they have likely outlived most of their friends, colleagues, and siblings. Many have moved beyond their sunny retirements into the final phase of their lives. As part of their care, many will be pushed toward nursing homes, regardless of their own preferences. “The biggest indignity faced by many older people is losing the right to live independently in their home,” says Marshall Swadron, a Toronto lawyer who, for over thirty years, has represented clients whom he describes as “allegedly incapable.” “Some people are very proud of their homes, their independence, their ability to decide who comes in and who doesn’t&mdash;all of which you lose when you’re in any kind of institutional setting.”</p>
<p>In BC, the Office of the Seniors Advocate surveyed nursing-home residents and found that nearly half don’t want to be there. About the same amount say they don’t have any close friends in the facility. At some point, as one advocate told me, many seniors in nursing homes end up looking “like flowers with drooping heads.”</p>
<p>But, as Sinha points out, the system that’s been created to protect seniors can also work to support them&mdash;to see them as individuals with their own preferences and desires. He tells me a story about Josephine, a patient he got to know well. Josephine was blind and bedridden, and doctors wanted to place her in a nursing home&mdash;a decision she vehemently opposed. Some assessors may have seen Josephine as a woman incapable of deciding what was in her best interest. But, in this case, she kept her autonomy. Josephine stayed in her apartment and received government-funded visits from caregivers. She would lie in bed for most of the day and listen to her radio. To some, it may have appeared to be an awful way to live. To Josephine, it was the best life possible.</p>
<p>Advocate Laura Tamblyn Watts points to examples like this as evidence that a more supportive model is possible, one that doesn’t strip a person of their decision-making ability. “We always want to make sure that we are only removing the civil rights of the person to the smallest degree that need be,” she says. Lately, some advocates have been promoting a “supported decision-making model” where seniors receive help understanding the consequences of their decisions and come to solutions alongside a team. The process is collaborative; it doesn’t rely on someone making decisions on the senior’s behalf. This kind of process takes time, training, and trust, and not all seniors today have trustworthy advocates willing to work with them on such a level. Despite the challenges involved, Tamblyn Watts says the goal should always be to ensure that each senior’s personhood is respected for as long as possible.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he end </span>of all our stories is the same: we die. But how we spend our final years matters. I first met Jarvis long after his mother was admitted to long-term care. Shaw’s “new beginning” was over, and her health had continued to wane. She was on multiple medications, and her mind was often swarmed with fleeting thoughts that, like fireflies, dimmed and flitted away. Her notebook was long forgotten. </p>
<p>Jarvis told me he had one regret: that the <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span> had ever become involved in his family’s affairs. He felt that, rather than relieving the stress that age and illness brought to both his mother and his family, the <span class="smallcaps">PGT</span> had made her decline all the more painful. Through tears, he told me that he was planting sunflowers in a window-box at his mother’s nursing home. He planned to use them at her funeral.</p>
<p>Muriel Shaw died last January. I met with Jarvis a few weeks afterward, at his home in Coquitlam. Her funeral had yet to be arranged, and her family members were trying to find a way to gather. I asked about the flowers in the window, and Jarvis told me they wouldn’t be making it to her funeral after all. “I let the sunflowers die,” he said. It was near the end of the season, he concluded. And besides, they didn’t get the care and attention they needed.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/why-arent-we-free-to-age-on-our-own-terms/">When Is a Senior No Longer Capable of Making Their Own Decisions?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>
