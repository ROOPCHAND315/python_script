You&#8217;ll find the rest of our selections <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/20th-anniversary/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p><em>This story, about a kidnapping, is told on a tightrope, striking a delicious balance between horror and humour. Kathryn Kuitenbrouwer told me it “came burbling out” of her after overhearing a girl shriek about how cute the children in a passing horse-driven buggy were. “I want to steal one!” the girl exclaimed. Kuitenbrouwer went into the writing aware  of her ignorance about the Amish; she had fewer qualms satirizing the parents of children at a private alternative school, of whom she was one at the time. At its best, short fiction drops readers into an unknown and often absurd situation mid-action, dazzles them with bright and shiny prose, and leaves them mulling over what happened, both on the page and in their minds, for days and weeks and years afterward. This story does all of that.&mdash;Dafna Izenberg, features editor, November 2023 issue</em></p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t took the class</span> some doing to ambush, tackle, and finally capture the boy. They hid themselves on a stretch of the 62 just north of Ivanhoe and waited, giggling and getting grossed out when Markus let a fluffy. They’d done their best to work it all out in advance, but no one had properly committed to any one aspect of the job. Their approach was puerile. It was all just “We’ll stop the carriage, distract the driver, and someone will grab one of the littlies&mdash;oh my God, they are so cute.”</p>
<p>The fart hovered at nose level as the nostalgic clop of horses sounded and a decision became necessary. There was a great deal of wide-eyed buck passing until Becky said, “Screw this and screw you guys,” and threw herself up out of the ditch, tumbling almost acrobatically to stand right in the way of the two horses trotting up the highway. Becky held a short willow branch she had picked up along the way. She faced the oncoming Amish buggy and stretched out her arms. There were certain children left in the ditch wishing they had taken this initiative, energized by her raw courage.</p>
<p>The buggy driver pulled up with a “Ho!” as the horses shortened their trot and stopped, hoofing the dirt right where Becky stood.</p>

</ul>
<p>Myra shimmied along the ditch toward the back of the carriage. The others followed. Behind the bearded man was a little boy, dressed identically to him, in a wee blue shirt and a wee straw hat. Myra whispered, “My pet! Oh, isn’t he darling?”</p>
<p>Becky waved her hands to distract the man. “Excuse me, sir,” she said.</p>
<p>The man cocked his head and ­waited. He seemed amused, as if regular people were strange and delightful simply ­because he could not predict them. He was unlike anyone Becky had ever seen. His shirt was not crisp and clean but mud or (oh, my) manure splattered, and it was fastened with safety pins. Was it possible that this man’s wife was a bad ­domestic, despite being loved in the eyes of God?</p>
<p>Becky tried to keep the man’s attention so the class could gain time. They were about to edge around the side of the buggy, where the little boy sat watching her, enrapt, she supposed, by her pink legs, denim cut-offs, and cherry-red tank top.</p>
<p>“How many Amish . . . ?” Becky asked earnestly (and here she raised the willow switch, noting at the same time that the class almost had their hands upon the boy). “How many Amish, sir, does it take to screw in a light bulb?”</p>
<p>William’s palm covered the boy’s mouth as the girls yanked the child out of his seat and surrounded him. It was as quiet as such a thing could be, and ­before the man noticed the boy was missing, Becky brought the stick down on the nose of one of the horses. The man’s face went from curious to querulous. Perhaps he was wondering about the light bulb, or lining up that this was a joke, however bad, and that it was on him. She switched the horses again and again. The two beasts reared, shocked and then furious at the maltreatment. The man yelled, then whipped and cajoled the horses to move. This was better than perfect. He wanted to get away! Becky moved to the soft shoulder to watch the class pet and adore the boy while the black buggy receded into the distance. She marvelled at the great space opening up between these two things.</p>
<p>The child was much younger than they had realized. He had doughnuts of flesh under his knees and around his wrists that smelled faintly of milk and love.</p>
<p>“Let us call him Puppy,” said Myra.</p>
<p>William told her not to be stupid. “He is <em>the Amish</em>,” he said. “We decided this long ago.”</p>
<p>“The Amish,” Markus repeated and lifted his leg to toot.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">hey had snuck</span> from their tents this fine morning, before the spring dew dried on the grass, and come back with their prize. They were the grade six class of the city’s one true Waldorf school. Led by the lanky Erik McAuley&mdash;who for three years prior to his teacher training had followed a troop of Viking re-enactors around the fjords&mdash;the small, airtight class was camping this week at a farm owned by William’s parents. Mr. McAuley cocked his head thoughtfully. The boy was maybe four. “Where did you find him?”</p>
<p>“He was lying curled like a caterpillar on the side of the road,” Becky said. “It was more of a rescue.” She felt they had the story worked out.</p>
<p>“At first,” added Markus, “we thought it was a turtle. We were hoping for turtles.”</p>
<p>“But instead it was a boy?” said Mr. McAuley.</p>
<p>“An Amish,” corrected Myra. “We shall keep him as a class pet.”</p>
<p>Mr. McAuley’s eyebrows dropped over his eyes. The hairs were red and extravagant, even in so young a man. Several strays looped out from the pack, giving him a foxy look the children adored. “We cannot keep someone’s child,” he said.</p>
<p>“An abandoned child,” asserted William, and the other seven children, even the shyer ones, chimed in, almost shrieking, that they must keep the Amish. They must.</p>
<p>The Amish sat cross legged, picking blades of grass and gathering them into a bouquet in his plump hand. He held them to his face and blew at their tips, playing at being the wind and rustling them. Mr. McAuley and the children watched him crumple after a time and sink to sleep on the farmhouse lawn, a heap of blue cotton and baby flesh, the straw hat having slipped off his head in the process. It lay next to him, glowing round.</p>
<p>“Someone will surely miss him,” Mr. McAuley said. “You don’t just leave a child on the side of the road.”</p>
<p>“But that is exactly what we thought when we saw him,” said Becky. “And so we took him.” The last bit was the only true thing any of them had yet uttered.</p>
<p>The Amish was cherubic in sleep, the bouquet of grass clutched in his fist. The children looked back and forth, watching Mr. McAuley watch the boy and seeing his heart melt.</p>
<p>“What we should really do is call the police,” he said, but by the way he said it, the children knew he would not. Then, without conviction, he muttered, “The school won’t approve,” and the children rose up into a hurrah. A celebration ensued around the prone Amish. Spontaneously, the class held hands&mdash;and pulled Mr. McAuley to their cause&mdash;and formed into a fairy circle, dancing back and forth around the foundling, as they had already come to think of him. They sang a dirge-like song, a round, that sprang from the earth into their mouths.</p>
<p>They already loved him so.</p>
<p>They brought the Amish around the property when he woke, admonishing him about areas where he was not allowed&mdash;the ancient pop bottle mound under the ragged hedge that bordered the northern verge of the civilized part of the land, where the old limestone house sat, and also the pond, which had a sludgy, dangerous beach. They took him to the pioneer dump in the western field and held up blue and amber medicine jars, indicating the corroded metal lids and the menacing shards where things had broken, and waggling their index fingers to convey simple boundaries. The boy never spoke during all this time, and it was only by the way he moved his pretty mouth, and looked in wonder at them all, that they knew he was listening.</p>
<p>“The Amish people don’t speak English,” said Mr. McAuley.</p>
<p>“Mr. McAuley?” said William, by way of diverting the conversation. “It must be time to start lunch.” The children did not wish to learn anything about the Amish. They only wanted the feeling that seemed to come from him.</p>
<p>“Beans and wieners!” Mr. McAuley said and turned to march toward the house. “Who is on schedule to help?”</p>
<p>William and Myra scrambled after Mr. McAuley, chanting, “Beans and wieners! Beans and wieners!” They were already thinking of rhymes for this: “Makes you meaner, keeps you cleaner.”</p>
<p>William thrust his hips out on “wieners” and whispered, “Look, look,” to Myra, who did not get it.</p>
<p>Becky muttered how she hated wieners, and that is when the eyes of the Amish wildly lit up, and he said, “Wienerwienerwiener,” very quickly.</p>
<p>“Say it again,” said Becky. She hugged the Amish, delighted that he had finally spoken. “Say it again! Do you like wieners? Do you?” She peered into his eyes and shook him a little. The Amish smiled. “Wiener,” he said. He had a raspy voice, which served to shift Becky’s idea of what an angelic voice might really sound like, so that in the end, it gave her insights into a heaven she had never thought possible. “Wiener,” the Amish repeated.</p>
<p>Becky straightened his little hat. “The wieners,” she said, “are 100 percent organic. We also have a vegan option.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he Amish</span> pulled the wiener from the crease of the bun and wiped off the ketchup using the lawn.</p>
<p>Myra said, “What’s he doing?”</p>
<p>“Shh, we must observe,” said Mr. McAuley, taking on an air, pedagogically speaking, of loving compassion.</p>
<p>The class sat decorously around the now-cold campfire, having sung a blessing, closed eyes, and looked inward, and were trying for the sake of anthropology not to interfere in any way with the Amish’s experience. Clutching the tube of meat in his pudgy right hand, the Amish wandered around the class, taking bites.</p>
<p>When he finished the wiener, they gave him another, and this he kept tucked into his hand for the rest of the afternoon, so they had to wonder at the significance and whisper about it among themselves. When they asked Mr. McAuley, he nodded in a knowing way but would not answer.</p>
<p>The significance seemed to grow in the late afternoon when menacing weather cracked the sky open. Lightning and the approaching rain forced the children and Mr. McAuley to make haste with the tents, the sky tumultuous behind and around them. The foundling, his hot dog held aloft, scurried across the lawn while they dragged the sodden tents into the farmhouse, yelling joyfully. Becky first called, then sang to the Amish, holding the screen door open, until finally he ran in, his wiener frayed but intact. He was soaking wet.</p>
<p>Becky took her beach towel and rubbed him all over, carefully drying his eyes and trying to wick some of the moisture from his clothes. But when she accidentally patted him too brusquely and the hot dog broke in two, the Amish began to weep. The children nestled close to him, cooed, and watched him take bites&mdash;the pieces now tucked into both of his hands&mdash;first from one half, then the other. The storm continued. Myra stood to turn on a light as dusk fell, and that is when they learned that the house had lost power.</p>
<p>“Class,” said Mr. McAuley, “if things don’t improve by morning, we’ll head back to the city.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he poor weather</span> did not abate and the power did not return, so they packed everything into the van. The question of what to do with the Amish was circumvented when Myra reminded the class that her mother was a social welfare lawyer and would surely know how to go about adoption or fostering and generally managing the situation. Myra used the term “due processes,” which impressed all of them. She smiled at the Amish and told him not to worry, then herded him up into the back of the twelve-seater van. They had eaten muffins for breakfast&mdash;William’s nana had made them&mdash;and though the boy had taken just one small test bite, he had still managed to smear chocolate along his chin.</p>
<p>The ride was raucous, with the boys teaching the Amish how to curl his tongue in several different ways, how to pop his cheek, how to make wet fart sounds with the snap of his armpit over his cupped palm. They taught him the word “shit” and how to muffle it into a cough. The Amish pulled the skin under his eyes down with the first two fingers of one hand and shoved his nose up with the index of the other, and the children laughed. Somewhere west of Pickering, Mr. McAuley announced, “I have texted that we’re returning. You’ll be picked up at the school by your parents unless permission has been explicitly given that you may take city transit home. Becky will keep the Amish through the weekend.”</p>
<p>“Why should Becky get to keep him?”</p>
<p>“William’s got the bigger house,” asserted Markus.</p>
<p>“And a pool,” added William. “We’ve got this whale,” he said and turned to the boy. “You can float on it!” The Amish didn’t have a bathing suit, but William would have his parents stop at the Walmart. “Why does Becky always get what she wants?” said William. “It isn’t fair.”</p>
<p>Becky silenced the calls for fairness. “I sorted it out, is all.” She had, in fact, sat up at the front petitioning her parents for one and a half concerted hours. Her onslaught of text and voice messages had begun politely but ascended to whining and finally threats. Her parents were well aware that she would never throw herself from the Viaduct (and, anyway, the very sensible installation of a suicide veil had made this impossible), but the verve with which she argued marvelled them, and they buckled. It would be temporary, they said, and she agreed. Secretly, she knew they would fall in love with the Amish once they met him. Her father had always wanted a son.</p>
<p>“After the weekend,” said Mr. McAuley, “we’ll rotate taking care of him until we figure out what’s to be done,” and here he offered gratitude to Myra for the projected help her mother might offer. Then he added, “The school has agreed to this living history lesson only if we proceed with due diligence and follow the letter of the law.”</p>
<p>At the mention of the law, there was much shushing. They reached their hands back and petted the Amish and sang a round. Then, in the last half hour of the journey, they decided they would sew clothes such as he was used to wearing and mend his hat with straw when it required this. They would watch his diet while trying to ascertain what a more accurate one might be, wieners and . . . they did not know, but determined to find out. And for the rest&mdash;William’s pool, the cottage Myra’s family had inherited in Muskoka&mdash;these would clearly improve the boy’s lot.</p>
<p>“His new situation will evolve him,” said Becky, as if he were emerging from the swamps of the Paleozoic.</p>
<p>William scoffed and said, “We just can’t know, Becky.”</p>
<p>The van had the collective atmosphere of ten brooding preadolescents, their next moves grown fetid from waiting. It had become a holding tank for their futures&mdash;and the future of the Amish as they now imagined it. How they longed to arrive!</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smallcaps">ecky stood</span> on the front steps of the school, still and stoic, the Amish having wrapped his plump arm tight around her leg as the cars drove up and swallowed the other students. “There,” she said as her parents’ Beemer finally took the corner, slow and cool. Becky slid her palm along the boy’s cheek, watching as her father emerged glorious and elegant from the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>“Daughter!” Chuck Buckley said and clutched Becky in the briefest of greetings. “And this,” he added, “must be the foundling!”</p>
<p>“He’s very tired, Father,” said Becky.</p>
<p>She lifted the Amish and tucked him in the back seat. “I believe he needs a doughnut. And possibly a hot dog.”</p>
<p>“We are going home,” Chuck said as they pulled away from the school. “Your mother has been slaving in the kitchen all morning.”</p>
<p>“But she doesn’t know his dietary needs.”</p>
<p>“I believe she googled them.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">my Buckley pulled</span> the door open before her family even stepped out of the car. “Oh my God,” she said. “Hello!”</p>
<p>Becky held her hands out to the foundling and half pulled, half helped him down out of the car and into the laneway. He was sweaty and dirty. The Amish looked up at Chuck and said, “Father,” and Becky watched her dad’s heart chakra soften. The boy reached a hand up and tugged on the edge of Chuck’s summer wool sports jacket and smiled. Chuck moved around to the trunk, and the boy trailed behind.</p>
<p>“Mother, this is the Amish.” Becky gently moved the boy toward her mother, then leaned down to make eye contact with him. “This is Mother,” she said to him and pointed. “Mother.”</p>
<p>“Mother,” said the boy.</p>
<p>“His first words,” Becky lied.</p>
<p>“Well!” It was clear that her parents were both moved. “So nice to meet you, little boy,” said Amy, and then a look of panic drained her face of all colour. “Shit,” she said. “Shit.” She fluttered her hands.</p>
<p>“Shit,” said the boy, converting the word to a cough.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">my Buckley</span> had made frog’s-eye salad, a selection of Jell-O-suspended cold-cut dishes, and funeral potatoes. These were remarkable, all set out on the dining table in anticipation of the guest. A Mormon feast. “It’s completely inappropriate,” she whimpered, tucking each dish into the refrigerator. Then she barked out a little laugh and said, “Have you any clue?”</p>
<p>“I know he likes wieners,” said Becky. “And I think I saw corn growing at one of the farms.”</p>
<p>“When does he need returning?” said Chuck. “What’s his telephone number?”</p>
<p>“Father,” Becky said, “the Amish eschew technology. Besides, I believe he is adoptable. Myra’s mother will be conducting a process on this.”</p>
<p>Chuck’s eyebrows shot up. “Really?” he said. “I mean, if he were my son, I would be looking for him. Just look at him. He’s absolutely adorable.”</p>
<p>Becky glowed at the “if he were my son” and said, “I don’t expect anyone will be looking for him. He was left on the side of the highway.”</p>
<p>Amy said, “The poor dear,” and then, “Do you think he’d like merguez sausages?”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he Amish</span> dipped the lamb sausage into a pool of yellow mustard on his plate. He ate mustard exclusively that first night. And the second as well. The Buckleys googled and made various internet-approved Amish dishes, but the boy refused them. The fat that had so darlingly wrapped around his knees and wrists began to look flaccid and grey. Becky spent an hour searching out Amish websites and coming up empty. “There just isn’t much online.”</p>
<p>The Amish grew listless and clingy.</p>
<p>He would not sleep in the spare room. He would not get in the bed, nor even stay put in the room. So they set up a cot at the end of Becky’s captain’s bed, and by morning he was snuggled in next to her, holding her neck with his open hands. When she moved, he startled, so she had to lie very still until he woke up.</p>
<p>“Don’t die,” she whispered to him. “I love you, little Amish boy.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he Amish was kneeling</span> in the corner of the classroom, his eyes closed tight and his fingers clasped together. “What’s he doing?” Myra said.</p>
<p>“He’s praying,” said Mr. McAuley.</p>
<p>“For what?” Markus was bending down to inspect the boy.</p>
<p>“There are some,” answered Mr. McAuley, “who just make it a habit to pray.” He was thinking of his mother, who prayed under her breath at all times of the day. “They believe their prayers have weight. They believe that by praying they are in service to mankind.”</p>
<p>William looked back and forth from the Amish to Mr. McAuley. “It’s foolhardy. He should be made to stop.” This comment so charged the air, it was clear to them all that a discussion was about to be opened. Already, Mr. McAuley had taken a deep chestful of air to sustain himself for the response he would give. Live and let live, respect the cultures of others, but none of it was necessary as the Amish quickly unclasped his hands and flew once around the room before landing in Becky’s lap.</p>
<p>“He hasn’t eaten a thing besides French’s mustard these last days,” she told the class. “We tried hot dogs, but he seems to have gone off them. I am beginning to be concerned.”</p>
<p>She was beyond concerned. Through the night, she had dreamt of feeding him raisins and then Smarties, such that she had not slept well but had hovered in that superficial sleep that offers no respite. She had grown surly as a result.</p>
<p>The Amish had his hands around her neck and his face nestled into her shoulder. She tried to pull him off, but he went rigid. “Mother,” he said. “Father, mother, wiener, mother, father,” and then he said her name.</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” she said. “Not Becky.” She knew she would have been thrilled by this only days before.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you happy he says your name?” said Myra. She wished the boy would say her name. She scratched along her arms out of anxiety.</p>
<p>“Stop that, Myra. You’re tearing your skin.”</p>
<p>Myra replied, “My mother says our rescue is actionable. She says if we weren’t minors, we could all go to jail for a very long time. And that we have to return him before it gets out of hand. And apologize.” Myra gave a wide smile to Mr. McAuley. “I’ve made a card for us to sign! It’s in my backpack.”</p>
<p>Markus made a fart noise with his mouth, right up close to the Amish, but the foundling just tucked his face deeper into Becky’s collarbone. “Oh, what’s the use?” Markus said. “He’s really no fun.”</p>
<p>“Mr. McAuley, you should never have let us,” wailed Becky. She was wondering what, exactly, Myra had said to her mother. Myra had clearly not stuck to script. “Mr. McAuley, it was very irresponsible of you to have done so.”</p>
<p>Mr. McAuley slumped on his teacher stool, the one he’d built as part of his teacher training. It had Viking markings on it and symbols denoting the future so that, metaphorically, it gazed both backward and forward. He seemed to have no spine. “Children,” he said. “Let me think, please. Afford me some quiet, I beg you.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smallcaps">r. McAuley thought</span> back to the great Wulfin battle of 2008. He had shaved the hair over his ears for that and grown out his straggly beard. He had purchased stainless steel chain mail and a fine helmet. He’d learned some metallurgy. He’d brandished a replica axe and a festooned spear. He recalled the heft of steel clothing, the way it made him feel . . . glorious and impervious and, he would admit only to himself, horny. It was a marvellous combination. He wished himself back on the battlefield with his comrades, fighting a mock war. It was real, as real as anything, and maybe more real. Mr. McAuley looked deeply, intently, at the Amish.</p>
<p>“We must live our dreams,” he said.</p>
<p>Becky flashed to the raisins and Smarties metronomically popping into the foundling’s mouth, the waft of disdain over his little tired face. She preferred not to live her dreams.</p>
<p>“The Amish is signalling to us our worst impulses,” Mr. McAuley whispered.</p>
<p>It was as if their teacher were in a trance. A hammer came down upon his helmet. Life force sprang up his legs and flowed through his every limb. He yelled in the full embodiment of his very self. He was alive!</p>
<p>“Mr. McAuley?” The children came closer to peer at him. “Are you all right?”</p>
<p>Erik McAuley was about to translate his Viking past into something useful, but already he lagged behind current events. The Amish had unwound from Becky and was running toward the windows on the east side of the room, his eyes widened in some sort of recognition.</p>
<p>Veeshla, the school secretary, stood in the doorway of the classroom, her blond hair groomed into a ponytail. “You have a visitor,” she said. “Outside.” She lifted her eyebrows to indicate urgency. She pointed to the window. The foundling had somehow pulled himself onto the shelf and was standing, pressed wholly&mdash;each bit of his front&mdash;up against the glass.</p>
<p>Becky tried to pull him back. She feared he would break through and plummet. “You mustn’t, you mustn’t,” she cooed, trying to suppress the tiny scream that bubbled in her throat. She had already seen what was below. It was a black buggy pulled by two sweat-shiny mares.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he man wore</span> an immaculate blue shirt, crisply pressed, with finely sewn-on buttons. His beard was combed so that it spread over his chest. His hat appeared brand new. His black trousers were creased, and the buggy itself was glowing clean. There was a woman in a bonnet in the back. Neither of them said a word, nor did they look from side to side. Myra flung the handmade, never-signed card at the father. The class chorused their apologies, and Becky lifted the Amish up and into the carriage. The couple still did not turn but only nodded. Their silence was so magnetic that the class experienced an electric guilt so nervous, so amplified, and so permanent they began one by one to sob.</p>
<p>The father flicked the reins, and the horses burst into a trot. And here is where the foundling began to cry too, first soft heaves down in his wee belly but then audibly and inconsolably. His mother watched him. He was screaming before the carriage reached the corner, and he had climbed up the seat. He peered through the rectangular opening in the back of the carriage, his chubby hands gripping either side of the cut-out window. The class stood in the middle of the road and watched him, anguished. William made to run after the vehicle, but Mr. McAuley held him back.</p>
<p>And what nobody could agree on later, but which Becky knew was true, it clung to her so painfully and so indelibly, was the form his screams took. “Becky!” he cried. “Becky! Becky!” His arms flung out the hole in the buggy, reaching back, back toward them.</p>
<p>“I will find them when I get back to the farm,” said William, nobly, to placate poor Becky, who had stolen a living child, after all, and must feel horrid.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n the weeks</span> that followed, Mr. McAuley led debriefing sessions in which the children were encouraged to grieve. </p>
<p>“Life is a battle,” he confided to Veeshla in the staff lunchroom during this trying time, and she replied that he “hadn’t better tell this to the children.” The story&mdash;for it was becoming one&mdash;was replayed and revised until it was felt that the wounds were sufficiently healed. Still, no one was alarmed when a game sprang up involving the theft of a sad “It” who must then escape. The class played the Amish Game fervently through middle school until the end of grade eight, when they graduated and lost contact with one another. William’s father eventually sold the farm to pay for college. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/care-and-feeding-of-the-amish/">Care and Feeding of the Amish</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lawrence stepped out</span> of the office in a foul mood. He’d had to discipline one of the project supervisors for submitting an incomplete report, and it did not go well. This supervisor, Alan, felt that the report was complete, even though its incompleteness was a matter of fact, not opinion. The interaction became somewhat heated, and now Lawrence’s lunch break was ruined. He would spend the whole hour continuing the argument with Alan in his head. He walked to the newsstand down the street and purchased his usual three papers and a small coffee. He continued on toward the park. The audacity, Lawrence thought. The audacity of Alan.</p>
<div class="su-pullquote su-pullquote-align-left">

</div>
<p>Waiting at the intersection to cross over to the park, he noticed something in the window of the pawnshop on the corner&mdash;a figurine of a boy. A little cowboy. Plaid shirt tucked into jeans. Classic cowboy hat, cute scarf. The boy’s hands were positioned at his hips, like he was readying to draw his pistols, but he didn’t have any pistols. Lawrence leaned in close to the window and studied the doll. The boy’s expression was sneaky but good natured. Lawrence felt his mood soften.</p>
<p>In the park, finding his preferred bench unoccupied, he sat and unwrapped his sandwich. Tuna with cut-up pickle pieces. Normally, he read through the local paper while he ate, but today he was distracted by his exchange with the project supervisor. Alan was becoming a real problem. But forget all that, Lawrence thought. It’s a beautiful day. Young people walking by with strollers and dogs. Squirrels chasing each other. And that funny little cowboy doll. A wholesome piece of craftsmanship. It was really something. Thinking about the doll cheered him up. Maybe it would look nice in his office at home. An inspirational cowboy to remind him of the goodness in the world. He rarely purchased anything for himself. He sipped his coffee. He finished his sandwich. He walked back to the pawnshop.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” Lawrence said, entering the shop. The old man behind the counter looked up from his magazine. “How much for the cowboy in the window?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Buddy West,” the old man said. “Five hundred.”</p>
<p>“Five hundred dollars?”</p>
<p>“Yup. A real collector’s item. From the thirties. You’ve got a good eye.”</p>
<p>“I also have common sense. Good Lord. If someone is willing to pay five hundred dollars for a little cowboy figurine, then there is something deeply wrong with them.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s what he runs for.”</p>
<p>“And this was a waste of my time.”</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Back at work,</span> Lawrence noticed a certain awkward energy around the office. Everyone seemed slightly uncomfortable. Working away at their desks as usual but now with an invisible cloud of negativity hovering over them. Alan was out on his lunch now. He probably told the other supervisors about their interaction. With clear bias. Word spread around. Anyway, no matter. He had his own report to finish. He sat down in front of his computer.</p>
<p>His desk phone rang. His wife’s number appeared on the display.</p>
<p>“Everything okay?” Lawrence said.</p>
<p>“Yes and no,” Millie said. “I mean we’re fine. It’s the neighbour again. Are you still on lunch?”</p>
<p>“No, and I’m rather busy. What did the idiot do now?”</p>
<p>“He was marching around in his backyard without any clothing. Toby was home for lunch and saw.”</p>
<p>“Marching?”</p>
<p>“He was naked, Lawrence.”</p>
<p>“Is there anything I can do right now? Do you want me to come home in the middle of my workday and deal with the situation?”</p>
<p>“Well, no.”</p>
<p>“Now I’ll be distracted and bothered by this, and it will affect my work. But there’s nothing I can actually do about it while I’m here. So you’ve upset me for no reason. Thanks for that.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, honey. I just thought you should know.”</p>
<p>“What’s done is done. We’ll deal with the neighbour when I get home. I’ve got to get back to work. Is Toby okay?”</p>
<p>“He’s fine. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“I’ve gotta go.”</p>
<p>Lawrence hung up the phone and sat back in his chair. The draft of his report on screen, cursor blinking. Alan came walking down the hall, back from lunch. Was he <em>grinning</em>?</p>
<p>I’m going to buy that damn cowboy, Lawrence thought.</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Lawrence poked</span> his way home through rush-hour traffic with an unusual calmness. He’d managed to talk the proprietor down to four-fifty, and now the briefcase resting on the passenger seat contained one rare, mint-condition, 1930s’ Buddy West statuette. A smart and valuable investment, but more than that, the doll emanated a pleasant, peaceful aura. It would improve his day-to-day life by reminding him of the wholesomeness still out there in the world, and it was thus a practical purchase. Still, Lawrence thought, it might be best to keep the particulars of the transaction from Millie. She might find four hundred and fifty bucks steep for a doll, even though it was clear now that he’d made a wise financial decision. Stopped at a particularly slow light a few blocks from home, Lawrence reached inside his briefcase and crinkled the protective paper around Buddy West’s head. </p>
<p>“Almost home, Buddy,” Lawrence said. </p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Lawrence took off</span> his coat and shoes and entered the living room, where he found Millie and Toby sprawled out on the couch and floor respectively, staring expressionless at the TV. A man on screen was walking down a hospital hallway with a rifle, shooting everyone. </p>
<p>“What the hell are you watching?” Lawrence said. </p>
<p>“It’s a commercial for something else,” Millie said. She hadn’t changed out of the clothes she’d slept in the night before. “We’re watching <em>MasterChef</em>.”</p>
<p>“I saw the neighbour’s peen,” Toby said.</p>
<p>“Don’t say ‘peen,’” Lawrence said.</p>
<p>“What are we going to do?” Millie said. “The Palmer kid was completely naked, Lawrence. Right out in the open.”</p>
<p>“Christ, I just walked in the door. This is my greeting? Anyway, I’ll have to go over there. This behaviour simply can’t continue. What was he doing?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, he just was out there, wandering around the yard. Showing off, I guess.”</p>
<p>“It’s a provocation. That’s what it is. He’s trying to provoke us. I’m going to put my things away and wash up, then head over there. Which I’m not looking forward to, by the way. You wouldn’t believe the day I’ve had.”</p>
<p>“It looked crazy,” Toby said. “He has a huge peener.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say ‘peener,’” Lawrence said. “Don’t say ‘peen.’”  </p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">The Palmer home</span> had fallen into disrepair. Overgrown lawn. Eavestrough clogged with leaves. A pair of jeans lying in a puddle in the driveway. Boxes filled with beer cans scattered around the porch. Lawrence rang the doorbell and waited. The lights weren’t on and the shades were drawn, but the lights were never on and the shades were always drawn. The Palmer kid did not leave the property as far as he knew. The “kid,” who was actually in his thirties, had moved in that summer after his mother passed. Mr. Palmer had died the previous winter. The senior Palmers had been kind, respectful neighbours. Their families never interacted beyond exchanging basic pleasantries in the driveway, but Lawrence could tell they were hardworking. Mr. Palmer was in insurance pre retirement, and Mrs. Palmer taught piano lessons out of their home, right up until the end. Lawrence had never seen their son around&mdash;until he took over the house. And now here he was, occupying his deceased parents’ once-beautiful home, lazing around, no job, no respect for home ownership, or even basic personal hygiene, from what Lawrence could tell. Something seriously off about the guy. Most days, he’d wander into the backyard and exercise. Push-ups, lunges. He’d sprint between the patio door and the back fence, grunting. He’d jump up and grab onto a branch from the Palmers’ oak and hang there for extended periods. Sometimes he’d bring out a huge machete and use it to swat at tennis balls. Sociopathic behaviour. And now, apparently, he was adding public nudity to his repertoire. Destroying everyone’s property values. </p>
<div class="su-pullquote su-pullquote-align-left">

<p class="pull-quote-SR23">The Palmer kid shut the door. Lawrence stood there, in shock. He thought about ringing the doorbell again. The nerve.</p>

</div>
<p>Footsteps clomped toward the door. It swung open, and there stood the Palmer kid, shirtless and glassy eyed. He didn’t say anything. His home unlit at six o’clock. </p>
<p>“Hi there,” Lawrence said. “Lawrence from next door. Do you have a second to talk?”</p>
<p>“What do you want?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to bother you, but my wife says she saw you out in the backyard earlier and you weren’t wearing any clothes. My nine-year-old saw too. Which is obviously not ideal. And so I’m wondering if you could please, you know, wear clothes. In the backyard, where my family can see you.”</p>
<p>“No, I was wearing clothes.” </p>
<p>“Well, okay. But my wife says she saw you.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to tell you. You know, I’ve seen your wife out on your patio with her glasses of wine. While I guess she’s supposed to be watching your kid. You should probably keep an eye on that.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to tell you, man. Anyway, I’m busy.”</p>
<p>The Palmer kid shut the door. Lawrence stood there, in shock. He thought about ringing the doorbell again. The nerve. Making accusations like that. He turned around and went home.</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Millie was</span> plating dinner in the kitchen. Vegetable lasagna and garlic toast soldiers. Toby at the dining room table, pushing his knuckles into his eye sockets. “Toby, enough,” Lawrence said, walking past. The TV was turned up loud in the other room so Millie and Toby could listen to the end of their show.</p>
<p>“Are you sure he was naked?” Lawrence said. “Because he denies it.”</p>
<p>“Of course I’m sure,” Millie said. </p>
<p>“He said something about you drinking wine.”</p>
<p>“He said that?”</p>
<p>“Is this something we need to talk about?”</p>
<p>“Jesus, Lawrence. He was naked. I saw him. Toby saw him. There’s no room for interpretation there. What did he say exactly?”</p>
<p>“So you <em>were</em> drinking?”</p>
<p>“I had a glass of wine. Is that ‘drinking’? And that’s not anyone’s business anyway. You think I got drunk and then, like, hallucinated? Was Toby drinking and hallucinating?”</p>
<p>“No, I know. I’m a little concerned is all. That everything’s okay with you. Have you put any thought into going back to work? I don’t know. It could be good for you.”</p>
<p>“I had a glass of wine, Lawrence. You know, that’s incredibly insulting. I don’t feel like eating. I’m going upstairs.”</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Millie wouldn&#8217;t</span> come out of their bedroom. Toby helped Lawrence clean up after dinner. They went into the living room afterward and watched a documentary about a microchip factory until Toby fell asleep. Lawrence carried his son to bed and then checked in on Millie. Sleeping, or pretending to.</p>
<p>In the evenings, Lawrence usually brought a plate of cheese and crackers and a peppermint tea up to his office, where he’d read through the papers he’d bought on his lunch break. He prepared his snack and turned on the kettle. While waiting for the water to boil, he checked the recycling bin. An empty wine bottle lay beneath the lasagna box. Did Millie drink it all that afternoon or finish up an old bottle? He couldn’t ask, not now. Anyway, he was better off ignoring his unhinged neighbour’s comments. Another provocation.</p>
<div class="su-pullquote su-pullquote-align-left">

</div>
<p>Upstairs, Lawrence set his plate and mug and newspapers down on the table beside his chair, then unwrapped Buddy West. He placed the doll on the shelf above his desk, next to the antique clock. The statuette fit the room and in fact improved the overall ambience. It made him think of the old western films he watched as a child with his father and a simpler way of life that was hearty and good. He sat back in his chair. The newspapers he’d purchased lay on the table next to him, unread. There wasn’t anything in there he needed to know. It was enough to sit and enjoy his little piece of Americana. That’s what it was: Americana. He liked that word. The more he stared at Buddy West, the calmer he felt. He didn’t think about his deranged neighbour. Or Alan. Or Millie storming off and sleeping through dinner. He thought about Buddy West and what a smart purchase he’d made. Worth every penny.</p>
<p>Lawrence stood up and walked over to the shelf.</p>
<p>“You’re worth every penny,” he said. “Yes. I got the sweet end of that deal. What do you think, do you like it here? This is your home.” </p>
<p>Buddy West smiled.</p>
<p>“Well, goodnight, Buddy. Let me know if you need anything.”</p>
<p>He paused in the doorway and took one last look at his clever little guy before turning off the light. </p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">The next morning at work,</span> Lawrence was summoned to Mr. Halton’s office. Mr. Halton was the general manager. Lawrence’s boss. When he walked in, Alan was already sitting there. What the hell is this, Lawrence thought. Alan’s head pitched forward, hands clasped in his lap. Weak, defeated body language. Good.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Lawrence,” Mr. Halton said. “Sit down.”</p>
<p>“Good morning, Mr. Halton. Alan.”</p>
<p>“We need to discuss yesterday’s incident.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid you will have to fill me in. I’m unaware of any incident.”</p>
<p>“Apparently you spoke to Alan in a harsh and inappropriate manner. And used an offensive word.”</p>
<p>“Offensive word? What word?”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t want to repeat it. An outdated, derogatory term.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t believe I used any words like that. Although, thinking back to yesterday, perhaps I employed the past participle of ‘retard,’ as in ‘to delay progress.’ Which would be the correct usage when referring to Alan’s incomplete report.”</p>
<p>“You said I was that word,” Alan said.</p>
<p>“And you delayed the progress of our company by submitting unfinished work. Although I’m not sure I used that exact word. But would have been correct if I did.”</p>
<p>“Lawrence, come on,” Mr. Halton said. “This isn’t the first time I’ve received complaints about your interpersonal behaviour. We’re a team here. I know you’ve had a rough go of it this year. All of us here, you know, we’re all sympathetic. But we need to work together. We can’t have this kind of behaviour in the office. Bullying and inappropriate language.”</p>
<p>“Alan: did you or did you not submit an incomplete report to me yesterday? Yes or no.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the issue,” Mr. Halton said. “Forget the report. We’re here to discuss your demeanour.”</p>
<p>“All I did was take Alan aside and, respectfully, explain to him that his work was unacceptable. Perhaps I used a word that he misconstrued as an offensive term, I don’t know. I can loan you my dictionary, Alan, if you want to work on your vocabulary and avoid similar misapprehensions in the future.”</p>
<p>“Lawrence, just listen. You need to adjust your attitude a little, okay? You don’t need to be so harsh with your co-workers. Understood?”</p>
<p>“I understand your premise but reject the conclusion. I will continue to conduct myself professionally. No adjustment needed.”</p>
<p>Mr. Halton sat back in his chair and rubbed his palms over his eyes. He sighed. “Just apologize to Alan, Lawrence. I don’t want this to drag on all day.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Alan, if you felt hurt by what I said. Although you literally delayed our progress as a company by submitting incomplete and shoddy work, and all I did was point this out.”</p>
<p>“Do you hear this?” Alan said, the little worm.</p>
<p>“Just apologize, Lawrence. No editorializing, no excuses. Say you’re sorry.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” Lawrence said. “I’m <em>sorry</em>, Alan. Are we done here?” </p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Two old women</span> had taken over Lawrence’s preferred park bench. He stood off to the side, holding his coffee and sandwich, looking over at them with a polite smile. Hopefully they would recognize the social cue and relinquish the bench. He tucked his sandwich under his coffee-holding arm and called Millie.</p>
<p>“Thank God,” she said, answering. “I didn’t want to bug you at work again.”</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“He’s out there again, naked. I think he’s still there. He <em>waved</em> at me, Lawrence.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I went out on the patio and looked over, and he saw me and waved right at me. While naked. I ran back inside, and I’m too afraid to look out the window. In case he sees me and waves again. Thankfully, Toby’s back at school. I don’t know what to do.”</p>
<p>“Okay, calm down. Are you sure he’s naked? How much have you had to drink?”</p>
<p>“You can’t be serious. You didn’t just say that.”</p>
<p>“It’s only a question. Simply answer it, and we can move on. I assume you’re sober and saw everything clearly, but I need to ask so I can get a clear picture of the situation. That’s all.”</p>
<p>There was no response. Lawrence looked at his phone. Millie had hung up. He tried calling back&mdash;no answer. Fantastic.</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” Lawrence said. The two women on the bench looked over. “Are you almost finished? This is a communal bench, you know. Let’s remember to share.”</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Lawrence returned</span> home that evening to find Millie and Toby watching <em>MasterChef</em> again. Millie wouldn’t look at him. He asked Toby to fetch him a glass of water from the kitchen, then knelt down beside the couch, next to Millie.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” he said. His second apology of the day. Sometimes it was best to just say the words so everyone can move on, he was learning. “I’ve had a stressful day. I didn’t mean to upset you. Tell me what happened. Did you see him out there again?”</p>
<p>“It’s okay.” Millie reached over and rested her hand on his arm. </p>
<p>“And no. I looked out after you called, and he was gone. Haven’t seen him since. He waved at me, Lawrence. Should we call the police? I mean, it is his yard. But you can’t walk around naked where your neighbours can see, can you? And wave at them? He had this sinister look in his eyes.”</p>
<div class="su-pullquote su-pullquote-align-left">
<img src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/SR23_Klassen_Buddy_5.jpg" alt="Illustration of a baby bottle" class="alignnone pull-quote-image size-full wp-image-156713" />
</div>
<p>“He’s testing us. Well, I’m going over there. He’s not getting away with this&mdash;nope.”</p>
<p>Toby re-entered the room and handed Lawrence a baby bottle.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” Lawrence said.</p>
<p>“I got your water,” Toby said.</p>
<p>“Why is it in a baby bottle? Where did you get this?”</p>
<p>“I found it in that box in the closet. I thought it would be funny. It’s a practical joke.”</p>
<p>Millie turned to face the back of the sofa. Quivering.</p>
<p>“Mom, are you okay?”</p>
<p>“She’s fine. Let’s go put the bottle back, Toby. Come on.”</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Lawrence rang</span> the doorbell and knocked three times forcefully. It was important to establish a firm tone from the get-go. No answer. Lawrence knocked again, with even more oomph. Eventually, footsteps approached.</p>
<p>“Oh,” the Palmer kid said, opening the door.</p>
<p>“You were naked again. After I specifically told you to keep your clothes on.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p>“My wife saw you. This is unacceptable. If you wish to sunbathe or whatever it is you’re doing, you will have to build a proper fence or put in hedges. I looked it up. If we can see you, even from our upstairs windows, you can be charged with indecent exposure.”</p>
<p>“Look, man. I wasn’t naked. I wasn’t even home today. I’m sorry your wife is having these fantasies involving me or whatever, but that’s not my business.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“I’m not judging you guys or anything. We all have our issues, right? You know, my dad was an alcoholic. I know what it’s like to be around all that.”</p>
<p>“My wife is not an alcoholic. And she certainly isn’t having fantasies involving you. This ends now. Do not wave to my wife, or talk to her, or even look at her. And keep your goddamn clothes on. I will not warn you again.”</p>
<p>“Hey, man, I’m sorry for whatever it is that’s going on with you right now, but I don’t appreciate the attitude. You should probably leave.”</p>
<p>The Palmer kid shut the door. The lock clicked.</p>
<p>“You will keep your clothes on!” Lawrence shouted into the door. He turned to leave, shaking, and saw Mrs. Connell from across the street hurry past with her poodle, eyes cast down toward the sidewalk.</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Once Toby was in bed,</span> Lawrence prepared his tea and snack and went up to his office. He turned on the desk lamp and sat down in his reading chair.</p>
<p>“Hey, Buddy,” he said, glancing up at Buddy West. Then he opened the <em>Globe</em>. His eyes traced over the words on the page, but he didn’t take anything in. He set the paper down. Looked back up at Buddy West.</p>
<p>“Let’s get a closer look at you.”</p>
<p>He retrieved the doll from the shelf and sat down with it. The hat was removable, Lawrence discovered. He removed it. Reddish-blonde hair. Made from real hair? He brushed it with his fingers.</p>
<p>“Does that feel nice?” he said. “Actually, sit tight.” </p>
<p>Lawrence set the doll down and left his office. He stepped carefully down the hall and went into the bathroom. In the cupboard above the sink, he found the little moustache comb from when he’d had a moustache. Perfect. On his way back to his office, he stopped. Listened. Millie was snoring lightly. Silence from Toby’s room. He turned around and crept over to the little room at the end of the hallway. He opened the door slowly. The room smelled musty&mdash;he would have to open the window and air it out soon. Quietly, he opened one of the boxes next to the bassinet. Tiny onesies. He opened another box and poked through until he found the book Millie’s mother had brought to the hospital: <em>Happy Farm Animals</em>. He closed the boxes and shut the door and returned to his office.</p>
<p>“Look at this, Buddy,” Lawrence said. He set the book on his knees, Buddy West nestled in his lap. He combed the doll’s hair gently. “Look at all the animals. Look at the horsey.”</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">The next day at work,</span> the awkward atmosphere permeating the office continued to permeate&mdash;and perhaps was worse. Lawrence’s co-workers wouldn’t meet his eye. He’d go into the break room and the person in there would walk out, mid-snack. There were glances in his direction&mdash;negative ones. He soldiered on.</p>
<p>Lawrence returned home that evening to find Toby catatonic in front of the TV. Chocolate frosting on his face. What looked to be old footage of a funeral procession on screen. Crowds lining the streets. Princess Diana’s funeral, Lawrence realized.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2em;"><img src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/SR23_Klassen_Buddy_4.jpg" alt="Illustration of a light pink couch with two cushions and a white blanket draped over the top." width="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-156714" /></p>
<p>“Why are you watching this?</p>
<p>“Hi, Dad. I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Did you put this on, or did Mom put this on?”</p>
<p>“Uh, I don’t know. Mom put it on.”</p>
<p>“Where is your mom?”</p>
<p>“She’s having a bath.”</p>
<p>Lawrence took off his coat and shoes and climbed the stairs to the bathroom. He knocked gently. No answer.</p>
<p>“Millie?” Lawrence said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” a soft voice answered.</p>
<p>He went in. Millie was sitting up in the tub, staring straight ahead at the wall. Lawrence stepped over and dipped his hand in the water. It was cold.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Lawrence said. “It’s freezing.”</p>
<p>“Sorry. I guess I lost track of time.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be sorry. Didn’t you notice the temperature drop? Let’s get you out of here. Come on.”</p>
<p>He helped Millie stand up and climb out onto the bath mat. He wrapped a towel around her shoulders and then wrapped another around her hair. He used a third towel to pat her arms and legs dry and then walked Millie to the bedroom. He pulled her robe and a pair of socks from the dresser. Millie sat down at the end of the bed, and Lawrence sat next to her. He held her close and rubbed her back over the towel.</p>
<p>“Oh, Millie. Are you doing okay?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m right here.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Lawrence was</span> preparing his tea and snack in the kitchen when he heard a thumping noise. A steady, pounding rhythm. He opened the window above the sink, and it got louder. Dance music. Techno or whatever they call it nowadays. Coming from the Palmer house.</p>
<p>Upstairs in his office, Lawrence didn’t even bother with his newspapers. He took Buddy West down and walked him around the room. He told the doll about the situation at work. He told him about the techno. He stood by the window.</p>
<p>“That’s the idiot’s house there. Sad state of affairs. But that’s the view. You probably get sick of staring at the one wall all day, huh? I should get you a little television set. Wouldn’t that be nice?”</p>
<p>He brought Buddy West over to his bachelor’s degree hanging by the door.</p>
<p>“Got this at McGill. Which is in Montreal. Great school. Those were the days. I was on the dean’s list.”</p>
<p>He sat back down in his chair. The doll resting on his legs, looking up at him. He took a piece of cheese from his snack plate and pretended to feed it to the doll, then laughed softly.</p>
<p>“You’d love Montreal, Buddy. Plenty to see and do. Of course, you’re more of an outdoorsman. Riding the range and whatnot, right? Well, maybe we could take a little trip out west. Get you out on that range. Wouldn’t that be something. You and me.”</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” another voice said.</p>
<p>Lawrence jolted forward in his chair, dropping the doll onto the floor. He looked over. Millie stood in the doorway in her bathrobe and socks, looking confused.</p>
<p>“Jesus, Millie. You scared me.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. Where did you get that doll?”</p>
<p>“It’s an antique statuette. Decorative. I thought it would look nice in here. I was cleaning it before you interrupted.”</p>
<p>“Are you okay? Is this about Malcolm?”</p>
<p>“What? Millie, no. Jesus. I was just muttering nonsense.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. It’s good to process things.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t processing anything. I was muttering nonsense. I’m tired. It’s been a hell of a day. Anyway, it’s rude to eavesdrop. You should knock or cough to let the person know you’re there before listening in on what could be a private moment. I was only muttering, but still. Let’s work on our manners.” </p>
<p>Millie continued on to the bathroom, and Lawrence brought Buddy West downstairs and into the garage. He could hear the music from next door still pounding away. With a sigh, he placed the doll in the garbage bin. It had been compromised. Compromised by Millie. Now it only made him feel silly. It was silly of him to purchase a doll. He went inside and washed his hands. He poured himself a glass of water. At the staircase, he turned around and returned to the garage. He took the doll from the trash and wiped it off with his sleeve and placed it in the trunk of his car. He’d spent a small fortune on the thing. Maybe he could sell it. He went inside and washed his hands again and went to bed.</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">It was a Saturday,</span> so Lawrence slept in until eight-thirty and then joined his family at the kitchen table. Millie had the waffle maker going. She’d changed out of her usual loungewear. A smart blouse. Her hair looked different. It looked nice.</p>
<p>“You look nice,” Lawrence said.</p>
<p>“Oh, thanks. I’m going to get groceries later. If you wanna come. Toby might go over to Dickie’s this afternoon.”</p>
<p>“<em>Maybe</em>,” Toby said. “Dickie has to promise to crate his dog. Only then will I go.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with Dickie’s dog?” Millie said.</p>
<p>“Wait.” Lawrence raised his hands. “Everyone be quiet.” He listened. The thumping. The neighbour’s techno music&mdash;it was still going.</p>
<p>“Oh,” Millie said. “He must have fallen asleep or something. I can’t imagine how.”</p>
<p>“It’s on purpose. He’s trying to mess with me. Well, that’s it. I’m going over there. And if he won’t come to the door, I’m calling the police. I’ve had it.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2em;"><img src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/SR23_Klassen_Buddy_6.jpg" alt="Illustration of a pile of dumbbells" width="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-156714" /></p>
<p>Lawrence walked over to the Palmers’ place and banged on the door. The music coming from inside shook the front window in its frame. Will the kid even hear me over all this, he wondered. He knocked louder. He rang the doorbell. He rapped on the window. He waited. No answer. Lawrence tried the knob&mdash;it wasn’t locked. He opened the door a crack. The music got louder.</p>
<p>“Hello?” Lawrence called out. “It’s your neighbour!”</p>
<p>He opened the door a little wider. He poked his head inside. The lights were off. It smelled of body odour and mould and neglect. He went in. Turned his phone’s flashlight on. He could see into the dining room. The table and chairs and a cabinet were all pushed up against one wall, and there were various dumbbells lying in the middle of the floor. He walked into another room, which appeared to be the living room. Clothes strewn about. The TV on the floor had a large crack in the middle of the screen. There were several plastic pitchers of water placed out on the coffee table for some reason. He went upstairs.</p>
<p>The thumping bass boomed even louder. The walls rattled. He stepped over some towels piled up at the top of the stairs and went into the room where the music seemed to be coming from. A lump in the middle of the bed. Uh-oh, Lawrence thought. He pressed the light switch. The Palmer kid was splayed out on the mattress, his head resting in vomit. Pill bottles on the floor next to the bed. Lawrence couldn’t hear his own voice cry out for help.</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Lawrence took</span> a personal leave from work&mdash;Mr. Halton was all too happy to sign off on it. He spent a lot of time staring out into the neighbour’s yard. Millie would see him standing there at his office window and rest her hands on his shoulders. Come on, she’d say. Then he’d follow her to the living room, and they’d watch TV with Toby.</p>
<p>Lawrence eventually went back to work. Millie too. It took her some time to adjust, but she adjusted. Christmas came and went. They brought the television upstairs and turned the nursery into a little home theatre. They even put in an old-fashioned cinema popcorn machine that Lawrence found on eBay, but Toby burned his hand on it pretty bad, and they had to throw it away.</p>
<p>Sometimes Lawrence would drive by the cemetery on his way home from work, slow down, and give a little nod. A few days after the funeral, Lawrence had taken Buddy West out there and stashed him in a bush. He had to wait until the groundskeeper wasn’t looking. It felt right having him there, outdoors, in his element, watching over the three Palmers. Watching over Malcolm. Projecting his good nature out across the greenery and into the afterlife.  </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/buddy-west/">Buddy West</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<div class="smallcaps">AFTERNOON, MONDAY, JULY 20 </div>
<p>Bad news. The wolves in the nearby provincial park have finally mastered the use of bicycles. It was only a matter of time. Everyone&mdash;town local and park beast alike&mdash;envies the beautiful out-of-town cyclists who swarm the trails this time of year. The taut, hairless perfection of their thighs and sleek racing suits make us all feel like slobs, given to degenerate practices like eating gluten and encountering air resistance. </p>
<div class="su-pullquote su-pullquote-align-left">
<img src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/SR23_Klassen_Bicycle_2.jpg" alt="Illustration of wolf standing on its hind legs and holding a bicycle wheel up to get a closer look at it" class="alignnone pull-quote-image size-full wp-image-156713" />
</div>
<p>It has taken the pack a few months to get the hang of the machines, during which many gorgeous cyclists were menaced and their bikes stolen. The Park is full of discarded tires lying like snakeskin along the trails, and its visitor centre teems with recently mugged city folk, their faces exquisite even in sorrow. </p>
<p>Problem can no longer be ignored. Today a ranger spotted two wolves on a carbon-frame Ibis tearing down a hill at fifty kilometres per hour. They can run at the same speed apparently, but I understand why they would forsake their paws for the symmetry of those two wheels. We all wish, sometimes, to rebel against the body assigned to us by the bureaucracy of the heavens. </p>

<p>Townsfolk are terrified of the fiscal and aesthetic repercussions should beautiful cyclists stop visiting The Park for fear of our thieving wolves. Breakfast restaurants abuzz with talk of advancing the local doomsday clock. Mayor Ron was missing for hours this morning before the municipal policy team found him lying down smoking cigarettes in the ditch behind Lorraine Halbert’s pancake house. We draw straws, and I am the one who must wrestle him out. Too muddy afterward to get pancakes. I help brainstorm ways to address wolf problem by shouting through an open window of the restaurant to my colleagues inside. Mayor Ron shares his cigarettes with a parking lot attendant throughout, chatting amiably. </p>
<p>No immediate solution to wolves, which are perfect killing machines subject to provincial conservation laws. Team returns to Town Hall dejected and full of refined flours. We are flattened by misery, scattered around the office like dead bumblebees. </p>
<div class="smallcaps">MORNING, TUESDAY, JULY 21 </div>
<p>More bad news. The Town’s new “toilet paper reconciliation” policy, an initiative I suggested, looks to be a failure. It gives local Indigenous folk permission to cover one white citizen’s home in bathroom tissue every month. I had pitched it as the perfect act of government reconciliation in its feel-good meaninglessness. </p>
<p>Trouble stems from last night, when the Métis council swathed the home of local business magnate David Roads. This was due to his consistent refusal to tip the native youth working at the gas station. Everyone attending had a wonderful time. Bannock was provided while children played fiddle jigs well into the early hours. David Roads is furious, claiming his bichon frise is now paralyzed with anxiety and also allergic to the rough fibres present in our cheap two-ply. He threatens Mayor Ron with pulling funds for this year’s County Fair, a ferociously popular event. Despite this, the Town is very much on the side of the Métis council; we all hate the nasty prices David Roads imposes through his local monopoly on pork meat, his chrome lawnmower so loud it killed all the birds in the neighbourhood, and his terrible mansion with its endless windows, each a different size and shape. </p>
<p>Mayor Ron livid with me today over failure of toilet paper policy. I eat the blame knowing my colleagues would do the same for me, our bond forged in the savage trenches of municipal governance. Definite potential for me to invoke my own Métis identity to defend myself, but I can see it would not help matters. Mayor Ron reaches a state of panic, tearing his clothes in a biblical fashion and screaming about the “jackals of the press” feasting on the “bayonetted carcass of his career.” Policy team must strap him into the backseat of a car and drive him along the empty highways until he gradually falls into the fretful slumber of a child. </p>
<div class="smallcaps">EVENING, TUESDAY, JULY 21 </div>
<p>I attend Métis council meeting to broach the subject of rolling back toilet paper reconciliation. Propose hastily developed alternative, something tentatively labelled “knife bingo,” but, predictably, am shot down by the elders. Clement Forester is president, and he has hated me for years. I am told my pants are too tight and am accused of being a coastal elite. He makes spurious accusations that I eat eleven-dollar quinoa salads and wear Lululemons while working in “new media.” Says I “have a face like a fucking pogo stick.” Clement Forester knows these are wild exaggerations, but he has recently joined a new Facebook group and is particularly radicalized at the moment against anyone under forty who hasn’t died in a war. For all of the dignity among my people, we are not immune to the firewater of social media, the silicone blankets of ignorance distributed by the idiot innovators of California. Council is unanimous against me&mdash;toilet paper reconciliation must remain. </p>
<div class="su-pullquote su-pullquote-align-left">

<p class="pull-quote-SR23">Council is unanimous against me&mdash;toilet paper reconciliation must remain.</p>

</div>
<p>When I get home, my house is dark and quiet. I stand in the kitchen and smoosh my face against the backyard screen door for two hours, breathing in the smell of wet grass and the lone chrysanthemum bush. Fantasize about the political downfall of Clement Forester as I contemplate his words and the halfway house of my own identity. </p>
<p>I try to imagine what it would feel like to be irrepressibly Indigenous, the sort of native that people expect. Picture myself riding into Town Hall’s open-concept office on a horse as mixed as I am to stare mournfully into the middle distance of our video-conferencing camera. Public relations potential would be scintillating. </p>
<p>Peel myself off the screen door and boil kettle as I consider possibility that I’ve been infected with a settler notion of what it <em>means</em> to be native, like any other virus brought over from the old world. But I take too much enjoyment in the way my cultural betweenness makes me outrageously popular on LinkedIn for this to be true. Still, cannot help but dream occasionally of a life in which my DVD shelf full of British prestige drama generates less psychic weight. </p>
<p>Guilty thoughts surface about the traditional point-blanket capote stuffed in the back of my closet, which I never wear because I always struggle to fish my work lanyard from its thick woolen folds. I drink coffee and lie on the couch, living within the margins of myself. I expect it will be 1:00 a.m. when I begin to drift off to the sibilant screams of raccoons making love outside. </p>

<div class="smallcaps">MORNING, WEDNESDAY, JULY 22 </div>
<p>Town Hall receives notice from David Roads’s lawyer confirming he has pulled sizable funds out of the County Fair in rude vengeance for his toilet-papered McMansion. County Fair unlikely to move forward. We are desolate. Never again shall we cheer at the raw-vegetable eating contest, where girthy turnips skirt the bounds of decency and so rile up the Town’s elderly that it had a role in sparking the historic Rutabaga Riots of the 1980s. Nor can we buy another batch of menacing homecrafts from the farmers’ market; the sticky film of memory coats last year’s purchases like honey. No more boutique honey stalls either, for that matter. </p>
<p>What’s more, the bicycle wolves have now repossessed enough machines to rove in packs and are making raids on the visitor’s centre. The rangers trapped inside have been forced to eat the huge stocks of overpriced energy bars usually sold to tourists, threatening the Parks Department with total financial ruin. </p>
<p>Spit-roast between the loss of the County Fair and the wheeled wolf menace, Mayor Ron has become completely deranged. Personal Assistant Emily stands at the door of his office throughout the day and spear-tackles him every time he tries to flee. PA Emily is powerful, and we all fear her. A crowd gathers during one of Mayor Ron’s attempts to wrestle his way past. As I watch, a thought arrives in my head like a utility pole knocked into a river. I have just booked a meeting room through the office’s shared Excel spreadsheet in a state of delirium. </p>
<div class="smallcaps">AFTERNOON, WEDNESDAY, JULY 22</div>
<p>Policy team assembles to hear my pitch, Mayor Ron handcuffed to chair, donuts served. </p>
<p>My proposal: lean into the wolf problem by using remaining public funds to provide the pack with bikes, preventing further robberies. Establish annual Lupine Grand Prix, a 250-kilometre one-day bicycle tour of surrounding area for wolves only, to replace spectacle of the County Fair. Town would become a mecca for beautiful cycle enthusiasts, and toilet paper reconciliation can remain. </p>
<div class="su-pullquote su-pullquote-align-left">
<img src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/SR23_Klassen_Bicycle_3.jpg" alt="Illustration of red stapler" class="alignnone pull-quote-image size-full wp-image-156713" />
</div>
<p>Policy team response is jubilant. They fling staplers into the air to celebrate before hoisting me on their shoulders. Mayor Ron looks cherubic; tears of joy wheel down his face. He insists we send a delegation to the wolves immediately and volunteers himself. We warily uncuff him. I am chosen to accompany Mayor Ron both because it is my initiative and also for the vague (racist?) notion that the wolves might prefer to speak to an Indigenous person. </p>
<p>It is decided we ought to bring a goodwill offering. All know the nicest bike in Town is an old Bianchi owned by local geriatric Peggy Marchand. After endless cups of tea, she agrees to part with the bicycle in exchange for a zoning amendment that allows her to bulldoze anything within a one-kilometre radius of her home if it can reasonably be described as “compostable.” Possible error in judgment, but our bladders are too full, and the celeste-blue Italian frame too beautiful, for any of us to care. </p>
<div class="smallcaps">AFTERNOON, FRIDAY, JULY 24</div>
<p>Mayor Ron and I prepare for our trek into The Park. Decide to wear my Métis sash wrapped several times around my waist to enjoy powerful support for my lower back, which is a serpentine disaster after years of desk work. Neither Mayor Ron nor I are worthy cyclists, so I carry the Bianchi behind me on a tumpline, as my voyageur ancestors did with their ninety-pound bales of fur when portaging. We enter from visitor parking once the sun has peaked, hungry to usher in a new era for the Town and fling away the dusty relics of the recent past. It is important to feel this way whenever you are about to introduce new legislation, lest the ghosts of history loom too large. </p>
<div class="smallcaps">EVENING, FRIDAY, JULY 24</div>
<p>Hard going initially. Mayor Ron insists on brainstorming the next instalment of his true-crime podcast and plots a multi-episode arc about the bicycle thefts. He wears a full suit and smokes incessantly. We head toward the centre of The Park with vague instructions on the wolf pack’s territory. These we had received from the rangers, still half feral from all the cane sugar and rolled oats they’d ingested. After a day’s hike, we have set up camp beneath the stars. </p>
<div class="smallcaps">MORNING, SATURDAY, JULY 25 </div>
<p>Terrible sleep. I dreamt that I hired the rougarou as my personal trainer. It wore a Lycra bodysuit and forced me to do endless squats. Cackled at my discomfort and my concave ass, before turning into a fanged Clement Forester. Awoke with startling violence before breaking camp. </p>
<p>We are nearing wolf territory. Mournful howls and the occasional tinkle of a bicycle bell set me and Mayor Ron on edge. The trail is full of rocks, inclines, and mud; the pedals of the carried Bianchi catch on sappy pine trees. Yet I am strangely content. </p>
<p>It has been years since I’ve journeyed this deep into The Park. Feel like I am not worried about anything for the first time since early puberty. Nothing I need to do except deliver a bike and grunt occasionally at Mayor Ron, who tells a story from his youth that involves making love to a stranger in a room full of fridge-sized computers during a tour of the Diefenbunker. </p>
<p>Without the minuscule tyrannies of cellphone reception and non-mayoral human contact to reinforce them, the small ruptures of selfhood that I fixate upon each day are revealed as irrelevant. Indigeneity doesn’t seem to matter anymore, and yet I have never felt more Métis. We walk for hours, The Park stripping away my neurosis like birch bark. God gives me a noogie and I am grateful. At one point, I yell loudly for the sheer joy of it, grit in my voice. There is a chorus of lupine howls in response, and Mayor Ron is annoyed I interrupted his erotic reverie. I do not care. </p>
<p>Thinking I will return in the future, barring wolf-based misfortune. </p>
<div class="smallcaps">EVENING, SATURDAY, JULY 25 </div>
<p>Still alive. Heading back to Town, alone. Halfway through the day, we had turned a corner of the trail to find a pair of huge wolves astride a tandem mountain bike blocking our path; one was so black the light turned its fur blue, the other a greyish white. A clacking sound of kickstands being deployed let us know we were surrounded by the lesser members of the pack. The Bianchi was the only thing that had stopped them consuming us, and I placed it before the alpha male and female as an offering, with words of acknowledgement and thanks using my limited Michif. My fear was an icy burn, and I stuttered a little. Mayor Ron, on the other hand, was entirely calm; he has no fear of death after decades of attending Town council meetings. He offered each wolf a cigarette before launching into my proposal to give them more bikes in exchange for taking part in the Grand Prix each year. Initial language barrier overcome by many gestures and creative use of cycling terminology, which all were familiar with. </p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2em;"><img src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/SR23_Klassen_Bicycle_4.jpg" alt="Illustration of two wolves riding a blue bicycle. In the background is a rock and tree branch." width="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-156714" /></p>
<p>The pack eventually agreed. Only two conditions: wolves must be permitted to apply for seasonal internships at Town Hall and, once per term, the mayor must spend a week living with the pack. Mayor Ron delighted to accept this cultural exchange and insisted that I leave him behind immediately. I gave him what supplies I could spare and reluctantly departed, worried that his podcast talk might compromise our fragile interspecies treaty. </p>
<p>Town will be listless without his antics. No one reminds us we are alive like Mayor Ron. </p>
<div class="smallcaps">EVENING, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 5 </div>
<p>Good news. Lupine Grand Prix an enormous success. No deaths and only a handful of maulings, not much more than original County Fair. Town is bloated with bicycle enthusiasts, news reporters, and the greasy heaviness of bannock. Wolves look gorgeous on their bicycles, handlebars dropped so low they appear to fly along the ground like Skittles cast from God’s own hand. All enjoy the spectacle, and I bathe in the Métis council’s good graces. Even Clement Forester admits he is having a good time. </p>
<p>Furthermore, we have had numerous successful toilet paper reconciliations since July, and no one else was as shitty about it as David Roads. The Métis council is hoping to incorporate the practice into the “Way of Life” PowerPoint it uses when giving talks at the high school. </p>
<p>Our new intern has been howling all morning with satisfaction at successful implementation of her event site plan. Only alteration made by Mayor Ron, who insists on placing the bratwurst shack dangerously close to the final leg of the course. This is for his own convenience. All are disgusted by Mayor Ron’s unseemly pleasure at consuming these German meats; globs of pickled cabbage drop to the floor beneath him like discarded Christmas tinsel, and everyone avoids the ketchup-stained stigmata on his hands afterward. </p>
<p>Shack location causes problems at one point during the race, as smell proves distracting to the wolf cyclists. An unidentified bichon frise is eaten in the ensuing fracas, but disaster otherwise averted by PA Emily wrestling the beasts back onto their machines. </p>
<p>Mayor Ron exchanges growls with the race winner, the blue-black alpha, who licks the ketchup off his hands. Mayor Ron has never shared the language he developed during his time with the pack because everyone refuses to call him “Alpha Mayor Ron.” </p>
<p>After the award ceremony, the wolves cycle back into The Park. The sun is low and golden as we stand and watch them clear the boundary line. They pedal into the forested trails, free in ways we cannot imagine.  </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/bicycle-race/">Dispatches Regarding the Woeful Origins of the Town’s Bicycle Race</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Émile said</span> it was the easiest birth he’d ever seen. “She just shot right out!” he said, and he punctuated the statement by slapping his hands against the steering wheel.</p>
<p>We were taking Pearl to meet Émile’s friends who also had a baby, only their baby was older; he was already being measured in excessive months. Fourteen months? There’s a whole year in there. Just say <em>one</em>. </p>
<p>“How many of those things have you seen, anyway?” I said. </p>
<p>“Two or three,” he said. “Once in health class in grade school, and once I watched one online out of curiosity.” </p>
<p>“And what about the ‘or three’?” I said. </p>
<p>“Can’t remember,” he said, and he lifted his chin to look at Pearl in the rear-view mirror. I liked the way Émile looked at Pearl, like she was the most important person on earth, even though I was a little nostalgic for when he looked at me that way. I couldn’t complain, though. Being looked at by Émile like I was the second most important person on earth was a miracle too. </p>

<p>I also loved how often Émile looked at Pearl. But sometimes I did wonder if checking on her so much meant that he wasn’t watching the road. <em>Proactive, not reactive</em>, he’d taught me when he was teaching me how to drive. Since Pearl’s arrival, he’d become a little reactive, flinching each time he caught a glimpse of movement in his peripherals, flipping other drivers the bird and saying, “The sign says ‘Baby on Board,’ can’t you read?” I worried he might become transfixed by Pearl one day and get into a crash and <em>kill us all</em>. It was perhaps a warning sign of psychopathy that I would even think the words <em>kill us all</em> about my family.</p>

</div>
<p><em>Family </em>still felt funny when I said it. Émile and I never called ourselves a family when it was just us two, even though, according to the law, that’s what we were. We always just said <em>us</em>. Now there was Pearl, and I was two people: a wife and a mother. I hadn’t figured out yet how to just be me again. </p>
<p>Émile was still Émile, and sometimes I was envious of him for that reason. He always did his half of everything around the house&mdash;I don’t mean it like that. But I envied him for having the choice. Fatherhood was an <em>opt-in</em> situation in some ways. If he decided to be a worse man, he could spend every night at the bar. I, on the other hand, had to get out of bed slowly each morning, or else I felt like my organs might all fall out through my vagina. </p>
<p>But that wasn’t his fault! The hormones make me dramatic. The doula told me not to even think about sex until I felt <em>good and ready</em>. </p>
<p>“If he wants it, he wants it,” she said. “That’s his burden to bear.” I did feel good and ready in my brain, but my body was wide open and raw. I wondered if I only felt I wanted it because I was worried Émile would stop thinking of me in <em>that way</em> if we didn’t start doing it again soon. If I thought too hard about it, I could feel a pain deep in my abdomen. It was like something had taken a big bite out of me. When I looked at Pearl, it was hard to believe she’d been such a violence against my body. She was so sweet smelling and pure. Plus, she was a near-silent baby. We’d only known her for three weeks, but so far, she was uncannily silent. She just lay around all day and looked out at the world with big bug eyes. If I got up close and kissed her cheek, sometimes she would make a small sound like a sigh. “I love you, P,” I would say when I kissed her. I kissed her all the time. I even told myself to resist one out of three times I wanted to kiss her so I wouldn’t go overboard. I didn’t want her to be coddled and develop a complex later in life. </p>
<p>“Don’t call her <em>pee</em>,” Émile said. “It might stick.” </p>

</ul>
<p>In the mornings, I liked to sit at the kitchen table with Pearl against my chest and tell her things I’d learned online. The sleep deprivation made it impossible for me to work or write, so instead, I spent a lot of time researching whatever came to mind. Most recently, I read about a shade of blue discovered at Oregon State University in 2009. </p>
<p>“It’s called <em>YInMn Blue</em>,” I told Pearl. “It’s the first new blue discovered in the last two centuries. The name comes from, um, let me think. Something, something, something, and manganese.” Then I kissed her cheek, and she sighed. </p>
<p>Émile’s friends were instructors at the same polytechnic institute where I worked. I didn’t know them until Émile introduced us, because they worked in science and I worked for the literary magazine in the creative writing department. Most days, I didn’t leave my office until it was time to go home. </p>
<p>I felt melancholic thinking about my office at the college. It seemed like by the time I was ready to go back to work, the whole place wouldn’t even be there anymore. Émile offered to go on parental leave as soon as I felt able to work again, but it just didn’t make sense due to the difference in our salaries. Émile got tenure at the institution not long before we found out I was pregnant. We tried to celebrate three weekends in a row, but every time we sat down for dinner, I’d puke. Still, it was an exciting development for him. Mine was what my father called a <em>career of passion</em>. It’s true I loved the job, but now I loved Pearl more than anything. Well, I loved Pearl and Émile exactly the same. It worried me, even, the fact that that was true. I knew Émile loved Pearl a little bit more than he loved me, which I thought was definitely the right thing. I just couldn’t pick one. </p>
<div class="su-pullquote su-pullquote-align-left">

<p class="pull-quote-SR23">I imagined, with each feeding, that I might become less of a mother and more of my <em>old self</em>.</p>

</div>
<p>Émile had a lot of love in his heart, and I didn’t need to be the only recipient of it. That’s why they promoted him so early in his career, because he cared about every student. All of them! One semester, an undergraduate student neglected to show up to lecture once, and on the last day of class, she emailed Émile and said that she was sorry but her anxiety had gotten the best of her. </p>
<p>“What do I do?” he said. He wondered this the whole drive home from his office, all the way through dinner, and so on. It kept him up at night. “I can’t fail her,” he said. </p>
<p>Throughout my pregnancy, my feelings for Émile changed in a way I couldn’t explain to him. It wasn’t any less or any more. “It’s just different,” I told him. “Like I’d strangle anyone who made you feel any kind of bad way.” </p>
<p>“You’ve always said that!” he said. “But now for real,” I insisted. “Like hands around throat.” </p>
<p>Once I met Pearl, I realized <em>that</em> was the way I loved Émile: like a mother. I learned on the internet that breastfeeding can burn up to 700 calories a day. Women reported feeling their stomachs shrink a little more each time their babies fed. I imagined, with each feeding, that I might become less of a mother and more of my <em>old self</em>. But when I saw the purple marks where my skin had stretched and the size of my bloated and painful breasts, I knew that to be a mother once was to always be a mother. Anyway, I didn’t want to go back. Not all the way. When I saw photographs of my old self, with bags under my eyes and a rib cage like a greyhound’s, I felt the same as when I saw photographs of my mother. Both of those people were dead. </p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">The friends</span> were Lucas and Marina. They lived in a townhouse just outside of the city with their baby and Marina’s mother, Tatiana. Marina’s father had died the very same day her baby was born, and that’s when her mother had moved in with her. Marina wrote a very beautiful announcement about the death and about the birth and posted it on Facebook. Émile and I read it over breakfast one morning, and we were both brought to tears. I think we each were thinking about our own fathers. Although they were complicated men, we didn’t want to lose them. Especially not now, with a new woman we wanted to introduce to them. (Émile and I love to call Pearl a <em>woman</em>. It never fails to make us laugh.) In a way, I felt, we were giving them both another shot at being good dads. </p>
<p>Marina’s mother answered the door with the baby on her hip. His name was Mordecai, after Mordecai Richler. It seemed funny to me to name a baby after a famous misogynist, but perhaps not everyone saw it that way. Mordecai was <em>fourteen months</em> old, and he looked more like a child than a baby. Looking down at Pearl in my arms, I couldn’t believe her size. She was like a little lima bean. </p>
<p>“Come in, come in,” said the mother. She turned swiftly, and Mordecai’s head bobbed. He watched me follow the woman into the kitchen, where Lucas and Marina were setting a small round table. Between their two seats was a high chair with old dried food spills on the tabletop. I promised myself then that I would never let Pearl’s high chair get like that, but I felt guilty for judging another mother, and I knew that that’s probably exactly how Pearl’s would end up looking. At the centre of the table was a big scalloped casserole dish that had some sort of pasta with broiled cheese and bread crumbs. All around the dish, like orbiting moons, were bowls of limp green vegetables, whipped mashed potatoes, sliced French bread. A small saucer of jam, one of butter, one of pitted green olives. On the kitchen counter by the sink: a German chocolate cake. There was so much food. I knew with certainty I wouldn’t be eating any of it. </p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2em;"><img src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/SR23_Klassen_Mother_4.jpg" alt="Illustration of four wooden chairs around a table with empty drinking glasses on top." width="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-156714" /></p>
<p>We were seated and served in a whirlwind. Mordecai whined and cried and hit his hands on the table. Marina looked at him the way a person looks at a painting in a gallery. I tried not to look at him at all for fear of betraying my inability to care about any child but my own. </p>
<p>“How’s it been?” said Lucas, loudly, to speak over the sounds of his son. </p>
<p>“Oh, you know,” said Émile. </p>
<p>Marina went to the kitchen and wrestled with her breast pumps. Mordecai’s increasing volume was causing her to hurry, which was unfortunately slowing down the process of sorting out the tubes. </p>
<p>In my adolescence, I would sometimes touch myself and think about a device similar to the breast pump, but somehow sinister and invented by aliens. I was always being abducted in the fantasies, I should clarify. The alien breast-pumping machines would be attached to my breasts and would pump forcefully until I began lactating, and I guess the aliens were harvesting the milk or something. I never got further than the lactation, and then if I hadn’t finished yet, I would more or less start the fantasy over. </p>
<p>“Do you pump?” said Marina, and I worried she’d been reading my mind. I shook my head. </p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking it might be a good idea,” said Émile. </p>
<p>“Oh yeah?” Midway through saying this, Marina lifted up her shirt. Of course, it was not in that way, but still I felt a twinge of aggression. <em>You’re just going to show him your tits?</em> I thought. </p>
<p>“Émile is only saying that because he’s a saint,” I said. I took two slices of bread from the dish and buttered them and placed them on my plate. “So he can feed Pearl while I go about my day.” </p>
<p>“Anyone should be able to go about their day,” he said, and everyone laughed at his display of saintliness. The joke was that he was playing it up and I was playing it up when I said what I said. Of course, <em>I do</em> think highly of him in earnest. </p>
<p>Marina turned on the pump, and it started to make a terrible noise. </p>
<p>Marina and Lucas’s was such a <em>baby house</em>. Our house never felt like this one with its plastic bins in pastel colours piled with plush animals and all of the small strange baby accessories on every surface. </p>
<p>“Save me some,” said Lucas. </p>
<p>Marina laughed. </p>
<p>“We do that too!” I said, turning to Marina, whose top was rolled up under her shoulders. She had a pump on each breast. </p>
<p>“What?” she said. </p>
<p>“The milk!” I said. “We drink it. We even made lattes.” </p>
<div class="su-pullquote su-pullquote-align-left">
<img src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/SR23_Klassen_Mother_3.jpg" alt="Illustration of a silver fork, knife, and spoon" class="alignnone pull-quote-image size-full wp-image-156713" />
</div>
<p>The metal ladle cut through the broiled surface of the casserole with a crisp sound like a boot through snow. I spooned a large portion onto my plate, and on top of that, I piled some arugula salad. </p>
<p>“What?” said Lucas. </p>
<p>“We made breast milk lattes,” I said. </p>
<p>Émile placed his hand very gently over mine, which in his language meant <em>shut the fuck up</em>. </p>
<p>Interacting with the food was making me feel embarrassed, and I hoped no one would see the mess on my plate. It was the wrong thing to do to keep talking, but I would rather be seen as a nuisance than a glutton. “Once we each ate a strand of the other’s hair,” I said. “Not Pearl’s, just each other’s. And when we first got together&mdash;well, this is how we got together, I guess I should say&mdash;we cut our hands and shook them. Like blood brothers.” </p>
<p>“Blood brothers,” said Lucas. </p>
<p>“A blood pact!” I said. </p>
<p>Marina’s mother looked at the baby like he might hear me and become upset by all of the blood talk. Marina came over and scooped him up and placed a bottle in his mouth. “Sorry,” I said. “Enough about all that!” I pierced the casserole with my fork and then lay the fork down on my plate. </p>
<p>Pearl struggled against my chest. I stroked one of her fat little arms, at the place where her elbow bent, where it was fattest. I loved all of Pearl’s fat. She had fat arms and fat legs and a fat little torso. Her face was fat and round like there was dough proofing around her features. She was stunning. </p>
<p>Marina very seamlessly changed the subject from the kitchen: “We found that our natural rhythm came back once he hit six months.” </p>
<p>Lucas’s mouth was full of food. He made a noise and nodded, with one finger in front of his mouth. This was a way of reserving his place in the conversation. We waited for him to finish. </p>
<p>He swallowed and said, “Once we could turn around and not worry he’d be gone when we turned back.” </p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ve turned around in three weeks,” said Émile, and everyone laughed. Émile was lucky to be occupying this role in the room. Or maybe he earned it by being normal and funny and not opening his big mouth all the time. </p>
<p>“Please,” said Marina’s mother. “Eat.” </p>
<p>Lucas and Émile picked up their forks. It was like Marina’s mother&mdash;Tatiana, forgive me&mdash;had inserted their batteries. </p>
<p>Lucas was explaining to Émile an experiment he was doing at work involving hunger and SSRIs in rats. Both Lucas and Marina regularly killed rats at work&mdash;this was how Émile had first explained them to me. “We do too,” I’d said, trying to make some sort of clever comment on authorship. Character as lab rat, you know. Émile had said nothing and checked on Pearl. </p>
<p>My plate was full. Domed, like a face looking up at me. Hot and oily and smelling of herbs and spices and the hormonal twinge of cheese. Some evil entity wanted me to let it inside of me where it could fill in all of my hollow parts and stretch me out. I moved some pieces of arugula around with my fork. The others were at least halfway through their meals&mdash;I’d never catch up. There was nothing I hated more than eating after somebody else had already finished. I hated eating to begin with, and I hated it even more in the presence of others. But eating <em>alone</em> in the presence of others? Complete horseshit. </p>
<p>I looked down at the top of Pearl’s head and felt remorse. Telepathically, I sent her an apology for her having chosen this planet, this city, this family, with a mother who hides bites of food in her napkin and calls things <em>horseshit</em>. I sent Pearl a lot of telepathic apologies. At night, while falling asleep, I would compose a <em>sorry list</em> in my mind and send it to her mind. E.g.: I’m sorry I became a writer and not a teacher or a social worker or some other profession that breeds kindness; I’m sorry I didn’t start to get better earlier so I’d be more prepared for you; I’m sorry you might grow up and get my nose, or the disease in my brain, or both. I didn’t want to say the sorry lists to Pearl out loud because I didn’t want her to grow up in a melancholic household. I tried to be joyful on the outside and keep the melancholy to the telepathic channels. </p>
<div class="su-pullquote su-pullquote-align-left">

<p class="pull-quote-SR23">A certain amount of compassion is given to new mothers no matter their displays of instability.</p>

</div>
<p>One year had passed since the wedding and one year since I started to gain weight. There was a whole new wardrobe in the closet, all cotton dresses and linen slacks and big knit sweaters and sweatpants with elastic waists. Then I got pregnant. Who knows how I would have handled the weight gain if it hadn’t been for anyone. It seemed easy to imagine gaining weight for the baby and then losing it all and being my old self again. </p>
<p>I felt I could do anything for Pearl&mdash;even eat. But then here I was with a plate of untouched food. </p>
<p>“Congratulations, by the way,” said Lucas to Émile. </p>
<p>“On what?” said Tatiana. Thoughtfully, she placed an olive in her mouth. She was fairly slim, the mother. Could I be that way? Could I eat the olive and still be slim? </p>
<p>“Tenure!” said Marina. </p>
<p>“What does that mean?” Another olive. Mesmerizing. </p>
<p>“It means he can’t get fired,” said Lucas. </p>
<p>Émile said, “That’s not true,” in a very kind voice, to Tatiana. </p>
<p>“I’m going to go change her,” I said to Émile, hoping he wouldn’t look at my plate. Perhaps enough time had gone by that he stopped watching me the way he used to. “And maybe feed her too.” </p>
<p>I knew that restricting food would affect my milk supply. Pearl’s milk supply. That was all she ate! If I didn’t eat, she didn’t eat. Imagining my milk drying up because I was starving again made me want to kill myself. But I couldn’t kill myself because I had to protect Pearl for as long as I lived and I had to be a good wife to Émile and try to make him happy. I don’t mean <em>make</em>. I mean do my best and hope for the best. Yadda yadda. </p>
<p>Standing over the table gave me a view of all of the food at once. It was breathtaking in its beauty. Marina and Lucas and Marina’s mother had put all of it together. They’d sliced the bread, shaved the butter into curls, steamed vegetables, grated cheese, baked a <em>cake</em>! For Christ’s sake. </p>
<p>Pearl’s fat little arms were straining toward my plate. I was holding her face out so she could take in the beauty of the spread. I lifted a slice of buttered bread and let her smell it. Who knows if she smelled it or cared. To her, it was just another object in the room. So I ate it. </p>
<p>Then I took Pearl into the bathroom and had a brief cry. I turned so I wouldn’t accidentally confront my reflection in the mirror. So much food had gone into my body in twelve months. I couldn’t help but feel it all in there, like it just kept piling up. Every day, every meal. Even if I <em>wanted</em> to go back, how would I ever get there? It seemed like I could fast for the rest of my life and, at eighty years old, I’d still be working off a risotto from last week. It was obvious, I felt when I came out, that I’d been crying in the bathroom. No one said a thing for a moment. A certain amount of compassion is given to new mothers no matter their displays of instability. Lucas smiled at me the way he must have smiled at Marina when she acted unstable. Something that happens to husbands when they become fathers is they start treating all women like wives. It’s good, I think, because when they’re just husbands, they treat women like delicious French pastries. </p>
<p>I was starving. My apologies to the men of the world&mdash;the French pastry thing came out of my own desire. </p>
<p>“If you want some privacy,” said Marina’s mother, “you can feed her on the balcony.” “Thank you,” I said. It was relieving not to have to take part in any more of the conversation. I did like hearing about the hungry rats, but I knew when it came time for me to contribute, I’d mess things up again. </p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">It was a beautiful day</span> in early September. The leaves hadn’t turned yet, but they would soon. Lucas and Marina’s balcony was on the first floor, elevated a foot or so off the ground. It overlooked a courtyard where there was a garden and a bench and a small bird bath. Living in that townhouse, overlooking that courtyard, eating olives and buttered bread, what more could a person want? </p>
<p>With Pearl on my breast and the smell of the change of the seasons, it seemed everything might be all right.</p>
<p>I looked in through the French doors and saw Émile and Lucas and Marina and Tatiana eating and talking. That was what it was all about, I thought. </p>
<p>I hadn’t noticed a man on the neighbouring balcony, smoking a cigarette. He was sitting in a sagging canvas folding chair with his legs spread open, and he was looking at my bare breast. The other was covered by Pearl, who was having a meal. I knew if I looked back at the man, in the eye, he would pretend not to have been looking at me. But I was too shy. “Drink it in,” I said.

After he and the bedding were removed, the small black and white photograph lay alone. The words “my mother” were written on the back. The pencil marks defied time and left the family with a challenge of epic proportions. </p>
<p>The man’s eldest son pocketed the photograph and did not share it with his siblings. It took another twenty years for him to reveal it, and then, he only showed it to his son. This son worked in advertising and was a gifted photographer; he was given to retouching photographs as if he were painting. Under his hands, the woman’s face remained untouched, but her clothing, hands, and ornamentation all went through something of a transformation as he made copies for various relatives. Before long, different members of the family had variously come to believe or disbelieve in the photo and its significance.</p>
<!-- Widget Shortcode --><div id="custom_html-47" class="widget_text widget widget_custom_html widget-shortcode area-arbitrary "><div class="textwidget custom-html-widget"><div class='_form_1'></div><script type='text/javascript' src='https://thewalrus.activehosted.com/f/embed.php?static=0&id=1&6557B05928F22&nostyles=1&preview=0'></script></div></div><!-- /Widget Shortcode -->
<p>The family itself became scattered all over the world. After the Partition of India in 1947, the younger generation of this particular Kashmiri clan settled not only in Pakistan but in Europe and North America. The photograph was brought along with other documents and records by various members from one country to another. Many third-generation members of the family had copies of the photograph placed in albums and had forgotten about it. It never generated a dialogue among the ten granddaughters of the woman in the photograph. It was as though this generation’s memory had been wiped or a prohibition placed on talking about it. </p>
<p>One woman passed by the enlarged, framed photograph daily in her home. This woman, Nina, known to be a sentimental aesthete, spent months searching for the right frame in which to display the picture. She settled on a stunning Italian Renaissance design whose beauty complemented the subject. The frame was only thirteen by sixteen inches, but it made viewers linger as they gazed at it. </p>

</ul>
<p>Of all the objects in her art-strewn home, Nina took a sense of reassurance from her own history. Yet this framed photograph of a young woman who could not have been more than nineteen or twenty when it was taken continued to exert a hypnotic effect on her, and she began to feel that it was not a one-way street. It felt like a case of the watcher being watched. The resolute expression on the face of the young woman was astounding for its time period. This apple-cheeked beauty with jet-black eyebrows, which slashed her forehead and created a border for her eyes that blazed with an unspoken fury, made her stare back, resolute with an emotion. She used her eyes like an X-ray machine. Nina wanted to get inside this face and touch its real history. </p>
<p>When the woman embarked on a search for the origins of the photo, she was met with resistance. Finally, an octogenarian niece of her mother’s released some information about the story of the woman in the photograph; she was her maternal great-grandmother. Nina clung to the fragments of information she received and placed them in the vault of her memory, as if storing gems. </p>
<p>As the story went, when her great-grandfather, who was a lawyer and enjoyed a good fortune from his land holdings, visited a home ten miles away from the city, he was led to a formal sitting room. His host offered refreshment, and he was intrigued by the sound of a voice in the adjoining room. This voice, and the Persian words that entered the room through a gauzy curtain, wrapped around his senses as though he had been submerged in a pool of silky water. He was mesmerized both by their proximity and the unseen voice. He was already married and the father of five children, yet he left that home obsessed. Within days, he indicated to this family that he wished to marry the young woman who recited Persian verse so beautifully. As he was a man of substance and personal wealth, his offer was accepted. </p>
<p>It was late one night when a sound awoke Nina in Toronto. The hum of the central air conditioning normally prevented sound from entering her bedroom. She started and knew immediately she had not been dreaming. It was the sound of a song. She walked into the living room wondering if her music system had started up on its own. Yet no sound emerged from that area. In this late summer night, moonlight flooded through the floor-to-ceiling windows which led to the balcony. She walked slowly, coming closer to the wall where the portrait hung. She leaned down and switched on the lamp which sat on a small ornamental table close to it. She looked up out of habit. The frame was empty. </p>
<p class="pull-quote">She raised the palm to her lips, and her tongue told her it was salty. A tear had been shed, she was convinced of it.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">E</span><span class="smallcaps">very year</span>, for three months, the girl’s favourite uncle came for a visit. He had fought for her education and taught her everything about Persian poetry. The girl was bright and grasped sufficient vocabulary of Persian, although Urdu was the language of the region. She was encouraged to recite for her father, who smiled with pride. By the time she had reached the age of fifteen, marriage proposals started coming for her, but her two elder sisters had to be married first. She didn’t care as she climbed trees in the big garden of the house and draped herself in her mother’s shawls and created little pageants out of speeches and poetry. In the summer, her fair complexion reddened with the sun; her dark, long hair framed her face; and her eyes sparkled. Her thick, straight, jet-black eyebrows forced attention to her face. Four years later, when she was informed that a proposal had been made and accepted, and that her husband-to-be was an educated lawyer, she was disappointed; at nineteen, she wanted her life to continue just as it was. There was something about living with a stranger in a different home that seemed disturbing; however, she had to keep these thoughts to herself.</p>
<p>This man, who had aquiline features and light hazel eyes, sent ropes of pearls fashioned as a necklace and long, delicate pearl earrings studded with tiny rubies, along with a set of ivory brocade clothes, for the wedding. Her mother was appalled at the restrained shade of the clothing and made her wear a deep crimson outfit instead. When the girl signed her marriage contract, her fingers trembled; the man leaned forward and steadied her grip on the pen. She had not looked up at him from under the ornate head-covering fabric but felt immense gratitude for this gesture. He had saved her from embarrassing herself and her family. A fragrance floated from him which intrigued her. She was only familiar with the essence of rose that she wore. Waiting for them outside was a strange conveyance: a car festooned with strands of jasmine, in which he settled her in the back seat before taking her away. The engine started, surprised her, and she clenched her hands. Seated beside her, the man chuckled softly and forced her hands to release their tension, and she was shocked by the intimacy. </p>
<p>The house he took her to was in the inner city. It was built around a large central courtyard but had no garden. A staircase spiralled from the ground to two upper floors and the rooftop. The room he ushered her into on the second floor had a big bed, which was decorated with garlands of flowers, and a magnificent carpet. Covering almost the length of one wall was a gleaming teak armoire for clothes. The girl had never seen anything like it. On an ornate dressing table lay his set of hairbrushes with wooden handles, flanking a bottle of sandalwood. That was the scent lingering in his clothes. The other, empty side was for her things. A double set of windows opened out from the room, and all that could be seen was the central courtyard below. She was then led up to a rooftop terrace, where flocks of pigeons sat around the ledges. A bird cage on the terrace held two parrots, and another had a pair of nightingales. There were three clay containers which held flowering plants. The girl’s spirits lifted a little when she saw the jasmine bush and a miniature blooming wild rose as well. </p>
<p>When the man brought her back inside from the terrace to their room, he moved closer and playfully slid her head covering off.</p>
<p>“I wanted to see your hair, Inam. How long is it?” </p>
<p>He had used someone else’s name. But there was no one else in the room.</p>
<p>“I have changed your name. It will now be Inam. A prize. Because that is what I feel about you.”</p>
<p>The girl promptly burst into tears. Her own name was gone, as was the garden she had grown up playing in. She hated birds in cages. She felt that this man was making fun of her. She knew there would be physical intimacy in the bed and was frightened. Perhaps the tears would repulse him and he would leave. Instead, he pulled out a white handkerchief from the pocket of his long wedding tunic and, making her sit on the edge of the bed, gently wiped her tears. So she continued to weep and he continued to smile as he dabbed her face.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smallcaps">ack in Toronto</span>, Nina stood aghast, looking at the empty frame. She blinked furiously. A chill overtook her body in spite of the night’s warmth. Was it a mind game? The minute she had seen the empty frame, she had looked at the floor hoping when she looked up again, the frame would not be empty. She sought refuge in humour. Perhaps the young girl had gone for a walk and would return. Perhaps people in photographs were imprisoned and often they found a way to simply walk away. Nothing could induce her to look at the empty frame itself again. She had loved the girl in the photograph for years and felt she lived with her. </p>
<p>Nina had recently taken up the practice of vinyasa yoga. Through its slow pace and meditative breathing techniques, she had found that vinyasa could lead to an altered state where physical dimensions dissolved. One particular posture could make her relax to the point that she felt she was having an out-of-body experience. Now she lay down on the carpet and held the pose and began a breathing exercise. From her forehead to the soles of her feet, all physical tension vanished. Her outstretched arms and legs created the sensation of being weightless. Suddenly she felt a drop of moisture fall on the palm of her outstretched right hand. She raised the palm to her lips, and her tongue told her it was salty. A tear had been shed, she was convinced of it.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">nam sat</span> at the dressing table trying to coil her hair into a chignon at the nape of her neck. It was a tedious exercise, but her husband had requested that she do this. It suited her better than a tight braid dangling along her spine like an animal’s tail. When Ismail tucked a sprig of jasmine or a tiny rose on one side, her reflection in the mirror did not displease her. She thought she looked like the women in Persian miniature paintings. But still, she fought each new ritual this odd man who was now her husband eased her into. He had a gentle authority and graceful manners which confused her. </p>
<p>When she released the pair of nightingales from their cage, he had simply sighed and said, “Now you will have to sing twice a day, as the birds sang twice a day.”</p>
<p>She blushed at the suggestion, but he just laughed uproariously. He had asked her if she could cook, and she told him she had never been interested. He suggested that she visit the ground-floor kitchen and observe the cooking. She was expected to cook on special occasions. “I want to eat what is cooked by your hands.”</p>
<p>Inam found his ardour flattering and yet unsettling. He often took small trips away, which she assumed were related to his work, but when he returned, she could not stay the quiver of excitement that rippled through her. She would prepare a special dish for him. Often it was a dessert. He created a ritual out of making her try the first spoonful, offering it to her as though a parent feeding a child. As though all the fuss was for her and not him. There would be gifts which he would produce like a magician. A fountain pen with a bottle of ink and sheets of loose cream-coloured paper just appeared on her side of the dressing table. </p>
<p>“I have had a small table and chair placed on the terrace,” he said one day. “You can write poetry there in peace.”</p>
<p>The day Inam learned her status as a second wife, from an elderly maid in the house, she was so shocked that she could not utter a word. Her thirty-eight-year-old husband had already been married for fifteen years, had five children. He had been maintaining two homes. Inam never recited a single poem for him after that day. His gifts to her lay unused in the teak armoire. Silently, she would give birth to their two sons in sequence, repressing the fury which raged within her. She was scared it could flavour the milk in her breasts. Her contact with her own family became minimal and strained. In arranged marriages like theirs, decisions were made by a bride’s parents. A second marriage was not uncommon. But her pride was shattered. She had given four years of her youth to this man. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">N</span><span class="smallcaps">ina woke up</span> on the carpet in her apartment. The bizarre night and the fact of having actually fallen asleep in shavasana confounded her as she opened her eyes. She looked up at the wall, and the young woman with dramatic eyebrows gazed back at her from the frame. So it had been a dream. Her imagination could no longer be trusted. </p>
<p>Later, she pulled out a file folder from her papers. Inside was a hand-drawn family tree. It started with Ismail. Then Nina rifled through an album of photographs. Against a range of both fashionable and traditional clothes and poses portrayed by the women of her family over a century, no one else’s clothing or accessories resembled those of Inam, the second wife of Ismail. </p>
<p>She looked at the photograph more closely. Women in the late-nineteenth century did not pose boldly, as Inam had: the cascading earrings made of flowers and the ornate rings and bracelets on the long-fingered hands folding over an elaborate necklace flowing down her chest. The pose itself, of one ankle crossing the other as she stood leaning against a chair, could have been that of a contemporary model. She also wore the kind of heavy anklets and shoes associated with dancers. </p>
<p>The cousin who had enlarged and circulated the photograph was dead now, and when Nina had questioned his wife about the photograph being retouched, the woman had vehemently denied this. An extended family treasured this image of a great-grandmother. So she backed off. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">here was</span> a psychiatrist Nina consulted from time to time, and he had always encouraged her to be in touch whenever she needed to.</p>
<p>“It was late at night. Was the frame truly empty? Did you have any alcohol or take a sleeping pill that night?” the doctor asked when she told him the story. He was bent over his notepad, writing.</p>
<p>“No. I was wide awake. I was stunned and then frightened.”</p>
<p>“Frightened? Why?”</p>
<p>“It was outside the limits of reality. Perhaps even supernatural.”</p>
<p>He jerked up his head and gazed at her. “You mean a hallucination? Or did you just imagine this? What is your relationship with this photograph?”</p>
<p>“I think we both watch each other,” Nina blurted out.</p>
<p>“Photographs are inanimate material not known to have physical movement. But you know that,” he said, smiling. It was like the time she had called him Merlin because he handed magic spells to her. </p>
<p>She gathered her thoughts. The doctor waited for her to say something that would drive the session along. </p>
<p>“I have a close link with the woman in the photo through my grandfather. She was his mother. So it’s there. I think the photograph has been retouched; today we would call it photoshopped. I think it is fake. She is not fake, though.”</p>
<p>“What do you think guided the person who did this?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Nina said. “He was a photographer. He is no longer alive. It’s a dead end.” She felt desperate for the doctor to unravel her mind, her behaviour, and the story. </p>
<p>When she got home, she stood in front of the photograph, still back in its frame, and did not move for a while.</p>
<p>“Is this a fake photograph? Did someone choose these clothes for you? Royal courtesans of the Mughal era dressed like this. Was this just your husband’s fantasy?” she asked the impossibly beautiful face.</p>
<p>The eyes gazed back without revealing anything.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">nam was heavy</span> with her second pregnancy. The daily antics of her older son, who was three, exhausted her. Ismail had brought a special pair of baby shoes for the boy, Siraj. He told her they were replicas of shoes made by English shoemakers. They would keep the ankle firm and had excellent support. It was her duty to ensure that Siraj wore them daily despite his penchant for crying and kicking them off. </p>
<p>Ismail was absent from the home more often now. When he returned, he brought fine gifts. Inam, wise to her status, wondered if the gifts were indications of a guilty conscience or genuine affection. She did not have the courage to confront him outright, and he never shared details about his other family with her. These troubling questions crystallized into a knot of pain. Gone was the laughing girl who had so enchanted her husband. Like the missing nightingales, the sweet strains of her gentle conversation went away. She was growing older and bitter. Yet, in front of Ismail, she behaved as was expected of her. She had become a model wife and was now a mother. A small hutch was built on the terrace for a pair of rabbits her toddlers played with. Instead of reading poetry aloud, she experimented with writing a story of her own but remained uncertain about her narrative. She did not share this pursuit with Ismail. </p>
<p>When Ismail was home, she worked at embroidering a tablecloth. If he was disappointed in her, he did not reveal it; instead, he read to her from a large, heavily illustrated book containing the work of the poet Rumi. She was stunned at the reach of the words she heard. She did not realize that this work, <em>Dīvān-e Shams</em>, had been inspired by a work compiled by Rumi for someone he loved who had died suddenly and mysteriously. Ismail had chosen its words of love and longing wisely. He thought, perhaps, that as she listened to the quatrains of longing, she would return to him. </p>
<p>After her second child, a son called Miraj, was born, she avoided physical contact with Ismail. She was angry and felt he did not understand how she, a favoured and pampered child of her own family, could be humiliated as she had been. Would he marry again if he tired of her? When Ismail reached for her, she turned limp and was unresponsive, and her puzzled husband did not force her. Instead, he held her gently. To Inam, her husband had also become someone else. Yet the bonds of this marriage were traditional and older than each of them. She had given him two sons and maintained a comfortable home, so she had not shirked her duties. He had given her status, comfort, and beautiful sons. Inam felt very strongly that there was no convention that dictated that she had to share what was in her heart with him or anyone else. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">N</span><span class="smallcaps">ina embarked</span> on a trip from Toronto to the city where Ismail had brought Inam as his bride. The old section of Lahore still existed. Ismail’s courtyard home had an intact ground floor, but the upper two floors were in ruins. An elderly family member who lived in Lahore consented to escort her, amused by her great interest. The relative said Nina was at least a hundred years too late. The home was a ruin, the family no longer owned the property, and some very poor relatives lived in the two rooms on the main floor as squatters. These people did not mind visitors. Nina walked through a laneway which would only permit space for a bicycle or for two people to walk side by side, the houses to either side blocking all but a filter of sunlight. </p>
<p>Finally, she reached a wooden door with some embellishments that had turned dark with age. Crude plaster covered the walls to either side of the brass-accented door. On one side, a chunk had fallen off, and a sliver of red brick was visible. The sight of this three-inch scar in the brick electrified her. The home had withstood time, and Inam’s history had not perished. </p>
<p>Inside the darkened vestibule, a man greeted her, and she resisted his entreaties to bring her farther inside and stepped out into the courtyard. Here the sun shone on the pitiful, ruined two upper floors. Only windows remained, shaped like conical archways. The roof had fallen. She wanted to see the ghosts of her great-grandparents recite Persian poetry in this courtyard. She wanted to hear Inam’s bracelets and anklets tinkling and the sound of singing nightingales. The man with her kept repeating, “There is nothing here. The municipality sends notices to demolish it, but we manage in the two rooms. We don’t let them inside. But we will have to go soon.”</p>
<p>“There was a woman, my great-grandmother. She came to this house,” Nina said and could feel tears gathering in her eyes. </p>
<p>It was obvious this man had no inkling of the history of the family that had owned the place. </p>
<p>“My wife has made some tea for you. Please come inside,” he said, tugging at her arm. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">nam knew</span> that Ismail had something in his mind. He told her he was expecting his nephew who had returned from studying in Germany. Preparations had to be made. She was to be dressed formally. Then he went to his side of the armoire and brought out two velvet boxes. The old maid was to take both the boys to the rooftop and keep them there. Inam knew that her older son, Siraj, would be happy playing with the rabbits, but the younger one, Miraj, clung to her and disliked the maid. Ismail bore his stern, authoritarian air, the one he used in court. Inam knew she could not disobey him. Hearing her younger son’s wail pierce the house as he was carried away, she hated Ismail. There had been no time to give the maid any lumps of gurh, the brown sugar confectionary studded with nuts which both her sons loved. </p>
<p>Ismail placed the boxes on the bed and told her to open them. Inam was quite stunned to discover that the first one held an ornate necklace with medallions of pure gold shaped like leaves. The second box contained heavy anklets as well as gold bangles and rings. The jewellery blazed like a king’s treasure in the bedroom. </p>
<p>“I want you to wear clothes over which this jewellery will sit well&mdash;wear white,” he said and walked out of the room. </p>
<p class="pull-quote">He thought, perhaps, that as she listened to the quatrains of longing, she would return to him.</p>
<p>Inam was curious about the jewellery. She put on the necklace and the heavy anklets and stepped onto the carpet by the bed. The oval-shaped mirror above the dressing table only showed her head and shoulders. Was he taking her to a wedding? It was clear there was a purpose to this. What was so important about this nephew? </p>
<p>She draped a length of diaphanous white fabric over the back of her hair and over her shoulders. The ornate necklace with decorative medallions flowed over her chest. She slipped on the rings and bangles, but there were no earrings in the box. She knew she could remedy this and, lifting the strands of jasmine from a saucer of water on the dressing table, threaded them around her earlobes. The effect was dramatic; the flowers cascaded down, brushing her cheeks. The brocade shoes with turned-up toes were big for her, but she slipped them on her feet anyway.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, Ismail returned with his nephew. Both men were transfixed. </p>
<p>“Please let her stand. Maybe against the chair,” the nephew said, pointing to the narrow chair with a cane seat and a simple curved frame. He was holding a camera.</p>
<p>“Inam,” said Ismail, “let’s make you immortal. Now you will never be forgotten.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">N</span><span class="smallcaps">ina only spent</span> twenty minutes in the ruins of the house. Although she longed to go up to the second floor, the stairs had disintegrated. The terrace no longer existed, brought down with the roof when it collapsed. And so she left her ancestral home and returned to Toronto as her project also collapsed. Back in the penthouse, she moved the framed portrait of Inam into an alcove. She had found the trip and the endless speculations around it to be exhausting.  </p>
<p>That was until a call came from a prominent poet from Pakistan. He told her he had an anecdote to relate about her grandfather, Siraj, who had been a literary critic in Sialkot. He also wondered if she had any copies of her late grandfather’s works of poetry. She told him over the phone that she did have a few xeroxed copies. It was becoming a lengthy phone conversation. His last comment was intriguing.</p>
<p>“Your grandfather held a literary salon in Sialkot,” the elderly poet said. “Poets recited their work and your grandfather presided. He was quite instrumental in promoting poetry and always thanked his mother for that.” </p>
<p>Then he chuckled. “His father was a lawyer and, apparently, quite notorious.”</p>
<p>“Notorious? Why?” </p>
<p>“Well, there was some scandal about a courtesan he married and kept hidden.” </p>
<p>“She was never hidden.” Nina chose her words carefully. “Come for lunch tomorrow and I shall introduce you to her.” </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-photograph-1889/">The Photograph, 1889</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Ever since childhood, words would desert Helen when she got angry&mdash;if she felt any kind of strong emotion, really]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="1320" src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Coady_TheMoney_CelesteColborne_1200.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="" /><p><span class="dropcap">“W</span><span class="smallcaps">hy do you</span> say yes to everything?” asked Helen, peering backward into the bathroom mirror. Her back looked as if she had been attacked by giant leeches. Like she’d been running for her life and they fell upon her, attaching their suckers to her spine, her shoulder blades, leaving large, perfectly circular hickeys. And she had just lain there face down, as if paralyzed, and let it happen. That part of it was true, actually. </p>
<p>Ernestine had told her that cupping was her new thing. She had been reading up on it, she said, and Helen’s body and its particular needs had popped into her mind. Helen couldn’t help it&mdash;she liked hearing about popping into Ernestine’s mind. It made her feel cared for. That was the reason Helen had transitioned from taking Ernestine’s yoga class Saturday mornings to coming in Wednesdays as well for a bodywork practice called redirective therapy. Ernestine said, one Saturday, as Helen unrolled her mat, “You know, I have been thinking about that wonky shoulder of yours. Make an appointment&mdash;I might have a trick that can help.” Helen, who had a chronic hip thing but hadn’t even known about the wonky shoulder, said yes.</p>
<p>Ernestine flounced into class in neon-pink tights and oversized tops with proclamations on them like <em>JOYFUL</em> or interrogations like <em>WHAT are you GRATEFUL for TODAY?</em> And the tops were always elaborately spangled, which you didn’t often see with athletic wear, but apparently Ernestine possessed some kind of crafting device that allowed her to bedazzle all her clothes.</p>
<p>For most of her life, Helen had avoided flakery. When her physio first advised she try yoga, she went out of her way to find a class that defied every possible cliché. She found one in midtown that was run out of a kickboxing club by a former junior hockey player named Gary with a perspiring face. He called it “kick-ass yoga,” and he always opened class by shouting: “<em>Who here is ready to get their ass kicked?!</em>&thinsp;” And the participants were supposed to scream back at him: “<em>Sir, yes, sir!</em>&thinsp;” Helen thought this was great until she noticed that every class, when Gary would cue them into happy baby pose, he’d make the same joke, which was: “<em>Or, as I like to call it, happy husband pose!</em>&thinsp;” None of the women lying on their backs and hanging onto their feet ever laughed at this. But Gary kept making his joke. </p>
<p>So Helen started looking around for other classes. Ernestine was flaky, but her flakiness was so extreme and insistent that it struck Helen as honest in some objective way. It didn’t feel trendy, like a vibe Ernestine had picked up from social media. It seemed essential and unselfconscious, like she had soaked it up in the womb. Whenever she came bounding into the studio on Saturday mornings, it felt like someone had thrown open a set of heavy curtains to let in the daylight&mdash;the proverbial ray of sunshine. </p>
<p>And it wasn’t like Ernestine didn’t know how she came across. She was often apologetic about what she called her “intuition.” Every once in a while, while pulling and twisting Helen’s limbs this way and that, she’d let something slip about Helen’s “energies,” which Ernestine indicated she was “picking up on.” Then she’d chuckle self-deprecatingly and say, “Sorry if that sounded a little wavy-gravy.” But Helen didn’t mind. Yoga people were supposed to be that way. Gary had been fun for a couple of classes, but Ernestine was a far better teacher, her classes more meditative and uplifting. And, as for the bodywork, Helen always left Ernestine’s table feeling better, lighter. And that other thing&mdash;cared for. Ernestine would pull Helen’s arm one way and then the other, across her body, then above her head, murmuring to herself as if deep in contemplation. She’d place a hand on Helen’s hip, let it sit for a moment, then shift it, gently but decisively to one side, and exclaim, “That’s the money!” It made Helen feel understood in a way that she didn’t even comprehend herself. </p>
<p>The cupping bothered her, though. The furious, identical circles emblazoned across her back, like she’d been branded. Ernestine had said, “I just wanna try something out on you, okay?” And Helen had said yes. Yes, because she was there on the table, blissed out, feeling Ernestine’s hands radiating warmth and compassion into her muscles, listening to Ernestine’s murmurs and cooing. And saying no would have ruined it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Coady_TheMoney_CelesteColborne_400x260_Spot-1.jpg" alt="A rainbow patch that reads JOYFUL" width="400" height="260" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-151650" />
</p>
<p>It seemed to Helen that she didn’t used to be such a pushover. During corpse pose at the end of her classes, Ernestine would play music that sounded like wind chimes, over which she’d utter a stream of platitudes that Helen just tried to ignore, because if she didn’t, she thought she might snicker. But, once, Ernestine had murmured something about how important it was to “hold yourself in kindness,” and Helen, who had been drifting contentedly up until that point, had thought, <em>How inane</em>, and then burst into tears. She sat up, and Ernestine was at her side, enveloping her, ushering her swiftly to the back room, where her massage table lived.</p>
<p>“Yoga brings up so much,” Ernestine told her, rubbing her back. “And, Helen, you hold on to so much. Can I say that? You carry so much.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps"> woman named Dana</span>, who Helen didn’t know, reached out to Helen through her university email address. The message was brief and uninformative, asking only if they could set a time to speak on the phone. Helen scanned and then deleted it, because at the bottom of the message, Dana identified herself as “Assistant to Nicola Rasmussen,” which to Helen’s mind was like identifying yourself as assistant to the ocean&mdash;or Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Then Dana left two or three voicemail messages, also through the university, which were easy enough to ignore. “If she calls again, just tell her to fuck off,” Helen told the secretary. “It’s an angry student or something.”</p>
<p>The secretary was aghast. </p>
<p>“No, no,” Helen amended. “I mean it’s someone trying to prank me. She says she works for Nicola Rasmussen.”</p>
<p>The secretary blinked at the famous name, then laughed. “It could be legit! Maybe she wants to star in a movie about your life!”</p>
<p>Helen grinned and looked down at her own chest. The secretary grinned back. They were both thinking the word the whole world associated with that name, which was “tits.” </p>
<p>“Yeah&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;I can’t see it,” said Helen.</p>
<p>“Poetic licence!” chuckled the secretary. “The magic of Hollywood.”</p>
<p>Helen tried to imagine a movie about her life starring Nicola Rasmussen: Corpse Pose <em>is a lush cinematic feast about a large-breasted woman with noticeably hard nipples crying at yoga</em>.</p>
<p>But, the next day, Nicola called Helen on her cellphone.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n her films</span> Nicola Rasmussen played women you couldn’t trust. She joked about it in interviews&mdash;these were the only roles anyone would give her. Nobody saw her as a faithful wife or devoted mother or a frazzled lady scientist peering into a microscope, frantically searching for ways to save humankind. </p>
<p>She started out famous in a basic sort of way, for being stunning and young. But she “exploded onto the scene,” as the saying went, because of the nipple business. A-list actresses didn’t usually show their breasts in those days, but Nicola Rasmussen not only showed her breasts on screen, she <em>did</em> things with them, like smoosh them together or cup one breast in one hand and the chin of some man in the other, who she would then draw slowly to her. But the real detonative moment happened when Nicola’s breasts were completely covered&mdash;albeit by a sheer material. She caressed, and then flicked, her left nipple with one manicured finger, making it harden in real time, right there on camera, on the big screen. She became an instant object of cultural loathing and celebration as a result, and that had never quite gone away. It had been decades ago, but when her name came up, people still found it funny to call her <em>Nippla</em>. </p>
<p>“I’ve been trying my hand at poetry,” said Nicola Rasmussen when Helen spoke to her on the phone.</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Helen. “Wow!”</p>
<p>“I think I might eventually have something.”</p>
<p>“I see. Huh! Like&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;a book?”</p>
<p>“Well, Helen. This is why I reached out to you. Only you can tell me if I’ve got a book on my hands.”</p>
<p>Nicola Rasmussen had somehow got a hold of Helen’s twenty-two-year-old sophomore poetry collection. The book had gone nowhere and done nothing other than provide a line on her CV, which may or may not have helped Helen get the job she currently had. Helen had garnered a lot more attention for her first story collection but understood now how much of that had come from the fact that she’d been a twenty-something woman with an intriguing author photo. Her boyfriend had taken the picture at two in the morning at a hookah bar. Helen had her head thrown back and was releasing a stream of fragrant smoke into the air above her. Her fingers looked extralong and poetic, twined around the pipe, fingernails painted black. Massive earrings, shitloads of eyeliner. She’d looked decadent and squalid, like a lady poet should. <em>Wow</em>, people used to say, when they flipped the book over and beheld Helen’s expanse of exposed white neck. Her publisher, Melanie, who was also her publicist because she ran the whole (now defunct) publishing imprint as a one-woman show, had told her the photo hinted at a story of some kind, like a Hopper painting, and that’s what people responded to. They bought the book hoping to know more of Helen’s story. </p>
<p>“I’ll bet 50 percent of your sales came out of that author’s photo alone,” Melanie had said. </p>
<p>“Huh,” said Helen. “Three whole books!” She was cynical and impish and dark back then. She certainly didn’t do yoga. She took long, intense walks that sometimes lasted four or five hours, during which time she would smoke several cigarettes. But, by the time she’d published her second book, the one that had so captivated Nicola Rasmussen, she’d had to quit smoking because it triggered her migraines. And the issue with her hip came about from walking for hours in bad shoes.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">E</span><span class="smallcaps">rnestine came</span> racing into the studio wearing a tights and bra set that was covered with rainbows. She whipped off her bedazzled top (which today read <em>Grace</em>) so everyone could admire the outfit.</p>
<p>“Running a yoga studio is not always easy,” she told them. “But there are perks! I get outfits like these offered at a discount!”</p>
<p>Helen thought it was the kind of pattern that might have been sitting in the discount bin anyway, but of course it looked natural and right on Ernestine, who turned around and raised her muscled arms and flexed her extraordinary buttocks, making the rainbows shimmer.</p>
<p>“I am really trying to focus on this kind of thing lately,” Ernestine confided to the class. “Things that delight me, that give me joy. Little things. It doesn’t have to be a material thing, it doesn’t have to be something you buy. But if that’s what gives you joy, what the heck! Focus on it! Don’t focus on the furnace!”</p>
<p>The furnace in the studio kept shutting down in the middle of class and had been doing so throughout the winter months. Ernestine had started encouraging students to “bring lots of layers,” which Helen and the other diehards had obediently done. Some even wore fingerless gloves. Ernestine herself had started bringing a woollen cap with teddy bear ears to class for the very bad mornings when the furnace had shut off at some point during the night and the studio felt like a walk-in freezer.</p>
<p>But Ernestine always put on a happy face. She cultivated gratitude and joy all winter long. “You’ve heard of hot yoga?” she’d declare to her bundled attendees. “Well, today we’re doing cold yoga!” And then she’d pull a pair of spangled sweatpants on over her tights.</p>
<p>Then, in the spring, Ernestine became more ebullient than ever because she had found a yoga boyfriend. Helen knew from their conversations during bodywork that Ernestine was divorced, that her ex was a bad man&mdash;bad in ways she didn’t get into but that Helen could guess at, having a bad ex of her own. Ernestine hinted that custody arrangements regarding her little girl were an ongoing trial because of this man’s stubborn selfishness. Ernestine often talked about the travails of being a “single mom and small business owner”&mdash;how demanding the two roles were, how easy it would be to get overwhelmed if not for her regime of fitness and wellness and cultivating joy.</p>
<p>But, once the boyfriend had been acquired, Helen realized that Ernestine had in fact been putting on a brave face through much of the winter. She talked a good game, speaking of her gratitude and her health-giving routines and her vast love for her daughter and her work and for Helen and all the diehards who showed up for yoga on Saturday mornings. But to compare Ernestine then to Ernestine now&mdash;it was like she’d been uttering her winter-long affirmations through gritted teeth. Because now, in the springtime of her yoga boyfriend, Ernestine actually glowed, she beamed, bouncing from mat to mat to give instructions during class, sometimes impulsively embracing Helen and the others as they balanced and strained, planting a nurturing smooch on a random shoulder or the back of someone’s head once she was finished adjusting their postures.</p>
<p>She had met the boyfriend on some kind of retreat, and Helen had yet to catch his name. He was long haired with a Christlike centre parting and beard, always smiling gently, showing wonderful teeth. As a couple, they gave off a giddy air of all-consuming sexual infatuation. Helen found it disconcerting to be in the studio with them. The boyfriend would join the Saturday morning classes&mdash;he and Ernestine tumbling into the room like puppies, pawing and nipping at each other. Sometimes, when everyone was seated in a cross-legged position, Ernestine would rise like a sleepwalker, go over to her boyfriend, and wrap her arms and legs around his shirtless torso in a full-bodied embrace. </p>
<p>“I’ll be honest with you. I had a pretty hard winter,” Ernestine confessed one day in the treatment studio as she guided one of Helen’s legs straight into the air and pushed it back toward her head.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have known,” said Helen. “You always seem so positive.”</p>
<p>“That’s because there’s no reason not to be positive,” murmured Ernestine. </p>
<p>“Was it the furnace?”</p>
<p>“Yes, the furnace. I was so relieved when the weather finally warmed up. I don’t know what I’ll do next winter, but that’s a worry for down the road. And my daughter, you know, she’s a tween now&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;”</p>
<p>Ernestine went quiet for a few moments, becoming lost in Helen’s quadriceps. Helen felt them loosen, and then everything else seemed to loosen along with them. Her eyelids fluttered, and her mouth fell open.</p>
<p>“She wants <em>stuff</em>&thinsp;!” exclaimed Ernestine. “Like, out of the blue. Her father took her snowboarding at Christmas. Now all she talks about is snowboarding next year. She wants all the gear. And she doesn’t want to go sledding anymore, which I think is so sad, because I love sledding! You don’t have to be a kid to love sledding. But she says it’s lame.”</p>
<p>Ernestine fell silent, and Helen blinked at the ceiling, dozy. “But now things are looking up,” she ventured.</p>
<p>“Exactly,” said Ernestine. “And that’s my point. No matter how hard things get, the most unbelievable joy is always around the corner. You just can’t lose faith. Faith is like an ember&mdash;you have to blow on it! You can’t let it fade!”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> <span class="smallcaps">day later</span>, Helen heard herself repeating the ember thing into the phone to Nicola Rasmussen. She was so nervous and, after an hour and twenty minutes, was struggling to find something to say that seemed like the words of a serious and deep-thinking person. You’d think a line of actual poetry might’ve popped into her head, maybe a snippet of Mary Oliver&mdash;always a crowd pleaser. Or any one of the authors she’d spent the last decade reading and talking to students about. But no. She quoted Ernestine.</p>
<p>“What does that <em>mean</em>?” Nicola Rasmussen demanded. “How am I supposed to <em>blow</em> on it?”</p>
<p>They sat and talked another two hours as a patch of afternoon sunlight slid from the upper corner of the wall into a warm, square puddle at Helen’s feet. What threw Helen wasn’t that Nicola wanted to talk for so long&mdash;it was more that all she wanted to talk about was death. Helen didn’t know what she had expected going into this, their first official “work” call, but it hadn’t been that. Nicola had not yet sent Helen any of her writing to read. At the outset, Nicola asked Helen to consult with her about her poems&mdash;to perhaps become her editor if Helen thought there was a book there&mdash;but added that she wanted to have “a good talk” with Helen first to explain what it was she was trying to achieve. Helen said that sounded okay by her, so they booked this second call, which at first seemed like it, too, might be businesslike. Nicola picked up precisely where they left off, bypassing small talk, and explained to Helen that her poems were about her mother, “who I adored. Who I worshipped my whole life.”</p>
<p>An empty notebook page stared up at Helen from the table, so she wrote on it: NICOLA’S MOM. “I think that sounds lovely,” said Helen. She had a sudden memory of a magazine cover that featured Nicola&mdash;back in the late ’90s, one or two years after the nipple furor. Nicola had faded into the background during that period, as it was widely felt she should, but this cover&mdash;likely timed to promote a film&mdash;had been some publicist’s notion of a cheeky nod to the controversy. <em>NICOLA RASMUSSEN: SUPERNOVA OF SEX</em>, read the headline. She’d been wearing a gown that looked to be made of disco balls and stood with her head thrown back the way Helen’s head had been thrown back in her hookah photo, arms extended, backlit in such a way that her golden body seemed to exude light. Both nipples were prominent.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t lovely,” said Nicola, “because my mother died from Alzheimer’s in a nursing home, and she didn’t recognize anybody for two years before her death. Every day she would wake up and look around in horror, not recognizing anyone or anything, terrified, thinking she had been abandoned by everyone who loved her.”</p>
<p>“Oh my god,” said Helen. </p>
<p>“And I’d come to see her and I’d say: ‘Mommy, it’s me, Nicki.’ And if I had just said to her, ‘Hi Mrs. Rasmussen, I’m Doris or whatever, your designated visitor today,’ that would have been less traumatizing for her, but instead she’d stare at me and start screaming, ‘What have you done with Nicki? Where’s my daughter Nicki?’ Then she’d just start screaming my name: ‘NICKI! NICOLA!! NICKI!!’ While I’m right there sitting in front of her and there’s nothing I can do to console her, to convince her I’m there, because as far as she’s concerned, I’m one of the horrible strangers who is keeping her captive and torturing her by pretending to be her daughter. And then she just died one afternoon. I’d brought her some muffins, and she threw a fit and shoved them off the plate onto the floor, and she just died, thinking and feeling all those things. Calling my name at the same time as she was screaming at me to get away from her.”</p>
<p>“Oh my god,” said Helen again.</p>
<p>“So I’m trying to write about all that,” said Nicola. “That’s what I need help with.”</p>
<p>Helen’s plan for the summer otherwise mainly involved researching a paper that would, ideally, get her accepted to a conference in Barcelona next year. But all she really needed for that was an abstract, so she told Nicola she would help however she could. Then she dug out her old reading copy of her second collection, bulging with old yellow Post-its. It had been published so long ago that she found it hard to remember how she’d been as a person then, what her life had felt like. She took a look at the pages she had always chosen to read in public and read a few out loud to herself, trying to spark old synapses, remind herself of their writing, and then, hopefully, detect whatever the thematic and emotional currents were that had sparked with Nicola. </p>
<p>She was relieved to find that she liked the poems&mdash;they weren’t naive and callow, didn’t have any of the qualities for which she had typically berated herself when she was young. It was the work of a person obsessed with fleeting moments and impressions, who spent hours trying to resurrect them on a page. Helen found she could kind of admire that person, how tireless she had been. The way she’d decided that this weird project&mdash;attempting to capture the ineffable and then fixing those attempts onto a piece of paper like a specimen of insect&mdash;was so important it should take up all her time and mental energy.</p>
<p>Then again, that person didn’t have much better to do. That person didn’t yet have a perpetually aching hip or a crippling course load or aging parents. She hadn’t yet met the person she would move in with and, eight years later, file a restraining order against. Really, she didn’t know how good she had it all those years ago, dawdling over her PhD, losing days in the library, student loans a worry for down the road&mdash;a future <em>worry</em> for this person, this Helen, to deal with. She hadn’t even suffered much by way of loss at that point, except for the family dog being hit by a car when she was fourteen&mdash;which was, admittedly, awful. And, of course, the death of grandparents. But everybody lost their grandparents. In Helen’s intro poetry class, she was regularly besieged by dead grandparent poems. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">E</span><span class="smallcaps">rnestine wrapped</span> her hands around Helen’s ankles and gently pulled. Helen loved everything about the exercise&mdash;the feeling of space it created in her hip sockets, the feeling of Ernestine’s strong, warm hands wrapped around her lower legs. Helen had a brief fantasy of levitating above the earth. Drifting helplessly upward into god knew what. Ernestine taking hold of her ankles just in time, beaming up at her, gently guiding her feet back toward the ground. </p>
<p>Then Ernestine released her ankles and moved midway up the table to push down with either hand on Helen’s hips.</p>
<p>“Oh boy,” said Helen.</p>
<p>“That’s the money,” Ernestine agreed.</p>
<p>There was a spell of humidity that summer, and the studio was stifling even for morning classes. Ernestine arrived to class carrying what looked like a large pickle jar filled with yellowy sludge. To Helen, perspiring on her mat, it looked like humidity in a jar. Ernestine explained that the sludge was bone broth and unscrewed the jar lid and took intermittent sips as she set up her mat at the front of the room. “It’s so good for you,” she told them.</p>
<p>Helen noticed that Ernestine hadn’t bounded into the room the way she usually did. A woman with a thick black ponytail&mdash;someone Helen felt companionable toward because they always seemed to set up their mats alongside each other&mdash;must’ve noticed Ernestine’s subdued energy too. The ponytail woman asked if Ernestine was feeling under the weather.</p>
<p>“It’s a low-energy day,” said Ernestine. “We all have them! That’s your body saying: <em>Pamper me! Baby me!</em>&thinsp;” She sipped her yellow muck. “So we’re going to have a gentle, low-key practice today.”</p>
<p>Someone else asked where Ernestine’s boyfriend was today. No one felt shy about asking these kinds of questions because Ernestine overshared as a matter of course. She had told them about her ex-husband’s erectile dysfunction and her daughter’s sexual precociousness and the incontinence issues she’d had to deal with after the daughter’s birth. “I’m the queen of TMI!” Ernestine would declare. But, this being a low-energy day, she merely waved her hand. “He’s at his cabin this weekend.” Helen knew that the boyfriend’s cabin three hours outside the city was not a place he just went to unwind and be in nature every once in a while&mdash;some middle-class urbanite’s cabin. The boyfriend had built the cabin himself. He lived in it full time&mdash;or had done until he met Ernestine.</p>
<p>“It’s all part of self-care,” Ernestine explained with respect to the missing boyfriend. “Sometimes you need a little space.” She raised the jar, toasting them like she was hoisting a pint of Guinness, then shoved it against the wall, causing the muck within to slosh. “You need ‘me time,’” she continued, scratching the side of her neck. “To focus inward.” That was when Helen noticed the large patch of flaky red skin creeping up from Ernestine’s collarbone&mdash;the scratching had caused it to glow brighter.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smallcaps">riting poetry</span> was also about focusing inward, which was maybe why Helen had done so little of it over the last couple of years. She joked about that during her calls with Nicola, which, now that classes had resumed, took place on Wednesday afternoons, when Helen didn’t have to teach. But Nicola, it turned out, had no patience for such jokes.</p>
<p>“Helen, I hate it when women beat up on themselves.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m just kidding,” said Helen.</p>
<p>“I used to be self-deprecating all the time,” said Nicola. “I thought it made me cute and relatable. I’d say, <em>Oh I’m such an idiot. Oh I don’t know what I’m talking about</em>. And then I started to notice that no one was arguing with me. They’d just smile and nod as if to say, <em>Yup&mdash;assumption confirmed</em>.”</p>
<p>Helen started to protest that she wasn’t being self-deprecating, exactly, she was just admitting to a certain fearfulness that had begun to make sitting down and thinking about anything that wasn’t right in front of her&mdash;exams to be marked, grades to be submitted, taxes to be filed&mdash;feel like too much of a heavy lift. It wasn’t self-deprecation, she wanted to explain, it was self-care. It was <em>letting go</em>, like Ernestine was always encouraging her to do, be it bad thoughts or muscle tension. Nicola thought Helen had been berating herself for not writing poetry anymore, but really Helen was just acknowledging that she didn’t want to. </p>
<p>Because imagine being Helen as she was back then, writing the poems that comprised her second collection&mdash;just sitting around wallowing in all that contemplation. <em>Now let’s think about dying. Let’s think about the War on Terror and the Highway of Tears and the serial killer with the pig farm. Let’s think about cruelty and indifference and the essential impossibility of connecting meaningfully with another human being. Let’s spend the prime of our lives doing that</em>.</p>
<p>Helen didn’t get around to saying any of this, however, because Nicola was now narrating a memory of some acting teacher who used to SCREAM at Nicola whenever she gave any indication of feminine self-effacement.</p>
<p>“She’d SCREAM at me if I cast my eyes downward, and she’d SCREAM at me if I smiled too much, and she’d SCREAM at me if I giggled nervously, and you can imagine I was doing a hell of a lot of nervous giggling around that lady.”</p>
<p>“What would she say?” asked Helen.</p>
<p>“She didn’t say anything, she screamed.”</p>
<p>“She’d just scream in your face?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Nicola. “She would scream in my face.”</p>
<p>Helen always felt relieved when Nicola wanted to talk about something other than her own poetry. But she always came back around to the poems, speaking of some as if they were already written and of others as if they were still in her head. Helen couldn’t always tell which was the case, she only knew that Nicola talked about them incessantly but still hadn’t sent Helen anything to read. The best part of the calls was when one of Nicola’s long, grim tangents would unexpectedly feature a twinkling glint of Hollywood lore. Once, Nicola had been talking about losing one of her best friends to AIDS, rushing to his bedside but not being allowed to see him and having to comfort his boyfriend outside the hospital because the boyfriend wasn’t allowed to see him either, and the boyfriend ended up killing himself shortly after Nicola’s friend had died. The call had strayed over the two-hour mark again, and Helen was lying on the floor of her kitchen watching the patch of sunlight make its slow diagonal crawl across the wall when suddenly Nicola pivoted and started griping about a man she happened to be sleeping with during that period, an Oscar-winning director, someone whose films Helen had seen. Helen sat up, electrified, and Nicola treated her to a twenty-minute exposé of the famous director’s multilayered sexual dysfunction and emotional impairment. </p>
<p>Helen kept hoping something like that would happen again, but the aspects of Nicola’s life that were most interesting to Helen seemed least interesting to Nicola. “I have nobody else to talk to about this stuff,” she’d say as she wrapped up an anecdote about a conflict with the nurses at her mother’s long-term care home. They had apparently taken Nicola’s mother’s call button away because she pressed it incessantly. So Nicola kept finding her mother, in this posh institution for which Nicola had paid through the nose, in various states of neglect&mdash;soiled or thirsty, her skin gouged from where she had scratched herself with nails that hadn’t been trimmed or even cleaned. One time, Nicola arrived and her mother casually handed her a turd like it was a keepsake pebble from the beach. </p>
<p>“You’re the only one who wants to hear about it,” she told Helen.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smallcaps">elen arrrived</span> for bodywork again, and they began, as they always did, with Helen standing, facing Ernestine, a few feet of distance between them, so that Ernestine could assess Helen’s body. </p>
<p>“You’re all out of whack,” she said after a moment. “It’s like someone sort of picked you up off the ground by your right shoulder and kind of dangled and shook you for a bit, and now the right half of your body is higher than your left.”</p>
<p>Helen lay down on her stomach, and Ernestine lightly placed her hands on Helen’s shoulders. </p>
<p>“Aw!” Ernestine exclaimed, as though someone had let her down.</p>
<p>“Oh no,” said Helen. “What did I do now?” She chuckled as Ernestine pushed more firmly on her shoulders and leaned over to whisper.</p>
<p>“Helen, you didn’t do anything wrong. You know that, right?”</p>
<p>Helen stopped chuckling because a lump had manifested in her throat.</p>
<p>“You’re feeling low today. You’ve got a lot on you. Sometimes we stop being in tune with our bodies. Our brain decides it doesn’t need that connection, that it can just operate independently. And the brain sort of leaves the body behind&mdash;and then everything falls apart!”</p>
<p>Helen started to relax, and the lump lessened. </p>
<p>“You’re someone who is very in her head,” said Ernestine, who was now sort of wobbling Helen’s hamstrings.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Not great in here,” said Helen.</p>
<p>“Especially today,” murmured Ernestine.</p>
<p>How did Ernestine know? Helen hadn’t arrived red eyed or blowing her nose, hadn’t been dragging her feet. Helen, as far as she knew, was the same as always&mdash;except for, apparently, her body being wildly out of alignment. But Helen’s younger sister, Wendy, had called the night before, not long after a marathon call with Nicola. And Helen knew she had to take the call this time. Wendy was angry Helen had not visited over the summer. And she’d been emailing all month about wanting to speak on the phone and making it clear what she wanted to discuss&mdash;that their father had started peeing in his chair and was refusing to talk about it.</p>
<p>At first, Helen told herself, in the name of self-care, that she should delay this conversation, because it felt big and she had her hands full with her job and this absorbing new project working on poetry with famous movie star Nicola Rasmussen. But then the calls with Nicola started hitting Helen in the same way her sister’s emails were hitting her, like a hard finger poking her in the windpipe&mdash;a thing her ex used to do when poking her in the shoulder didn’t do the job. The calls with Nicola started to feel like counterparts to Wendy’s emails, somehow, as if Nicola and Wendy, from their opposite poles of Helen’s life, were in touch, in cahoots, working together to nudge Helen toward the same pit.</p>
<p>On the phone, Wendy told Helen that their father would silently get up, change his pants, put some towels down in the chair when he returned, and sit back down. It was more domestic labour than he had ever performed in his life and the total extent of his acknowledgement of what was going on. “Remember,” said Wendy to Helen, “when you went off to school? And I joked how my greatest nightmare was being left behind to look after Mom and Dad when they got old and senile?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Helen.</p>
<p>“Well, guess fucking what?” said Wendy.</p>
<p>“How is Mom?” Helen had asked after a moment.</p>
<p>“Mom,” said Wendy, “is a whole other conversation.”</p>
<p>“Can I suggest an exercise for you, Helen?” said Ernestine, after Helen had dressed and was lacing up her shoes. Helen braced herself, because Ernestine’s exercises mostly required holding her body in unnatural positions for excruciating amounts of time.</p>
<p>But, instead, Ernestine asked, “Do you ever write?”</p>
<p>Helen secured her shoelace with a double knot and straightened up. “Do I <em>write</em>?”</p>
<p>“Like, journalling,” said Ernestine. “Or inspirational thoughts? Or poetry?”</p>
<p>“Sometimes,” said Helen.</p>
<p>“It can be so therapeutic,” said Ernestine. “I was feeling anxious the other day. And I said: <em>I’m just going to write down all the things that are making me anxious!</em> And you wouldn’t believe how open my hips felt afterwards. So I’m going to share with you what I did. Try writing, like, a dialogue. Get your favourite pen and some nice paper&mdash;I have paper that smells like strawberries. And first, you write what’s bothering you, whatever’s at the heart of your anxiety. Just get it all down on your nice paper. Then you reply to yourself as love.”</p>
<p>“I reply as what?”</p>
<p>“As love. Just love. If love was a person, what would love say? How would love respond to you?”</p>
<p>Helen stood a moment. “Okay,” she said.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smallcaps">ELEN</span>: </p>
<p><em>I think I have systematically shut myself off from all the people I’ve ever cared about, and anyone I might have the potential to care about, because I would rather not feel pain. I’ve tried pain voluntarily the way you watch horror movies to try out fear but then when you feel actual fear, you’re like, Yikes, no thank you, and that is how it’s been re: pain, both psychic and physical. When I say I tried pain voluntarily, what I mean is I feel like I have courted it somehow in my writing when I was younger, and even though at the time I thought I was doing the MOST IMPORTANT AND MEANINGFUL THING IN THE WORLD, now I think that maybe I was being ignorant and careless, like a teenager who drinks and drives because she believes she is immortal. And then I think what if the thing I have devoted my adult life and a good portion of my youth to actually amounts to a kind of pathetic dabbling, what if it wasn’t daring or bravely artistic at all but yet another way of shutting myself off from people while telling myself I’m very busy doing the MOST IMPORTANT AND MEANINGFUL THING IN THE WORLD? And instead of embracing actual relationships and human feelings, I was embracing bullshit chimeras and counterfeit grief without realizing I didn’t have to bother because the real thing was just around the corner?</em></p>
<p>LOVE: <em>Wow</em>.</p>
<p>Helen looked at the page. She put her pen down, shook the cramp out her hand, and picked the pen up again. </p>
<p>But that was all that Love could think to say.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="smallcaps">eptember passed</span>, and Nicola emailed to say she was coming to town at the end of October. She had a friend who was acting in a one-man show, and she was going to get tickets and buy Helen dinner and then take her to the play. </p>
<p>For the first time, Helen wished she had told someone about what she’d been doing all these months&mdash;so that she could now announce that Nicola Rasmussen was taking her to dinner and a show without sounding unhinged. Nicola’s fame was of the sort that caused people to unravel&mdash;to imagine she was their antagonist, or their lover, or that she was sending them coded messages in her movies. It was literally a maddening level of fame. </p>
<p>Helen had a game plan for the meeting. She would insist that Nicola finally show Helen some of her poems. It had been months of Wednesday phone calls, and at the end of each call, Nicola would say: <em>I’ll send you something by the weekend</em>, and she never did. At one point, midway through one of Nicola’s long, awful memories of her mother, Helen blurted: “I would really encourage you to get this down on paper. I mean, if this is the stuff you really want to write about. But you know what? It’s okay if it’s not.”</p>
<p>Nicola seemed blindsided. “Of course it’s what I want to write. Why else would I be here?”</p>
<p>“It just seems like a fraught topic for you,” said Helen. “You know, writing doesn’t always have to be therapy.” </p>
<p>“Oh I’ve done therapy, believe me,” said Nicola. </p>
<p>“But that’s not what your work has to be is what I’m saying,” said Helen.</p>
<p>Nicola paused, which was unusual. She hardly ever paused. “This is my subject matter,” she insisted. “It’s painful. But I have to confront it.”</p>
<p>“But what if you let go of that?” Helen was aware on some level that these words would be taken as heresy. But they were almost into hour three of this particular call, she was starving, and she had nothing in the house. She had planned to order noodles, and now noodles, glistening with soy sauce and sesame oil, were all she could think about. “Writing can be play,” she ventured, thinking about noodles. “Really, it is play. The idea that it’s anything more&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;maybe that’s what&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Poetry is the most serious thing in the world to me,” Nicola said in the booming stage actor’s voice she hauled out whenever she felt that Helen needed correcting. “<em>Deadly</em> serious.” The words travelled from Nicola’s diaphragm into Helen’s ear and silenced her&mdash;silenced her because they’d made her angry. </p>
<p><em>If it’s so serious</em>, she thought, <em>why don’t you try actually writing some?</em> </p>
<p>But, ever since childhood, words would desert Helen when she got angry&mdash;if she felt any kind of strong emotion, really. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t was a</span> sunny and beautiful autumn day, but it stopped feeling that way once Ernestine arrived. She was wearing a slouchy pale pink top that read <em>LOVE &#038; LIGHT</em>. She also wore her knitted cap with the teddy bear ears and kept it on as she unrolled her mat at the front of the room. But it wasn’t cold in the studio, and it wasn’t a cold day outside either. </p>
<p>“Hi,” said Ernestine, without making eye contact with anyone. Usually, she swept her beaming gaze around the room the moment she arrived.</p>
<p>She plopped down on her mat and adjusted her body into a cross-legged position. Helen was bothered by her posture. Ernestine looked off-kilter today&mdash;one of her knees sat slightly higher than the other. Then again, Helen wasn’t one to talk&mdash;she was sitting with all her weight on one butt cheek because the opposite hip was killing her. Normally, Ernestine would notice something like that and ask her about it&mdash;maybe run and get Helen a bolster from the shelf in the corner.</p>
<p>Everyone watched Ernestine in silence. She sighed. She’d brought her backpack to the mat with her and now unzipped and started rifling through it. “Some mornings are easier than others, guys,” she said into the backpack.</p>
<p>A couple of women said quietly how true that was.</p>
<p>Ernestine pulled out a tube of something and then yanked off her <em>LOVE &#038; LIGHT</em> sweatshirt. The blotch of red that Helen had previously noticed on Ernestine’s neck had crept toward the opposite collarbone and was encroaching onto her chest.</p>
<p>The woman with the black ponytail gasped.</p>
<p>“It’s eczema,” Ernestine told them. “Kind of out of control right now. It happens when I’m under stress.”</p>
<p>She began to slather lotion from the tube onto her blotches. There were blotches on her arms and elbows, too, and Helen saw, as Ernestine rubbed her hands together, that her fingers looked as if they had been dipped in boiling water.</p>
<p>“We don’t have to do this,” Helen heard herself saying. Everyone turned to her. Helen knew she had spoken too loud for a yoga studio&mdash;she had spoken like an affronted Nicola, from her diaphragm. Ernestine looked at Helen, scratched her neck, then realized what she was doing and made herself stop.</p>
<p>“We could all just take it easy today,” said Helen. A few women on nearby mats began to nod. “We could just&mdash;lie back. Do corpse pose.”</p>
<p>“Oh Helen,” said Ernestine. “If I lie back now, I might never get up again.”</p>
<p>She tried to laugh&mdash;a grinding, squeaky sound, like a rusted bike chain. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smallcaps">elen sat in</span> the hotel restaurant for twenty minutes as the waiter kept returning to smile and fill up her water glass. Finally, she got a text from Nicola: <em>Where are you? I thought you were here?</em></p>
<p><em>I am here</em>, wrote Helen. <em>Are you here?</em></p>
<p><em>Yes, I’m here!</em></p>
<p><em>I can’t see you. Where are you?</em></p>
<p><em>In the corner by the fake fireplace.</em></p>
<p>Helen looked around. There was no fake fireplace. She texted this to Nicola, wondering if her nerves and general apprehension had sent her into some kind of fugue state. They had confirmed it was the right hotel, in the right part of town. So it was here or nowhere. But maybe it was nowhere. Maybe, thought Helen, the last few months had been an elaborate catfish and her initial assumption, that a disgruntled student was playing a prank on her, had been correct all along. It was an apprehension that had never quite gone away during their weeks together on the phone.</p>
<p>Or what if Helen was, in fact, the thing she’d been worried people would assume of her if she ever mentioned Nicola? One of the maddened? That almost seemed more likely to Helen now, as she sat alone, with the waiter shooting her pitying smiles every time he passed her table. What if Helen had beheld Nicola’s face in some old movie on late-night TV last spring and something about her glossy early ’90s perfection had caused Helen to lose her grip? </p>
<p><em>In the basement</em>, texted Nicola.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the stairs was the entrance to a pub called The Bulldog, and Nicola had found herself a secluded and fireplace-adjacent corner within. The gas fireplace generated real, if overly uniform, flames. Flames like soldiers&mdash;side by side, identical, obedient to the twisting of a knob. Nicola was twisting that knob as Helen sat down, making the flames swell, then shrink.</p>
<p>“They told me I could fiddle with the fireplace as much as I want,” she told Helen. “I’m always too hot or too cold.” </p>
<p>They sat and smiled at each other. Helen realized she was starving. “I’m so hungry,” she told Nicola. They ordered food.</p>
<p>It was difficult to sit across from Nicola and not think about the way she looked. Helen couldn’t imagine it as anything but an inconvenience. How it must have been in the way her whole life, tripping Nicola up, like having one leg longer than the other. They chatted about the city as they ate&mdash;Nicola had lived here in her twenties&mdash;and then the school where Helen taught&mdash;Nicola had attended a year of an undergraduate program in drama before realizing the best thing she could do for her acting career was to leave Canada as soon as was humanly possible. Helen leaned forward, thinking this comment might lead into a few glamorous stories of twenty-something Nicola taking Hollywood by storm, but instead Nicola started talking about a sound poet she’d met the following year in New York who didn’t wash as a rule and never wrote anything down and also refused to allow anyone to make audio or video recordings of his work. He always said he wanted to appear and then disappear without leaving a trace, which Nicola said was ironic, because you could go into a room he’d exited hours ago and still smell him there. Nicola said she had followed him around Berlin for the better part of a year, but the sound poet was elusive&mdash;“That was his whole thing! In art and life! Being elusive.” So she never really got anywhere with him. On the upside, she did end up developing a deep appreciation for the city and its arts scene at the time.</p>
<p>A waiter in a Union Jack waistcoat noiselessly removed their plates as Nicola plunged into a rhapsodic memory of Berlin in the late ’80s. But Helen had made a deal with herself that she would say what she planned to say as soon as they were finished eating. “At this point,” she interrupted, “I’d really love to see some of your work.”</p>
<p>“At this point?” repeated Nicola. “You mean right now?”</p>
<p>“No, no,” said Helen. “I just mean&mdash;soon.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Nicola. “I’m planning to send you something early next week.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Helen. “Then maybe we should postpone our next call until after I’ve taken a look?”</p>
<p>Nicola paused. She looked at her the way Ernestine had looked at her when Helen suggested they all just lie back in corpse pose for the duration of their ninety-minute yoga class.</p>
<p>“But why would we do that? I find our calls so fruitful.”</p>
<p>“Because I feel like we’re not really getting anywhere,” said Helen.</p>
<p>Nicola sat back in her chair but held Helen’s eye. “Well,” she said, “I’m actually glad to hear you say that.”</p>
<p>“You are?”</p>
<p>“Yes. And I’m wondering why you think that is.”</p>
<p>“Because,” said Helen. “You won’t show me anything.”</p>
<p>“But why is that, Helen?”</p>
<p>Helen frowned. </p>
<p>“For months you’ve been listening to me bare my soul,” said Nicola. “I’ve told you all about my heartbreak with my mother, what I went through with my family . . . I don’t think there’s anything about me you don’t know at this point.”</p>
<p>Helen was nodding. Was Nicola commiserating with her? “I know!” she said.</p>
<p>“And so,” said Nicola, “why aren’t we at a place where I can trust you yet?”</p>
<p>Helen sat blinking. Nicola explained that a thirty-year acting career allowed a person to develop a razor-sharp intuition for how others are feeling. She was especially good, she said, at intuiting “resistance.”</p>
<p>It seemed like an Ernestine thing to say. <em>I’m feeling some resistance</em>, she’d whisper, wobbling a knuckle into a knot of fascia. <em>Breathe through it, Helen.</em></p>
<p>“But the more I open myself up to you,” said Nicola, “the more you seem to close yourself off.”</p>
<p>Helen could feel the language centres of her brain beginning to flicker, like a modem about to go offline. “I sat there,” she said at last. “On the phone with you. For months. Listening.”</p>
<p>“And yet I’ve somehow never felt that you were <em>with me</em>,” said Nicola. “Why is that, Helen?”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">n early cold snap</span> had occurred, and the treatment room was freezing. Even though Ernestine always began each session by swathing her in a heated sheet, Helen found it impossible to relax. The warmth of the sheet couldn’t penetrate the morning chill.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Helen,” said Ernestine. “I can’t use a space heater in here because I’ve already got one running in the studio space for my next class. If I use two at once, it blows the fuse.”</p>
<p>Ernestine worked on Helen in silence for a while. She was wearing her hat with the teddy bear ears again, and now Helen knew why she had barely taken it off in the last few weeks. She’d yanked it off briefly to scratch her head not long after Helen arrived, and Helen had seen a patch of bare scalp.</p>
<p>After several minutes of silent, chilly bodywork&mdash;during which, every time Ernestine manoeuvred one of Helen’s limbs out from underneath the sheet, she would shiver&mdash;Helen asked Ernestine how things were going.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve finally had a diagnosis from <em>Doctor Gerry</em>,” she said. “Which I think explains why I’ve been feeling so poorly the past couple of months.”</p>
<p>Ernestine had said Doctor Gerry with emphasis, as if Helen would know who he, or she, was.  </p>
<p>“Toxins,” she continued. “They’re in everything. Nickel, in particular. Oh my gosh. You wouldn’t believe how bad nickel is for you.”</p>
<p>“Is nickel in a lot of stuff?”</p>
<p>“So much stuff&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.” Ernestine murmured. She fell silent for a moment as she shifted Helen’s hips to one side, extended her top leg, and started moving it up and down like a lever. “Anyway,” she resumed. “Gerry has me on a treatment program now.”</p>
<p>A moment later, Ernestine stopped in the middle of levering Helen’s leg. She straightened and sighed. “Are we ever going to fix this hip of yours, Helen?”</p>
<p>The truth was, Helen was planning on going back to physio. She’d obtained a doctor’s prescription so that her insurance would cover it and had vowed that this time she would do the exercises they gave her every day, no matter how tedious and agonizing. Right now, however, it seemed important for Helen to reassure Ernestine in the sort of way Ernestine would respond to.</p>
<p>“I just think we have to have faith,” said Helen. “And keep a positive outlook. And be, you know, open.”</p>
<p>“You’re so right,” said Ernestine, resuming. “You’re so wise and even keeled, Helen. I always get this, like, calm vibe from you. Some days you get loaded down with stuff, sure&mdash;we all get loaded down. Oh boy, do I ever. But with you, nothing penetrates too deep.”</p>
<p>When Ernestine left her to get dressed, Helen threw aside the sheet, and her skin cinched tight with goosebumps. She couldn’t believe Ernestine hadn’t fixed the furnace. And now, apparently, the furnace guy was “booked up for months.” There was no way Helen could keep doing this. And there was no way she would spend another winter doing yoga in fingerless gloves and a puffer jacket.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t hadn&#8217;t</span> occurred to Helen to ask what the play was when Nicola invited her. She only knew it was a one-man show starring an old friend of Nicola’s, some elderly theatre stalwart who Helen had never heard of. When they got to the venue, however, she saw it was going to be Beckett. The atmosphere between her and Nicola was already not good, they’d barely spoken during the short walk to the theatre, and now dread settled between Helen’s eyes like a headache. She should have, she realized, anticipated this. Every Beckett play she’d ever sat through had felt to Helen like being crouched inside someone else’s bad dream, and what had her hours on the phone with Nicola been like if not that? A filthy, ancient man sat in his chaotic study, listening to recordings of himself. Every once in a while, he’d lurch centre stage and have a banana, standing completely still with the banana sticking out of his mouth for what felt like an eternity, before he resumed lurching around and ate it. Something about the fact that he did this more than once panicked and infuriated Helen, made her want to shout: <em>Are you kidding me with the fucking banana again?</em> She really did have a headache now. She imagined walking out. She wondered if that might be the best and easiest way to bring this whole Nicola Rasmussen interlude to a close. Would she ever hear from Nicola again? Would assistant Dana with the impeccable email etiquette reach out the following week to confirm their Wednesday time, as she had done without fail every Monday since the spring?</p>
<p>Instead, she absented herself by focusing on the tape recorder as the old man played and rewound the audio. He was using an ancient reel-to-reel machine like the one Helen’s father had brought home in the ’70s. One of the first recordings Helen’s parents made was of her mother saying, “Jesus Christ, how much did that cost, Ray?” It had been high tech and extravagant&mdash;just the kind of gadget her father always liked. The very next recording they made was of Helen, their firstborn. Helen the toddler had discovered singing right around that time, and it was all she wanted to do. When she got a little older, one of her favourite things was to ask her parents to haul out the massive tape recorder and play the tapes of her singing as a toddler. She’d sit listening to her toddler self warbling away, getting the words wrong, making up gibberish to the tune of “Big Rock Candy Mountain.” Older-child Helen would listen to younger-child Helen, feeling wise and affectionate and superior. The funniest thing was that sometimes toddler Helen would exclaim: <em>“I want the</em> girl <em>to sing it now! I want to hear the</em> girl<em>!</em>&thinsp;” Which meant she wanted her mother to rewind the tape so that toddler Helen could listen to herself. Sometimes, she even asked to hear “the girl” sing a song before Helen herself had sung it. Eventually, her mother had to stop everything to explain to Helen that she, Helen, was the singer on the tape. Of course, this made no sense to the toddler, the two-Helen thing, but she just paused and then launched into another song. Older-child Helen had loved that about the toddler, that she’d decided, in that pause, she didn’t care. The tape recorder was uncanny and miraculous&mdash;so what? So was everything in childhood. So what if there were two of her now&mdash;the one who sang in the machine and the one who sat outside and listened? </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-money/">The Money</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p>The soldiers were lined up at attention, ready for dinner. “<em>I have no live rounds, empty casings, or parts thereof in my possession, sir</em>.” They spoke the declaration in unison, as if reciting a line of poetry, almost liturgically. Private Ono spoke the words with a clean heart. He had never stolen a thing in his life. </p>
<p>Truth was, many of the soldiers stole ammo. Some put the liberated bullets under their pillows like teeth, or drilled through the empty casings and hung them from the rearview mirrors of trucks, or even tucked them in their underwear for good luck. Others just liked to have the bullets&mdash;they couldn’t even explain why. One soldier from the regiment, who Ono hoped would not be among those chosen to go to Afghanistan, got off on licking bullets. Licking ammo was fucked up, yes, but the whole enterprise known as the army was fucked up. No need to say anything more than: <em>Dude, that guy is really fucked up</em>. </p>
<p>Ono had observed Corporal MacArthur stealing a handful of bullets earlier that very day. MacArthur saw Ono watching and gave a sly wink. MacArthur was relatively new to the regiment, a bit of a mystery. He put a finger to his lips. Ono quickly looked away. Stolen ammunition was infantry aphrodisiac, and the recent news about the regiment being chosen to go to Afghanistan had put some of the soldiers in a positively sexy mood. Stolen ammo was an acknowledged reality, but the amnesty box was the military version of a get-out-of-jail-free card for soldiers who felt guilty about breaking “the seventh commandment.” Anyone who had stolen ammo could drop it off at the amnesty box, and no one would ask any questions. Of course, very little ammo ended up in the amnesty box, but all kinds of other things did: spent casings stuffed with desiccated condoms, the tail of a mouse, Polaroids of ex-girlfriends. It got so bad one summer that they stationed a guard by the amnesty box. Orders came down from on high that any soldier messing around with the amnesty box would get charged with conduct unbecoming. </p>

<li><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-beekeeper/">The Beekeeper</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If the amnesty box was about grace, then conduct unbecoming was the catch-all for punishing soldiers who screwed up in one of a thousand ways. <em>Any act, conduct, disorder, or neglect to the prejudice of good order and discipline is an offence, and every person convicted thereof is liable to dismissal with disgrace from Her Majesty’s service or to less punishment</em>. Shitting in the shower and leaving it there was one example of conduct unbecoming. This exact scenario occurred during Ono’s basic training: a bewilderingly large human turd in the shower, right before inspection, still warm. Had the criminal ever been discovered, they would have felt the full weight of military law. In the words of their instructors: there is no place in the Queen’s army for someone who shits in the shower AND leaves it there. What function did the conjunction play in the equation, Ono thought. Could you crap in the shower and clean it up? Was that okay? No one ever answered the question because he never did ask it. </p>
<p>“Do you know what they used to say about the British Empire?” MacArthur asked one evening. Training for the day was done, and they were sitting in the Junior Ranks’ Mess, sipping beers and philosophically facing the portrait of the Queen on the wall. </p>
<p>“What did they say about the British Empire?” a private by the name of Shirp said, taking a large mouthful of beer.</p>
<p>“The sun is always setting on the British Empire,” MacArthur said. </p>
<p>“Is that what they really said?” </p>
<p>“Yep.” </p>
<p>“Who said it?” </p>
<p>“The soldiers who were fighting the Queen’s wars.” </p>
<p>“What does it mean?” </p>
<p>“It means we are going to fuck some shit up in Afghanistan.” </p>
<p>“I don’t think that’s why we’re going to Afghanistan,” Ono said, feeling a bit deflated. </p>
<p>“Think what you want,” MacArthur said. “There’s lots of reasons why the great nation of Canada is going to Afghanistan. But we are going ’cause we want to fuck shit up. Don’t even try to lie to me. I’m too smart. We’re natural-born warriors, me and old Shirpey here.” </p>
<p>Shirp smiled. He was missing a front tooth.</p>
<p>“And then there’s people like you,” MacArthur said, pointing at Ono. “Hearts bleeding all over the place. Like you’re always on your period.” </p>
<p>“That’s not true,” Ono said, blushing. “I’m a warrior too.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see about that. When the bullets start flying. You best think about how the Queen Mother would feel if she saw you tuck tail and run.” MacArthur pointed to the tattoo of the Queen on his forearm, then to the portrait of the Queen. “You better not upset her royalness, or there’ll be hell to pay.”</p>
<p>“I won’t,” Ono said, feeling slightly confused.</p>
<p>“You better not,” MacArthur said. “So when are you going to pop your tattoo cherry?” he added. </p>
<p>“What do you mean?” </p>
<p>“I mean, when are you going to get your first tattoo, dipshit.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want a tattoo.” </p>
<p>“Makes sense. Only real men get tattoos,” MacArthur said, raising his arm and kissing the inked Queen. </p>
<p>Ono didn’t know what to think. The importance of the Queen to soldiers of the Canadian military was one of the first realities impressed upon him when he joined the army. The Queen herself was an institution. None of the soldiers remembered a time when Her Majesty the Queen was not alive. Even the crustiest and oldest of corporals had served under Her Majesty when they were fresh-faced privates. None of them had met or even seen the Queen. Most of them hadn’t even left Canada&mdash;or Alberta, for that matter. The Queen was as distant to the soldiers as God, a figure some of them had been told to honour, believe in, or at least acknowledge. And some of them tried. But they couldn’t exactly discern the relevance of this royal Person to their life. And yet, they swore to defend Her and serve in good faith. Every mess hall and Legion in the country carried Her portrait. A few of them had Her tattoo.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he question of</span> warrior status aside, all the soldiers were stoked about going to Afghanistan. The doubters and jokers and anyone who asked too many questions could stuff it down their proverbial pipes. Leadership had already noticed the change in morale since the official announcement. This was the new Canadian military. The decade of darkness was over. The government had money for soldiers again. Before the war, the regiment generally lived with a deficit of training ammunition. Soldiers like Private Ono barely fired live rounds because live rounds were expensive. Ono did not join the military to fire guns. In fact, he didn’t even really enjoy shooting that much. He had joined the army four years after 9/11 because a recruiter came to his high school in Westmount and said the pay was good. Ono also remembered thinking how cool the recruiter looked in uniform. And his parents would approve of the “good pay” part. His parents were indeed fine with his joining the army. They never said so directly, but he heard his mother talking about his service on the phone, and the voice she was using was the proud voice. And, as for his father, the fact that he didn’t speak out against the decision meant that he approved of it. This was the way his family dealt with certain things.</p>
<p>Being in the military itself wasn’t exactly as Ono had anticipated, different both from the movies as well as the low-budget Canadian television recruiting commercials. Reservists remained the lowest of funding priorities. They still trained, but playing war was difficult without real supplies. For the training to work, the soldiers had to be lively enough to possess an active imagination or dumb enough not to care. Life in the reserves taught them that training was generally a game of charades. You had to be an actor. But, with Canadian soldiers dying in Afghanistan, the military budget increased. Bullets started falling from the clouds. Real ammunition meant momentarily forgetting about the times they had to pretend and say, “<em>Bang! Bang!</eM>&thinsp;” The government believed in them. The people who had voted in the government believed in them too&mdash;or so Ono assumed. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">P</span><span class="smallcaps">reparations for Afghanistan</span> were going well. Targets were shot. Somebody had put a traditional Afghan head scarf, a <em>shemagh</em>, on one. Ono looked at the victim: full of holes. “The Taliban don’t stand a fucking chance,” MacArthur said, smirking. He took out his camera and snapped a photo, and Ono flinched. </p>
<p>He had no particular connection to the people of Afghanistan or their culture. His father was Japanese and his mother was Ukrainian. But he didn’t like it when the target was dressed up. A target was not human, and clothes were for humans. And his stomach turned when he realized he might one day be required to shoot a human, not a target. </p>
<p>At the end of the training day, after the range declaration, they loaded into the back of a truck. Five minutes down the road, the truck broke down. Now they were sitting in the back of the truck under a tarp roof, soaked from a sideways rain that got under everything, even the cover. Everyone was bored as shit and hungry. A corporal by the name of Canker started singing “Barrett’s Privateers”: <em>Ohhhh, the year was 1778, how I wish I was in Sherbrooke now</em>. He had a nice voice&mdash;deep, in tune, sincere. It had rained all day. The leaves were off the trees. Summer was undoubtedly over, and the air smelled of rot. They were all miserable and wet, and his voice was beautiful, rich as ale, and it made people stop and listen, either losing their own thoughts or freshly aware of the smell of dying grass and wet leaves and the people next to them. Some, like Ono, felt they had finally arrived at a quintessential military moment, the kind of deep bonding that would bring them together as a platoon and see them through the present wetness into Afghanistan and beyond, like a contemporary “Band of Brothers” who would fight together in a real war. Afghanistan would be free. They would free it. Like Alexander and the Gordian knot: <em>chop</em>. Free of the Taliban, and free of shitty infrastructure and no internet, and free of not having fast-food restaurants like the rest of the world. But no&mdash;in the hushed dark, MacArthur told Canker to shut the fuck up, and he abruptly stopped singing and told him to go eat a big dick, and MacArthur said, “Whatever, dickhead, your last name is Canker,” and Shirp said, “Good luck finding a big dick in this platoon.” And that was the end of the song and they remained miserable in silence. Some soldiers pulled out headphones and retreated into their own private playlists. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smallcaps">ne night,</span> before they left the training area, MacArthur approached the picnic table where Ono was sitting by himself and smoking a cigarillo.</p>
<p>“Come with me,” he said. </p>
<p>“Where are we going?” Ono asked.</p>
<p>“You’ll see.” </p>
<p>They walked until all the tents were behind them and they couldn’t hear any voices. There was frost on the grass. Ono’s feet were wet with it. MacArthur took a large fork out of his pocket and started digging a hole.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Ono said. </p>
<p>MacArthur didn’t reply. Ono was mesmerized, confused. The hole was at least a foot deep when MacArthur stopped digging. He fished around in his pockets and took out a couple of the stolen bullets. In his hand, they looked golden, almost fake, the colour of chocolate-coin wrappers. MacArthur dropped the bullets in the dirt, spat in the hole, then covered it. “I’m leaving little parts of me wherever I go,” he said. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he shooting part</span> of the training was over. They packed up and drove back to Edmonton. Daylight savings had come and gone. Each day was one closer to Afghanistan. The war was waiting for them, brooding in the darkness like a forgotten god. They were leaving in January, and it was now almost Christmas. The sky was various shades of pink and pastel by four in the afternoon. The light was gone before dinner. </p>
<p>The Men’s Christmas Dinner, the final official army event before combined holidays and predeployment leave, was scheduled for mid-December. They had not worn their dress uniforms since Remembrance Day. Some of the uniforms still carried the musk of old alcohol. The troops walked into the dress hall and <em>oooooohed</em> at the scene. Festive tables&mdash;white tablecloths, metal cutlery, glass cups, not plastic&mdash;were set up length-wise. Where bottles of real beer should have been, however, someone had set bottles of ginger beer.</p>
<p>“What the fuck is this?” MacArthur said, picking up a bottle and examining the label.</p>
<p>“What the hell,” Shirp said. Lieutenant Glandy stood up and addressed the regiment.</p>
<p>“This year,” he said, “because of what happened last year, the Men’s Christmas Dinner will, unfortunately, be dry.”</p>
<p>“<em>Boooo</em>,” MacArthur wailed. “<em>Boooooooo</em>.”</p>
<p>“For fuck’s sake,” Shirp said. </p>
<p>“This isn’t right,” MacArthur said, turning to Shirp. “This is immoral. We’re soldiers. The government owes us Christmas beer. What the hell happened last year?”</p>
<p>“Someone got a DUI,” Ono said. “He drove his truck through the fence and onto the soccer field. One of the new privates broke his arm.”</p>
<p>“Broke his arm during the dinner?” MacArthur said.</p>
<p>“On the bleachers, after the dinner, when the wrestling began.” </p>
<p>MacArthur shook his head. “It’s not right. Our last Christmas before Afghanistan and no beer. It’s not right at all.”</p>
<p>Ono said nothing. He didn’t even like beer. But Ono knew that you didn’t advertise things like preferring pop to beer in the infantry, so sometimes he sipped along with everyone else. </p>
<p>A sullen silence descended over what was supposed to be holiday joy. The troops sat down at the table like children whose Christmas gifts had been tossed into the wood stove. Not a single dinner roll was thrown across the tables at anyone. The roast beef was dry, as were the gravy, the water, the ginger beer. The tradition of having the youngest private trade uniform jackets with the commanding officer was a dry disappointment. The private was diminutive and shy, and the battalion commander was bitter and corpulent, and they sat together at the head table in the cramped silence of an unhappy marriage. The uniform switch had always been funny in the past, when everyone was drunk. Sober, nothing was funny.</p>
<p>Regimental leadership had brought in the brass band and some elderly World War II and Korean War vets, who resembled raisins more than soldiers. The tubas started wishing everyone a Merry Christmas. The old veterans were installed at different tables like festive centrepieces. The veterans were supposed to be inspiring. One of them, in a motorized wheelchair, got placed next to MacArthur. Ono watched as MacArthur peered at the substantial rack of medals on his chest. When dinner was being served, MacArthur tipped his bottle of ginger beer over the table. He smiled at the crash. “Whoops,” he said. </p>
<p>The wrinkled veteran looked at him. “You’re a goddamn shit,” he said. </p>
<p>“Yeah, well, you’re old as shit,” MacArthur said. </p>
<p>“Old as shit I may be,” the wrinkled veteran said, brandishing his cane, “but I could teach that smart mouth of yours a goddamn lesson.” </p>
<p>“Easy now, old-timer,” MacArthur said. </p>
<p>A sergeant walked up behind MacArthur and whacked him in the back of the head. Ono tried not to laugh. </p>
<p>“Show a little respect,” the sergeant said, giving MacArthur a serious look. The wrinkled veteran grabbed his bottle of ginger beer and motored to a different table. On the way past MacArthur, he whacked him with his cane. </p>
<p>The dinner stayed dry for less than thirty minutes. Shirp texted his cousin, who immediately went to Superstore and bought a three-litre bottle of vodka, which he brought to the armoury in a black shopping bag. Shirp slipped out of the dinner, met him at the front door, and brought the bottle to the men’s bathroom, where he took three or four quick pulls and placed it under the sink. When most of the young soldiers and some of the older ones had made a trip or three to the bathroom, the Men’s Christmas Dinner was bumping again, and dinner rolls were flying. Ono got caught up in the excitement and threw a dinner roll at a soldier named Abdi, who was sitting three tables down. It missed and struck a fragile-looking vet in the middle of the chest. Ono ran over. “I’m so sorry,” he said. The vet chortled and threw the disintegrating dinner roll right back into Ono’s face. </p>
<p>The servers brought out the Yule log. Soldier to soldier, it was passed down the table. Each person took a tremendous bite. Bits of cake flaked into moustaches and mashed into the tablecloth. The wrinkled old vets didn’t look wrinkled anymore. The bottle in the bathroom was empty. A few soldiers went down to the equipment room and brought back hockey sticks and started playing shinny in their clunky dress boots, slashing the sticks at one another like swords. “RU-FI-O!” MacArthur shouted, brandishing the hockey stick like a shotgun. “Ru-fi-o! Ruuuu-fiiiii-oooo!” </p>
<p>Shirp and a small cluster of hard-core evangelicals started singing bastardized versions of church songs from childhood. They were pounding the table with their fists. Bang, bang, bang. <em>I am gonna march in the infantry</em>, they sang. <em>Ride in the cavalry. Shoot! The artillery. I am gonna shoot all the enemy ’cause I’m in the Lord’s! Army! Yessir. ’Cause I’m in the Lord’s Army, wahoo, yes, I’m in the Lord’s Army, yessir. I am gonna shoot all the Taliban ’cause I’m in the Lord’s Army. WA-HOO!</em>&thinsp; With the final exclamation, buns were tossed high into the air, and a few slices of roast beef were frisbeed from one corner of the table to the other. They struck none of the people they intended and hit a few they didn’t.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps"> few nights later,</span> Ono, MacArthur, and Shirp sat in the barracks, listening to Blink-182 and packing their gear in tidy piles. The year was almost over. The sixth year of the new millennium had passed in a blur of training exercises and alcohol, but what they were doing now made the war seem real. Going to Afghanistan felt irrevocable, like a proclamation from the Bible: “Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up!” As they packed, they sipped from little mugs of whisky. Ono pursed his lips on the rim but did not drink, hoping the others would not notice.</p>
<p>“A clean rifle is like a clean dick,” MacArthur said, stuffing his underwear into a duffel.</p>
<p>“How?” Shirp said. </p>
<p>“It’s ready to use.” </p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure your dick is dirty.” </p>
<p>“Only ’cause I slept with your girlfriend.” </p>
<p>“Let’s remember to buy dry lube before we go to Afghanistan,” Shirp said, changing the subject. “With dry lube, the sand won’t stick. Our rifles will be clean as a goddamn whistle.”  </p>
<p>“What are we actually going to be doing in Afghanistan?” he asked, suddenly serious.</p>
<p>“We’re gonna shoot people, you dipshit,” MacArthur said, standing up and putting his helmet on. “We’re soldiers. You shoot the bad people, then you build the schools.”</p>
<p>“Who are the schools for?” Shirp asked. </p>
<p>“The good people,” MacArthur said. “And the women.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t make any sense at all.” </p>
<p>“You don’t know shit about war. Never did and never will.”</p>
<p>“I know just as much as you.” </p>
<p>“Have you ever even met anyone from Afghanistan?” </p>
<p>“No. Have you?” </p>
<p>“I know all about that shithole of a country,” MacArthur said, ignoring Shirp’s question. “It’s been a big old mess since pretty much forever, even before the Russians sucked balls and ran away. Our job is to sort their shit out.” </p>
<p>Ono frowned and added his gas mask to his pile of gear. He did not like the way that sounded.</p>
<p>After the whisky was gone, MacArthur pulled out a bottle of Smirnoff and passed it around. They all took gulps. Shirp got sad when he was drinking. Even the tiny mouthfuls made Ono sad. Not MacArthur. All this drama had put him in a celebratory mood. He was putting everyone else on notice about his intention of finding a new girlfriend before going to war&mdash;that very weekend. He pressed his thumbs together and stretched out both hands. “The girl’s ass can’t be bigger than that,” he said. Once found, she would be taken to West Edmonton Mall. They would share a nautical-themed room at the Fantasyland Hotel and prance together in the wave pool at the water park. He would buy her lingerie and perfume or whatever she wanted. He would stand above her like a Greek god descended from the clouds and droop grapes into her mouth, and she would, for the whole weekend, suck his brains out through his dick in a state of blissed-out gratitude. This scenario was unlikely, Shirp explained drunkenly. A girl who would agree to spend a weekend with MacArthur would realize sucking his brains out was impossible because he didn’t have any. She might agree to suck a kidney out or maybe a liver. Ono laughed. MacArthur said: “Fuck you, Ono, you prick. If you survive Afghanistan, it’ll be ’cause you look like the local population. Not one other fucking reason.” </p>
<p>The vodka bottle was almost empty. Later that evening, they drove through the city with the windows down. Ono was the least drunk. He was driving. They stopped at a red light on Whyte Avenue. MacArthur was standing in the middle of the vehicle, sticking his head up through the sunroof. “WE ARE GOING TO AF-GHAN-ISTAN!” </p>
<p>A group of women next to a bar cheered and waved. </p>
<p>“Show us your tits!” MacArthur shouted. </p>
<p>“Fuck you,” one of the women said.</p>
<p>“AFGHANISTAAAAAN,” MacArthur shouted. “Shirpey, read that one poem again.”</p>
<p>“Which one?” Shirp asked.</p>
<p>“The one about Afghanistan. The old one. Loud enough so those bitches outside can hear.”</p>
<p>“‘When you’re wounded and left on Afghanistan’s plains!’” Shirp recited his version of the Kipling poem, his voice rising. “‘And the women come out to cut up what remains!’”</p>
<p>“That’s the one,” MacArthur shouted. “That’s it. That’s the fucking one!” </p>
<p>They drove all over the city. MacArthur traded the regimental beret for a helmet. His ears were nipped from the cold. </p>
<p>“Drive past my grandparents’ house,” he said. </p>
<p>“Where is it?” Ono asked. </p>
<p>“In Beverly. I’ll show you.”</p>
<p>The neighbourhood was quiet. Hardly anyone was on the streets. A young mother ushering kids from a van into a house and the glow from windows where people were probably watching the hockey game were all they could see. They pulled up next to a house and stopped. The wind pulled snow up from the ground and into the air. The domed glow of the refinery on the other side of the river pushed up against the grey sky like a tongue against the roof of a mouth. A few pale flakes were falling from the sky.</p>
<p>MacArthur got out of the car and walked right up to the house. No lights were on inside. He stepped off the walkway and peered right into the living room window. </p>
<p>“I can’t see shit,” he said, walking back to the car, still wearing the helmet.</p>
<p>“Ono, grab a flashlight and come with me. Shirpey&mdash;you wait with the car.”</p>
<p>“Is it the right house?” Ono said. </p>
<p>“Of course it is,” MacArthur said. </p>
<p>Ono grabbed the big Maglite from the glovebox and followed MacArthur onto the property. MacArthur opened the gate and walked around to the back of the house. Ono followed. MacArthur went to the back window, peered inside, and knocked. The house was still silent, still no lights. Ono was feeling queasy.</p>
<p>MacArthur moved to the back door: <em>bang, bang, bang</em>. </p>
<p>“They must be sleeping,” he said. </p>
<p>“I think we should go,” Ono said. </p>
<p>“I want to show you the inside. Give me the flashlight.” </p>
<p>Ono passed it to him. MacArthur took off his jacket, wrapped it around the light, then punched in one of the door’s glass panes. He carefully reached inside and unlocked the door, then handed the flashlight back to Ono. “Follow me,” MacArthur said. Ono followed. The house was completely dark. The time on the stove read 11:02. They walked through the kitchen and into the living room. MacArthur paused to look at a frame on the wall. “Shine the flashlight here,” he said. It was a picture of a young woman and a dog. “Hmph,” MacArthur said. He walked into a bedroom. “Shine the flashlight on the bed,” he said. Ono’s head was beginning to swim. He pointed the flashlight at the bed. MacArthur fished around in his pockets. </p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Ono said. </p>
<p>“Looking for these,” MacArthur said. He held his hand under the beam of the flashlight. More of the stolen bullets glowed golden. He placed them under the mattress, then set everything back together carefully. “Let’s go,” he said. They walked outside. The stars were pinpricks of light. The air was cold. Ono took a deep breath. </p>
<p>The vehicle was quiet on the drive back to the base. </p>
<p>“What happened to your grandparents?” Ono said. </p>
<p>“Dipshit,” MacArthur said. “My grandparents never lived in Edmonton. That was my ex’s house.” </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n early January,</span> when the snow-heavy roofs were the colour of the sky&mdash;colder than a witch’s tit, as Lieutenant Glandy put it&mdash;they left for Afghanistan. The send-off was sleepy and uninspiring. The sky had dumped a week’s worth of snow. Many of the people who promised to come were late or didn’t make it. Ono stood in line, feeling nervous. MacArthur and Shirp were ahead of him. After the night of the break-in, Ono had avoided MacArthur. They didn’t even look at each other. It was almost like MacArthur had finished with him, he realized. </p>
<p>The platoon was mostly young soldiers. The largest percentage of attendees were parents and girlfriends. Ono’s parents stood in front of him, arm in arm. Among friends and family, they spoke loudly and laughed and teased, but under the fluorescent lighting of the drill hall, they looked wan and withdrawn. Their silence embarrassed him. They hugged him but did not speak. His father smelled of car oil and peppermint gum. His mother smelled of cigarettes and sweat. As they released him, he turned and swore he would not look back. A moment later, when he looked back, they were staring at the ground. </p>
<p>The time to depart finally came. “Troops,” Lieutenant Glandy said, “let’s get a move-on. Form up.” Most of the soldiers had been standing around and feeling awkward and were grateful for direction. A colonel with a pert moustache whom none of them knew said some hardly discernible words, and the farewell was over. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he wheels of the plane</span> touched down. The passengers jerked forward in their seats, then slowed to a halt. The light was bright when they stepped outside. They clutched their rifles apprehensively. Under their feet, the asphalt of the runway felt surprisingly normal. The mountains surrounding the airfield didn’t even look that special: dusty and brown and boring. Ono looked down at his hands and suddenly wanted to go home. “That’s it?” MacArthur said. “It feels exactly like Canada. It’s not even that hot.”</p>
<p>The base was larger than they had anticipated. Kandahar Airfield, KAF, or TLC, Taliban’s Last Stand. It went by all these names. The base served over 10,000 coalition soldiers and contractors. Western-style cafeterias were scattered throughout. There was a shopping area called the boardwalk, with coffee shops and a Burger King and a Tim Hortons. There was a huge gym and an outdoor shinny arena. The soldiers nodded in approval.</p>
<p>That afternoon, they were all assigned tents from among those lined up next to one another in a giant field of gravel, on large, rectangular concrete pads. Fifteen or so soldiers, each with a partitioned, semiprivate cubicle of his own, per tent. Ono was assigned the cubicle next to MacArthur. The proximity to MacArthur gave him a stomach ache. He thought about asking someone to switch with him but didn’t. He put his headphones on and tried to pretend that the cubicle next to him was empty. </p>
<p>That night, after their first meal of chicken wings and fries in the cafeteria, after everyone had withdrawn to their cubicles, Ono heard MacArthur lift the flap and pad outside. Ono lifted the flap on his window. Through the cross-hatch weaving of the mosquito netting, he could see MacArthur digging a hole under a tree with almond-shaped leaves. Ono saw him kneel down and drop something in, and he knew what was going in the hole.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he next evening,</span> after a boring day spent waiting for the rest of the soldiers from the platoon to arrive, some of the more energetic soldiers gathered in the long midsection of the tent and started practising quick draws with their pistols. “<em>Bang! Bang!</em>&thinsp;” they shouted. They were still a little loopy from the time change. Ono was unpacking his gear.</p>
<p>MacArthur and Shirp stood on either side of the long tent. “<em>Bang! Bang!</em>&thinsp;” They dropped the magazines from the pistols, and the magazines clattered onto the concrete floor. The two were both in their underwear, pistol holsters slung over their boxers. “Draw your weapon,” MacArthur commanded. He was speaking in the voice of a cowboy: “I said draw!” Shirp pulled his pistol, MacArthur pulled his. Shirp’s pistol: <em>click</em>. MacArthur’s pistol: BANG. </p>
<p>The tent was silent. </p>
<p>The sharpness of cordite. </p>
<p>Ono had heard the gunshot through his headphones. He ran out of his cubicle and saw Shirp lying on the floor, holding his stomach. Shirp’s hands were red.</p>
<p>“Get a medic,” Ono screamed. </p>
<p>MacArthur had not yet opened his mouth. He hadn’t exactly closed it either. He was staring at the pistol in his hand. “I thought,” he said. “I thought&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;”</p>
<p>The front door swung open. “What the fuck is going on?” Lieutenant Glandy yelled. He saw Shirp lying on the floor, convulsing. Ono was pressing his hands against Shirp’s stomach. Blood was seeping through. </p>
<p>“Get some towels,” Lieutenant Glandy said. “Someone, get some towels. We need to get him to the hospital.”</p>
<p>MacArthur was still standing, staring at his pistol. “I thought the bullets were out,” he said. “The magazine is on the floor. It’s right here. Where did the bullet come from? I thought the bullets were out. Oh shit, oh fuck.”</p>
<p>Lieutenant Glandy looked over at MacArthur. “You’re done,” he said. “You’re gone. Next flight. You’re going the fuck home. The war’s over, you fucking idiot.” </p>
<p>Ono could feel the pulse through Shirp’s stomach. He looked at his face: Shirp’s eyes were half open, his cheeks pale and clammy. Someone was shouting. Honking from one of the vehicles. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smallcaps">onths later,</span> when the summer was hot and more soldiers were dying, Ono sat on his bunk, covering his eyes with his hands. The soldier in the cubicle next to him was plinking on his guitar. All Ono wanted was silence. An empty field with tall, wet grass. No one was in the field, not one single human. Not the sergeants or Lieutenant Glandy or even the Queen. He was also not there. No one was. </p>
<p>Ono had once liked the guitar-playing soldier who replaced MacArthur. Now he couldn’t find it in himself to like anyone. And lately, he found himself wondering what the Queen was doing. Asleep, clean, likely in one of her castles, he thought, not bleeding. A rumour was going around that Prince Harry was serving in Afghanistan. Was the Queen worrying about her grandson? Did she worry at all? Probably, he thought. They just didn’t have to worry about who would pay the rent. Was the Queen worried about Canadian soldiers like him? Probably not. There was only so much worry a single person could carry around or spread across the ocean. In two months, if he was still alive, he would return to Canada, and the Queen would neither know nor care, nor would anyone else. What was he returning to? Waving flags and Red Fridays and whatever money he had earned in Afghanistan? His parents? </p>
<p>The letters from his parents had been irregular at first, but now they were coming every week, sometimes more often. One of the sergeants dropped the mail right on his bed. He didn’t even open the letters anymore. He threw them under the cot and let them be. </p>
<p>He sprang from his bed and ran outside. The light was fading, slender ribbons falling from the heavens and resting at the feet of the mountains. He found the tree with the almond-shaped leaves and knelt in the gravel beneath it where MacArthur had knelt. With his hands, Ono started digging. A British soldier stared as he motored past in a golf cart. Ono didn’t care. If he could find the bullets and remove them from the soil, maybe things would turn around. Maybe a spell would be broken. He kept digging, yelping when a fingernail caught a rock. He could not find the bullets. Maybe it was the wrong spot. Maybe the bullets had never been there. Maybe he had imagined the whole thing, seeing MacArthur working in the moonlight. A few tears slid from the end of his nose into the empty, meaningless holes. His tears were as meaningless as the holes. </p>
<p>Not far away, helicopters were winging across the hot asphalt of the runway, landing and taking off. A C-130 was flying high in the sky, waiting to land. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/going-to-afghanistan/">Going to Afghanistan</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>
