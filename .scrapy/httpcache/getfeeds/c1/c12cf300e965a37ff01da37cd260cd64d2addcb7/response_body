		<description><![CDATA[For half a century, we have thrown everything we have at the disease, but we are no closer to curing it]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="1320" src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Pellerin_Cancer_JeanniePhan_1800.jpeg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="An illustration of syringes launching and crashing into a giant cancer cell like rockets." style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="" /><p><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="smallcaps">hristopher Booth</span> walks into the examination room with a warm smile, pulls up a chair close to his patient, and leans in. He doesn’t check notes on a clipboard, doesn’t glance at a computer screen. He studies his charts thoroughly before entering so that patients have his full attention. Booth, a medical oncologist and professor at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, specializes in gastrointestinal cancer. Most of the people he treats have advanced disease. In this Friday-morning clinic, he will see nine patients, most with complex cases.</p>
<p>A woman in her twenties who’d had colorectal <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/cancer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cancer</a> is frightened about a node on her lung. Booth assures her it’s just something to watch. An elderly man’s colon cancer has come back. It’s potentially curable, but the new tumour is in such a difficult place that removing it will require massive, risky surgery. It will be best to shrink the tumour first with chemotherapy. Another gentleman with relapsed metastatic colon cancer is here with his wife. They understand his disease is not curable, but they’re concerned the headaches he’s experiencing might mean it is escalating. They want to travel. A seventy-one-year-old woman, otherwise healthy, has pancreatic cancer. Booth must give her the disappointing news that she isn’t eligible for a clinical trial where she could have chemotherapy ahead of surgery. Her liver tests indicate it would be dangerous. Without diminishing the gravity of her situation, he offers reasons to be positive and promises that she will get the drug after the surgery. </p>
<!-- Widget Shortcode --><div id="custom_html-47" class="widget_text widget widget_custom_html widget-shortcode area-arbitrary "><div class="textwidget custom-html-widget"><div class='_form_1'></div><script type='text/javascript' src='https://thewalrus.activehosted.com/f/embed.php?static=0&id=1&6557B00E61312&nostyles=1&preview=0'></script></div></div><!-- /Widget Shortcode -->
<p>These are tough conversations. Booth believes it’s important to be honest, pragmatic, and upfront with patients, but he is also kind, listens, takes his time. He asks how they are emotionally, extends a comforting touch. For the woman with pancreatic cancer, his office will arrange a social worker. To the young woman anxious about the node on her lung, he suggests an app for mindful meditation, one he’s tried himself. </p>
<p>Booth loves being a cancer doctor. He knew from the moment he began his oncology rotation in residence twenty years ago it was what he’d choose to do. He was drawn to the “powerful human relationships” between oncologist and patient. Beyond the mechanics of knowing which drug to use or which test to order and how to interpret the results, oncology is about balancing hope and reality, he explains. It’s about providing patients with information to make decisions about their own care. </p>
<p>Booth’s second passion is research. He sees patients two days a week. The other three, he leads a team that delves into “really big picture issues”: how the health care system works, how care is delivered, and to what extent patients benefit from treatments. He is the Canada research chair in population cancer care and director of cancer care and epidemiology at Queen’s Cancer Research Institute. He is deeply concerned about a cancer system he says is in serious trouble. He sees resources squandered on “obscenely” costly new cancer drugs that do not improve survival, while resources for basic services like palliative care are lacking. He is calling for a common-sense revolution in oncology. </p>
<p>He’s pushing back against a cancer theology that goes back five decades to December 23, 1971, the day that United States president Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act and launched the “war on cancer,” pledging hundreds of millions of dollars for research. If it was possible to send a man to the moon, lobbyists had argued, why not put the same kind of money and skill toward trying to conquer cancer in five years, in time for the nation’s 200th birthday, in 1976? Nixon’s National Cancer Act reverberated globally. The National Cancer Institute is now the world’s largest cancer research funder, sponsoring cutting-edge research that goes beyond American borders. Canadian scientists have enjoyed a long-standing collaboration with their US counterparts and are the only non-American partner in the NCI’s clinical trials network. Canada joined the war and embraced the rhetoric of cure.</p>
<p>Today, the sums of money devoted to cancer research are staggering. The value of the NCI’s annual research grants, which totalled $67.3 million (US) in 1972, approached $3 billion in 2020. Members of the International Cancer Research Partnership&mdash;an alliance of more than 140 cancer research organizations in the US, Canada, Europe, Japan, and Australia&mdash;accounted for $8.5 billion (US) for research in 2018. In Canada, funding from government and charities amounted to $7.4 billion over the fifteen years from 2005 to 2019, an average of roughly $500 million a year. None of this includes investments by industry. </p>
<p>And what has the chase for the cure accomplished? In Canada, cancer diagnosis rates have declined slightly each year over the past decade, by 1.2 percent for women and 1.5 percent for men. Cancer mortality rates are also down. In 1984, the mortality rate for men was 335 per 100,000. By 2021, it decreased to 217. Similarly, the mortality rate for women decreased from 204 per 100,000 to 163. The improvements are attributed to early detection, better treatments, and fewer people smoking. </p>
<p>So yes, we’ve made progress. Yet cancer remains the leading cause of death. About one in two Canadians will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetimes; one in four will die of it. The toll is more than 80,000 per year. The proportion of the population dying from cancer has actually grown in comparison to other causes of death in recent years. In 2019, cancer accounted for 28.2 percent of all deaths, while heart disease accounted for just 18.5 percent. And even though the rates of diagnosis and mortality have declined, the number of cases will increase as the population grows and ages. </p>
<p>And this is where Booth would like to begin a conversation. As a society facing an increasing burden of cancer, costing an estimated $26 billion in 2021, how do we allocate resources? Should we continue spending $150,000, or more, a year to treat a patient with a drug that provides marginal benefits? Booth acknowledges that, in the past decade, we’ve had some transformative medications. However, he says, these are exceptions floating in a sea of mediocre drugs that extend life for three months on average, often just weeks. There would be greater public health benefit if we instead put more into end-of-life care. He says it’s easy to give a drug but almost impossible to find resources to let patients stay in their homes with good nursing, companionship, and good food. “We completely fail patients near the end of life where we provide one thing but not the other,” he says. “How can we be okay with that?”</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he premise</span> behind the war on cancer was wrong. Cancer is not a single grim foe. We know now there are hundreds of distinct cancers. An oncologist in the 1980s would have known there were two types of lung cancer. Today, by looking at the molecular biology of the tumour cells, scientists can determine there are at least eighty different subtypes of lung cancer. There are at least twenty subtypes of breast cancer. In Booth’s speciality, there was just colon cancer until the past decade. Now there are a dozen known subtypes.</p>
<p>Cancer is the result of errors and mutations in our genetic code. Human cells are constantly replenished through the process of cell division, and normally, each new cell contains a copy of our entire genome. But mistakes occur. A gene might not get copied. There might be multiple copies of the same gene. Bits of chromosomes can fuse together. The errors can be random, or they can result from DNA damage caused by exposures to harmful substances, such as ultraviolet rays from the sun. The result is rogue cells&mdash;cancer cells&mdash;that divide and grow in ways they shouldn’t, forming tumours and invading different parts of the body. And this is what makes cancer so hard to solve: my cancer may look like yours&mdash;it might develop in the same place, say, the colon&mdash;but each person’s cancer has a unique set of genetic changes. The variation and complexity in tumour biology make treatment a challenge. </p>
<p>Not to say that we can’t cure some cancers in some people or at least help people live longer. Today, thanks to treatments like tamoxifen, only a small minority diagnosed with breast cancer will die of it. Due to early detection and better treatments, most will not die of their colon cancer. Many cancers caught early can be cured with surgery and radiation, often without additional drug treatment. However, for most types of cancers, once they have become metastatic&mdash;they’ve spread from their original site to other parts of the body&mdash;there is no cure. Even so, people are surviving some metastatic cancers longer. Twenty-five years ago, survival for men with metastatic prostate cancer was two years on average; now, with more effective treatments, it’s about five. </p>
<p>Other cancers continue to stymie our efforts: esophageal, ovarian, and some lung cancers, for example, or glioblastoma, a brain cancer. Cancers in which symptoms don’t show up until the disease has already advanced, and for which there are no screening procedures, are the hardest to treat. Pancreatic cancer is especially difficult. By the time it’s discovered, it has usually spread to the liver or blood vessels and cannot be removed by surgery except in 10 to 20 percent of cases. The average prognosis at the metastatic stage is about a year. Although pancreatic cancer accounts for about 3 percent of cancers diagnosed annually in Canada, it is the third leading cause of cancer deaths. </p>
<p>For decades, the best treatment available, after surgery and radiation, was chemotherapy. It’s a blunt tool that ravages the good cells along with the bad and can cause as much suffering as the disease. But today’s powerful microscopes increasingly reveal the intricacies of a human cell: how DNA, RNA, and proteins interact and alter in ways that permit cancer cells to grow&mdash;and how, with technology, those processes might be stopped.</p>
<p>One evolving option is immunotherapy. Normally, our immune system detects and kills abnormal cells. But cancer cells can trick our immune cells by sending a signal that says, “Do not attack.” In the 1990s, scientists discovered it’s possible to shut off that signal. That led to the development of drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors, which block the signal’s pathway. The first such drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2011, for treating advanced melanoma. By 2017, the FDA had approved this type of immunotherapy for about a dozen different metastatic cancers, including advanced kidney cancer, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma. For metastatic melanoma, immunotherapy has proved exceptional, giving years of life to many. In other cancers, however, a small minority of people do very well on the drugs, but most do not. Either they do not respond at all or suffer intolerable side effects. Researchers have yet to find biomarkers to predict who will, or won’t, do well.</p>
<p>A newer immunotherapy innovation is chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, or CAR-T, which involves modifying a patient’s immune system cells. The cells are taken from a patient’s blood and then re-engineered in a lab to form attack cells that are infused, in large numbers, back into the patient. A highly personalized treatment for certain blood cancers such as leukemia or lymphoma, CAR-T is often a last-ditch chance for people who have not seen results from other treatments, or when other treatments no longer work. The FDA approved the first such therapy in 2017. Health Canada approved it in 2018. There is enthusiasm for this new technology, because where there was once no hope, some patients are surviving three to five years. As yet, CAR-T is not a treatment for solid tumour cancers, meaning cancers in organs or tissues. </p>
<p>One drawback of CAR-T is that it works only in about 30 to 40 percent of cases. Also, it’s extremely expensive. The list price of a single CAR-T treatment is $500,000 (US). A Canadian initiative is attempting to address the cost issue. Scientists from the Ottawa Hospital, BC Cancer, and Vancouver General Hospital have developed a publicly funded non-commercial product costing about $100,000. Ottawa haematologist Natasha Kekre is currently leading a clinical trial testing the product on a small group of lymphoma patients. In early results, half of the patients responded to the treatment. A big part of her goal, Kekre says, “is not just treating patients and curing them but also to do this in a way that is feasible and sustainable.” </p>
<p>Another major innovation is targeted therapy, or drugs that avoid damaging normal cells by zeroing in on cancer cells directly. They block the signals that cause cancer cells to grow, or they change the proteins within cancer cells to make them die. The first such drug was Herceptin, approved by the FDA in 1998. Herceptin targets a specific protein implicated in one type of breast cancer. Gleevec, approved by the FDA in 2001, was revolutionary in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. CML patients have a chromosomal aberration where pieces from two chromosomes swap places. Researchers discovered the culprit genes responsible for this fusion produced a mutant protein. Gleevec worked to inhibit that protein. Before Gleevec, CML was a fatal disease. Today, most CML patients can expect an almost normal lifespan. Building on Gleevec’s success, the majority of new oncology medicines developed in the past two decades are targeted therapies for a long list of cancers.  </p>
<p>Going one step further, we have precision oncology. Precision medicine, sometimes called personalized medicine, uses someone’s genetic information to find a drug that might work for them. With cancer, the genetic information is taken from a tumour. Janessa Laskin is a medical oncologist and associate professor of medicine at the University of British Columbia. In 2012, she co-founded, and now co-leads, the BC Personalized Onco-Genomics  Program, known as POG. The program sequences DNA and RNA in cancer cells to determine whether a person’s cancer is “actionable,” meaning there is a genetic aberration that can be targeted. A team of researchers then scours the literature, looking for drugs that could block what’s causing the aberration. It’s not always about fancy new drugs; they also try old drugs or drugs approved for another disease or another type of cancer they could use off label. </p>
<p>Laskin’s view is that there might be thousands of distinct cancers. “I do think that every cancer is unique,” she says. That doesn’t mean we need a different treatment for each individual person. “But the more we know about cancers and the different things that can drive dysregulated  growth, the more we see how different things are.” So far, POG has sequenced the tumours of about a thousand people with incurable disease. Not surprisingly, extension of life for most has been a matter of months, with rare, remarkable exceptions. Laskin explains that the value of the program lies in the data that will give us a better picture of how different cancers behave and clues to better treatments.</p>
<p>Ian Tannock is not so sure precision oncology can be effective. He is a medical oncologist and biophysicist, retired from a celebrated thirty-six-year career at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto. He reflects that, after the triumph of Gleevec and advances in gene sequencing, oncologists might have believed tumours could be genetically sequenced in order to attack specific mutations on an individualized basis. “Disappointingly, that hasn’t happened,” he says. Researchers in France were the first to test precision oncology in a randomized clinical trial. They compared a group of patients whose tumours were sequenced and who were treated with off-label drugs to a group under traditional care. In 2015, they reported that precision medicine made no difference.  More trials are currently underway in France and the US. In 2021, Tannock looked at 22,000 patients in several such trials and found that the percentage of people who could be matched to a drug based on a genetic profiling of their tumours was low, and that, for many, the drugs didn’t work. At best, precision medicine remains a work in progress. </p>
<p>Tannock says a major problem is that cancers change as they grow. A 2012 study in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em> showed that you can have biopsy tumours from different places in the body, or even from different parts of the tumour, and find varying genetic mutations. “You can think of a tumour as a tree having different-coloured leaves, and targeting one or two of these will prune the tree but it won’t make the tree stop growing.” He believes people are being hoodwinked into thinking that genetic testing of cancer cells is going to be the answer. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smallcaps">hether it&#8217;s</span> immunotherapy, precision oncology, the latest buzz around a cancer vaccine, or blood tests to screen for cancer, new technology spurs renewed fervour for a cure. Booth recognizes there have been significant advances, but he cringes at the hype from the pharmaceutical industry and from media reports that make new drugs or innovations look like breakthroughs. They feed false hope to patients. He sees it in his practice. Many who are told their cancers likely won’t come back, and that additional treatment is probably unnecessary, regardless feel they should give themselves the opportunity to do everything possible. They insist on the treatment. Or when he’s made it clear the disease is incurable, patients in their last few months of life think that to not fight it would be giving in. They may have family and friends who urge them to keep trying, sometimes influenced by something they’ve read or seen on TV. </p>
<p>Rachel Koven’s husband, Ken, was in Booth’s care before he died of metastatic gastroesophageal cancer seven years ago, at the age of forty-eight. After an initial round of chemotherapy, he did well for nine months, then the disease spread to his brain. What followed was a very difficult period when he had full brain radiation, which did not help much, and then insisted on additional treatment, which resulted in an acute infection. Yet he wanted that treatment again. He refused to contemplate palliative care. Koven did her best to respect and support her husband’s wishes but regrets that he missed out on any quality of life at the end of their time together. “It would have been much more peaceful and less traumatic if he would have accepted the place he was in,” she says. “And we would have managed things more gently in the end.”</p>
<p>In a way, the language of war puts pressure on patients to keep fighting, partly based on a misplaced faith in drugs. Many of the drugs developed in the past twenty years provide marginal benefit to people with incurable disease. Drug regulators like the FDA, Health Canada, and the European Medicines Agency permit shortcuts in the interest of getting drugs to market faster. Drugs can be approved on the basis of what’s called progression-free survival. Did the drug shrink the tumour? And how long was it before it grew again? The assumption is that the interval before the tumour progresses once more can predict how long the patient will actually live. “We measure how long it takes a tumour to grow on a CAT scan, and we assume that translates to people living longer,” Booth explains. It doesn’t. </p>
<p>When manufacturers are allowed shortcuts, it is usually on the condition that they do further trials to confirm a clinical benefit. A review of drugs approved by the FDA between 1992 and 2017 found that only in 20 percent of those further confirmatory trials was there evidence that people lived longer. Health Canada approves most but not all of the drugs the FDA approves. Then, before they get to market, there is an additional layer of scrutiny from the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review, created by the provincial and territorial ministries of health to make recommendations on which drugs are both clinically and cost effective. Looking at drugs for solid tumour cancers recommended from 2011 to 2020, Booth’s team found that for only half of seventy-eight such drugs was there evidence that patients lived longer&mdash;for an average of just 3.7 months. And this data comes from clinical trials, where patients often do better than those in the real world. </p>
<p>Consider, too, how costly cancer drugs can be. In 2019, Canada spent $3.9 billion on oncology medication. That’s three times the total in 2010. Expensive new drugs for metastatic cancer are driving the ballooning expenditure. In the US, the average annual cost for a new cancer treatment is $196,000 (US). That would be just under $270,000 in Canadian dollars, although drugs are cheaper in Canada due to our drug price review mechanisms and negotiations with manufacturers on behalf of provinces. </p>
<p>If we are striving to help people live longer, the cost could well be justified. But what trade-offs are we willing to accept for drugs that extend life by a matter of weeks? Especially if the quality of life in those remaining weeks is poor due to the harmful side effects from treatment and due to what Booth calls “time toxicity.” When patients are at the end of life, he’d like them to consider how much of their remaining time they will spend getting to and from appointments and sitting in waiting rooms, forgoing time on the boat with the grandkids because they are ill from the treatment or not travelling to a family wedding because it would mean missing a chemo session.</p>
<p>Booth’s research has shown that, for patients in the last year of life, whatever extension is gained may be completely offset by the time used up getting treatment. He encourages oncologists to be open with their patients about minimal benefits so they can better decide how to live their last days. One recent US study reported a high percentage of terminally ill patients did not understand their treatments would not cure them.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n 2016,</span> Bishal Gyawali was a young oncologist from Nepal studying in Japan when he read a news story about a US cancer centre suing a billionaire philanthropist over the right to use the term “cancer moonshot.” How ridiculous, he thought. Who cares who owns it? The term had become a household phrase when then vice president Joe Biden used it to describe a program he had launched earlier that year to support cutting-edge technology that would “end cancer as we know it.” But Gyawali couldn’t imagine the results of moonshot efforts in precision medicine or immunotherapy being available to patients like his in Nepal who couldn’t even afford the old drugs. “Forget the moon,” he wrote in a blog post. “I’d rather support a ‘cancer groundshot’ that focuses on smoking and obesity reduction campaigns, promotes exercise and healthy diet, and encourages research that can be immediately applied to every global community.” </p>
<p>The term caught on. In 2017, Gyawali was invited to speak at an international conference. Booth was excited to hear about it and picked up the phone. He urged Gyawali to write a paper about a “cancer groundshot.” The paper was eventually published in <em>The Lancet Oncology</em>. In 2019, Gyawali passed up a position at Harvard to join Booth at Queen’s, where he is now associate professor of oncology and public health. </p>
<p>Booth and Gyawali hope to convince oncology colleagues, and the public, that the best cancer care isn’t about the latest super-tech innovation. The moonshot approach may lead to better outcomes for some people sometime in the future. Their groundshot approach would be a parallel effort that would improve the quality of life for people coping with illness right now. It would concentrate on treatments that we know work and make access to care more equitable. There are gaps in northern and Indigenous communities, and among poorer and immigrant communities, where people are less likely to be referred to oncology specialists. Booth argues that many across the world currently do not have access to bread-and-butter chemotherapy or basic hormone therapy for breast cancer. “We could save many more lives right now if we just implement the knowledge we already have.” </p>
<p>A cancer groundshot would include an emphasis on prevention. Anti-smoking campaigns have resulted in fewer deaths from lung cancer. The HPV vaccine has the potential to eliminate cervical cancer. Screening has reduced deaths from colon cancer. In 2014, a huge research project conducted by Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Research at Cancer Care Alberta, in partnership with the Canadian Cancer Society, brought together scientists from across the country to quantify the risks for cancer that we can control. The study, called ComPARe (Canadian Population Attributable Risk of Cancer), resulted in a series of reports published in 2019. The main conclusion: four out of ten cancers are preventable.</p>
<p>According to ComPARe’s analysis of 2015 data, smoking was linked to 17.5 percent of all cases in that year, mostly lung cancers, but also to cancers related to the liver, esophagus, pancreas, bladder, and kidneys. Physical inactivity was linked to almost 4.9 percent of all cancers. Ultraviolet radiation from the sun and tanning beds: 2.3 percent. Other risk factors include alcohol, sedentary behaviour, low fruit and vegetable consumption, red and processed meat. Emerging in the research is the increasing role that excess body weight will play in the future. Unless trends reverse, cancer deaths related to obesity will double to 5,600 deaths per year within the next twenty-five years. In all, the study identified more than twenty modifiable risk factors&mdash;behaviours or circumstances we can change&mdash;linked to thirty cancer types. The ComPARe findings suggest we can prevent 85 percent of lung cancers, 43 percent of colorectal cancers and 21.4 percent of female breast cancers. </p>
<p>Stunning as the Canadian research may seem, it is consistent with similar work in the US, the UK, and Australia. We could reduce the cancer burden on future generations with greater efforts in prevention. Yet prevention accounts for only 2 to 5 percent of cancer research funding in Canada. In the fifty years of the “war on cancer,” our obsession has been fixing the problem, not stopping it from occurring. </p>
<p>In the 1970s context, the focus on cure is understandable. Today we know how random and complex cancer can be and how difficult it is to achieve progress. Yet simplistic promises persist. Princess Margaret Cancer Foundation’s fundraising slogan claims “together we can conquer cancer in our lifetime.” Tannock hates that slogan intensely. “I think that is lying to patients, and I think it is abhorrent.” </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/are-we-losing-the-war-on-cancer/">Are We Losing the War on Cancer?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

His wife, Mary, tended to him with worried love. He was only forty-four years old. </p>
<p>Mary told us how she helped him with medications, food, and appointments. She admired and supported his resilience and good nature. But she also grew increasingly irked by Louis’s fascination with Joe Dispenza, a former chiropractor who allows himself to be called a neuroscientist by the many alt-med platforms that host him and who promises followers they can cure their diseases through breath work and meditation. </p>
<p>Mary had always loved Louis’s credulity, his willingness to think the best of people. She trusted that he was getting some kind of relief she couldn’t quite name from this influencer she described as having a God complex. But it didn’t sit right.	</p>
<!-- Widget Shortcode --><div id="custom_html-47" class="widget_text widget widget_custom_html widget-shortcode area-arbitrary "><div class="textwidget custom-html-widget"><div class='_form_1'></div><script type='text/javascript' src='https://thewalrus.activehosted.com/f/embed.php?static=0&id=1&6557B00E629DF&nostyles=1&preview=0'></script></div></div><!-- /Widget Shortcode -->
<p>Louis had introduced Dispenza to Mary before his cancer diagnosis upended their lives. They used his recorded meditations to help them fall asleep. As Dispenza droned on in what Mary described as a megachurch style, she got creeped out and asked Louis to shut him off. Now that he was ill, she worried that this newfound obsession could hurt Louis while he navigated the perils to come. By her lights, Dispenza was camped out in Louis’s mind at a vulnerable time, offering garbage in the form of hope.	</p>
<p>Mary (we’re withholding surnames for privacy) told us she had always had a science brain, but she wasn’t completely closed off to spirituality. She’d taken a yoga teacher training course. As a certified applied psychologist, she was clear on the researched value of positive thinking. Louis, on the other hand, had always placed New Age spirituality and far-out health ideas at the centre of his life. She used to joke that he had a real master’s degree&mdash;an MBA from Duke that made her a proud girlfriend and wife&mdash;and then his fake master’s in spiritual psychology from a New Age degree mill called the University of Santa Monica, which gave her a permanent case of side-eye.	</p>

 </a></li>
</ul>
<p>At USM, Louis learned a little about Freud and Jung and a lot about Akashic Records: tarot, yoga, meditation, and how to recall past lives. He also completed a certification program in conscious, radiant health and healing, which he believed had helped him heal an injured knee without surgery. On their first date, Mary snooped through his bookshelf and spotted <em>Psychology for Dummies</em>. “Was that your course textbook?” she asked. The ribbing didn’t kill the date. Within months, like a positive and negative charge of mystic rationalism, they married. But they had only a few months together before Louis started quickly losing weight.		</p>
<p>Pancreatic cancer has a tragically low survival rate. Initially, Louis fared well with his conventional treatment. The labs were encouraging, and the specialists urged him to stay the course. But the advice he was really hooked on came from people like Dispenza and the meditations he taught, based in part on his 2014 book, <em>You Are the Placebo</em>, in which he describes healing his six vertebrae that were shattered in a bicycle crash by refusing surgery and spending hours a day using a higher intelligence to visualize his spine knitting itself back together. According to Dispenza, accessing this quantum field of matter allowed him to dispense with medical advice and think his bones back into wholeness. He dubs the process “becoming your own placebo.” It’s a nonsense phrase that translates to “You can become an inert substance that has no medical effect but could fool you temporarily into feeling relief from symptoms.” </p>
<p>Everything that Mary knew about Dispenza came through the eyes of Louis, who felt he needed him. That aspirational view chafed against Mary’s knowledge that if he was going to make any miraculous recovery, it would be by focusing on the very worldly plan laid out by his oncologist. Louis disagreed. “I was able to heal my knee,” Mary remembers Louis saying about the meditations, “so I should be able to heal this.”							</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">J</span><span class="smallcaps">oe Dispenza’s</span> affable vibe and hopeful content has helped him play a major role in the normalization and domestication of a spiritual pseudoscience that looms large on mainstream platforms like Facebook. He is a middle-class Italian American Gen X boy who, according to his own account, got along with his mom and dad. He wears nice tailored shirts. He succeeds with an efficiency unknown to boomer cult leaders, who always had the pressures of brick and mortar overhead. All Dispenza needs is an inflow of attention that drives up subscriptions. He is now just another part of a social media experience.</p>
<p>In December 2020, Dispenza visited Aubrey Marcus’s podcast studio and summed up why he thinks his magic works. “Science has become the contemporary language of mysticism,” he said. “And if you can combine a little quantum physics with a little neuroscience with neuroendocrinology with psychoneuroimmunology, the mind body connection, epigenetics&mdash;all of those sciences point the finger at possibility.” They might. Unfortunately, Dispenza has no clinical training or experience in any of these subjects to be able to say for sure. He graduated from Life University in Marietta, Georgia, in the mid-1980s with a degree in chiropractic. In 2002, Life University lost its accreditation with the governing chiropractic regulators. A report from the time said, “Life students were not being taught how to detect and deal with problems that require medical attention.” Students were taught that all underlying causes of illness come from subluxations, a term used by “straight” chiropractors (those who focus solely on skeletal adjustments) to denote a partial or full dislocation of a joint or organ&mdash;and which, they say, cannot necessarily be observed by X-rays. It’s a bunk theory.					</p>
<p>“If you talk about religion,” Dispenza continued, “if you talk about culture, if you talk about tradition, even spirituality, I notice that you divide the audience. But science in that sense creates community.” 					</p>
<p>It’s a sneaky argument, given the popular impression that <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/category/science/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">science</a> culture is cold and inhumane. It’s a way for Dispenza’s scientific notions to be validated by the good vibes of a charismatic event. Science that feels that good must be science done correctly, right? Dispenza&#8217;s mishandling of scientific language conceals the fact that his in-person events play out like tent-revival faith healing, where he practises laying on hands and promises women his meditations can cure their infertility and participants weep and praise God. The mirage of science and respectability also made it difficult for someone like Mary to completely dismiss him when Louis was in his hour of need. So when he wanted to go to one of Dispenza’s intensive healing events, during the peak of a <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> wave&mdash;in Florida, no less, which at the time had some of the most lax protections in place for the immunocompromised&mdash;Mary gave him her blessing and hoped that participants would be masked and that he would keep track of his medications.			</p>
<p>Louis went for a week. Mary managed waves of anxiety as she imagined the participants unmasked and hugging each other in faith-healing ecstasies. While we don’t know what exactly Louis’s week looked like, her fears were reasonable.	</p>
<p>Aubrey Marcus opened his December 2020 podcast episode featuring Dispenza with an account of how much he’d enjoyed a recent Dispenza retreat in Cancún, which at the time didn’t have COVID travel barriers in place. Dispenza corroborated Marcus’s praise by describing the altar calls at his events, where people testify to being instantly healed of cancer. “We bring children in at the end of the event and we heal them of really serious health conditions,” he said.	</p>
<p>“Our community gets closer,” he said. “You get people opening their heart. Love bonds; you can’t not bond in love. You have to hug, you have to connect, you have to bond.” He told a story of a woman spontaneously cured of Parkinson’s disease in front of 1,500 people. </p>
<p>“When you see that person,” Dispenza said, “stand on the stage and tell that story&mdash;just like an infection can spread amongst the community and create disease, all of a sudden health and wellness are as infectious as disease.” He described one woman who arrived at the event with severe allergies. At the beginning, she was wearing a mask and a ventilator.“In the middle of the event, she’s in the front of the room, dancing around with no mask, no nothing. You start seeing people freeing themselves from their own limitations.”				 </p>
<p>Such infectious “healing” can be costly. Attendance fees for similar events run at around $2,299 per person, before accommodation.	</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="smallcaps">ouis’s return home</span> wasn’t smooth. He told Mary that he was considering freeing himself from the limitations of chemotherapy. He had his meditations from Dispenza, and he was feeling better. Ironically, feeling better was most likely the result of having had to delay a chemotherapy treatment while he’d been away.						</p>
<p>“Outside of him actually dying,” Mary told us, “it was the most devastation I’ve ever felt.” On the one hand, Mary said, it was like Louis was giving up. But giving up on what? “I think that there was a mixed feeling,” Mary said. “I think he wanted to believe that this meditation was working, because he didn’t want to be sick anymore.” </p>
<p>Louis was definitely ready to give up on chemotherapy nausea. Mary knew that the meditation was less painful, more hopeful. That it offered some kind of existential relief, even though, she said, he could beat himself up about not doing it for long enough. When he did manage to meditate, however, it might have allowed him to give up on living in a way that limited shame and demoralization.						</p>
<p>If Dispenza’s meditation had simply been religious in nature, if it had been about accepting death or gratitude or setting one’s moral affairs in order, that would have been one thing. But pseudoscience isn’t honest in that way. It’s one thing pretending to be another. Dispenza was promising healing, spontaneous remission. The former chiropractor, who calls himself a doctor, was giving Louis cover for giving up on real doctors. Dispenza was also giving Louis permission to pretend he was healing himself, with some kind of dignity, even while he was saying goodbye.												</p>
<p>In line with the probabilities, Louis’s condition worsened. “I saw how at peace he was at the end of his life,” she told us. “He was okay. He was content. He wasn’t angry.” Mary felt that he knew he was saved.</p>
<p>Looking back, Mary’s sorrow at Louis’s death has become layered with another mourning. “All of these beliefs carried him to that place,” she said, referring to a spiritual imagination she could never sustain. “I wish I believed the things that he believed. I wish I believed that he was sitting here next to me. I wish I believed those things, because it’s really hard to know that you’re never going to see someone again.”	</p>
<p>“If there was something that would bring me to believe,” she said, remembering how Louis faded away into grace, “I would think it would be this. And it didn’t.” Mary stands where many people stand now, and will stand in the future, as they negotiate with friends and family members who get drawn into the sphere of the Dispenzas. Mary loved a person she knew intimately but didn’t entirely understand. She loved a person whose framework for reality became an island he could not leave and she could not visit. She accepted his unstable beliefs because she knew that giving up those beliefs would have hollowed Louis out in his time of need.			</p>
<p>Through the chaos of a year dominated by cancer, Mary improvised a wisdom, by the skin of her teeth, that has taken seasoned therapists in the cult recovery movement decades to distill. No matter what a person believes, the wisdom goes, nor how harmful it might be to them, the best thing you can do is to love them in a way that an influencer or cult leader never could. To love them without expectation or false promises.	</p>
<p>If there’s some universal source of pain that people like Dispenza pretend to soothe, it is loneliness. That loneliness can curdle into isolation and slowly deprive a person of the ability to trust in medicine, governments, the democratic process, and fellow citizens. If Dispenza accelerates that process for people like Louis, they have to be shown that there are more stable forms of love and care.</p>
<p>Dispenza can’t keep his promises, but a real friend and partner can, and that’s where rebuilding social trust might begin. </p>

I once saw a turtle in Tuktoyaktuk. I remember the owner had brought her dog into a temporary clinic and asked us, “Do you guys see turtles too?” We said, “Of course.” She told us she’d go home and walk with her turtle back to us, but it was March or April&mdash;the ocean was still frozen&mdash;so we arranged a ride for her and her turtle. He was healthy, about three years old. We asked her what he ate, because produce is really expensive in the North. And she told us, “He eats lettuce, but he <em>loves</em> caribou.” </p>
<p>I run a mobile practice, making house calls in Yellowknife and the surrounding areas. I also do veterinary tele­medicine consults for the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Telemedicine for animals in the south has grown during the pandemic, but it’s long been essential to many remote communities in the North. It can be hard for animals to receive care if their owners need to pay thousands of dollars for a flight to Yellowknife. But telemedicine is definitely more challenging for me&mdash;and can be for the owner too, because they may have to act as my assistant. On a video chat, I might ask them to feel their pet’s belly or lift their lip so I can see their gum colour. Or if their dog got bit and I need to look at the wound, then I might teach them how to clean it up and send them antibiotics. </p>

<p>There are so many unique barriers here. To get a CT scan for your pet, you may need to fly to Edmonton. There are thirty-three communities in the Northwest Territories, twelve of which are only accessible by air for most of the year, so the cost of even getting food here is extreme. In the North, grocery prices are high already, but a bag of dog food that costs about $50 in major cities in the south can cost around $130 in some communities here. The dogs we often see are working dogs, who are very important, historically and traditionally, to Indigenous peoples. They can protect their owners from bears and other wildlife out on the land. But they may also be serving a ­companionship role. Pets are also good for mental health through the dark, cold winters. </p>
<p>I haven’t been seeing the same numbers of pet surrenders in the North as elsewhere, but the adoption pool here is very saturated. The SPCA shelter in Yellowknife relies on transferring pets south to be adopted, and we are seeing bottlenecks in those transfers because many of those shelters are full.  </p>
<p>Recently, with more people working from home, many here have adopted animals as companions, and those who already had pets are spending a lot more time with them. That time together can deepen bonds and can also allow people to notice health issues in their pets sooner rather than later. That’s contributed to the increased need for services, and there are only two brick-and-mortar vet clinics in the entire Northwest Territories. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.thewalrus.ca/who-we-are-now/"><img style="width: 100%;" src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/20th-banner-in-article-horizontal.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Many of the issues escalating in the south around access to vet care have long been present in the North, and it’s something we’ve had to navigate in creative ways. One thing I’ve been working on is increasing access to remote communities, and that includes telemedicine. One avenue that we’re exploring at Veterinarians Without Borders Canada is creating a program to train northern residents in animal care first aid, to act as what are known as para-vets. Then they can provide basic care to animals in their own communities. </p>
<p>In veterinary medicine, we’re trying to raise awareness of “One Health,” which is the idea that the health of animals, humans, and the environment is all connected. As we’re trying to increase access to care and awareness of vet medicine in the North, we’re focusing on that interconnectedness. Because if the dogs aren’t healthy, then the people might not be healthy, and that could mean the environment isn’t healthy either. </p>

		<description><![CDATA[Writing down your thoughts can be helpful. But getting the perfect notebook isn’t a substitute for professional care]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="1320" src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Theriault_Journaling_CorinaLo_1200.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="An illustration of a person floating between lined paper in the middle of writing “Dear Diary” on the top margin." loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="" /><p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n the fall</span> of 1962, Sylvia Plath wrote to her mother, “I am a genius of a writer, I have it in me. I am up at 5 writing the best poems of my life. They will make my name.” Before then, she’d struggled to find her voice, writing verse that was stiff and sometimes derivative, but in the months after her separation from husband Ted Hughes, she was able to let go and charge headlong in a new direction. These poems, which would be published posthumously under the title <em>Ariel</em>, were vivid, furious, and personal&mdash;like formal versions of some of the most memorable passages from the journals she’d kept for more than half her life.</p>
<p>Plath began keeping a diary when she was eleven years old and continued to do so right up until her death in 1963 at the age of thirty. She wrote about everything: sex, school, her challenging relationship with her mother. A frequent topic was the tension between her drive to have a career and her desire to be an ideal wife and homemaker&mdash;passages about her publishing successes are written with just as much relish as those about the elaborate meals she cooked for her husband.</p>
<p>Plath used her journals to exult when things were going well, to scold herself when they weren’t, to push herself always to do more, and more, and more. She could be critical, and even cruel, toward herself. One passage from 1953 begins with the words, “Letter to an Over-grown, Over-protected, Scared, Spoiled, Baby.” But when I discovered her journals, the entries that I found most interesting were the ones in which she analyzed (obsessively, often unsparingly) her own feelings. I remember reading her diaries with a shock of recognition. I saw in them the same quality I saw in my own journals: the need to write through any and every experience to unravel its exact meaning. </p>
<ul class="related">

<li><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-mental-health-toll-of-a-pandemic-winter/">The Mental Health Toll of a Pandemic Winter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/what-breaks-up-couples/">As a Therapist, I Know What’s Breaking Couples Up</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t start keeping a journal as a conscious way of coping with stress, but it didn’t take long for me to figure out that, if I was in a bad mental state, writing everything out provided some relief. I now realize that that sense of unravelling, of pulling apart my feelings, is a form of therapeutic journalling. And while people have been chronicling their lives for thousands of years, journalling as a wellness practice has experienced a recent boom. As countries started locking down at the start of the <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> pandemic, many people turned to journalling as a sort of therapy&mdash;a space to vent and lament over the challenges of living through unprecedented times. A representative of the California-based lifestyle brand ban.do told a reporter they saw a 37.5 percent increase in journal sales from the previous year in the first four months of the pandemic alone&mdash;a figure similar to those of other brands across the country, <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21542132/journaling-bullet-journal-coronavirus-pandemic" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to <em>Vox</em>.</a> </p>
<p>Journalling can be a valuable tool, and it’s quickly become a very popular one. But if so many of us are working out our feelings in notebooks, shouldn’t we all be feeling a whole lot better? </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smallcaps">iaries, or journals,</span> as we understand them today&mdash;that is, regularly kept records of someone’s life, thoughts, and feelings&mdash;first started in Japan in the tenth or eleventh century. In the West, they didn’t appear until the early modern period. Samuel Pepys, one of the best known early diarists, is probably most famous for his accounts of the Great Plague of London and the Great Fire (<a href="https://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/09/04/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">he even wrote about burying cheese and wine in his garden to save them from the flames</a>), but he also included very personal passages, like descriptions of fights he had with his wife and details about his frequent infidelities. The latter type of entry was often recorded in French and/or Spanish; an example from 1666 reads, “And thence to the Abbey, and so to Mrs. Martin and there did what je voudrais avec her, both devante and backward, which is also muy bon plazer.”</p>
<p>Journalling continued to gain traction during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but it wasn’t until the early nineteenth century, when several diaries&mdash;including Pepys’s&mdash;were published, that the practice really exploded. But while people have long used journalling as a processing tool, its formal use as a widespread therapeutic practice didn’t begin until 1966, when American psychotherapist Ira Progoff developed a program he called the Intensive Journal Method. Progoff had realized early on that journalling can have tangible benefits for <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/mental-health/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mental health</a> by reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression and boosting emotional regulation. Evidence also suggests that having a regular journalling practice can improve memory function. </p>
<p>Since Progoff’s time, many different systems of therapeutic journalling have been created. One of the best known is that of Kathleen Adams, author of the 1990 bestseller <em>Journal to the Self</em>.</p>
<p>Adams received her first diary (which she describes as “the kind with a lock you could pick with a bobby pin”) for Christmas when she was ten years old, marking the beginning of a lifelong practice. Years later, when she entered a master’s program in psychology and counselling at the Boulder Graduate School in Colorado, her use of her writing as a processing tool became so well known among her friends that they began asking her to teach them how to journal in the same way. She went through her old notebooks to see if she could pick out a few helpful writing techniques, turning her methodology into a twelve-hour workshop. The response was overwhelmingly positive. Adams had found her calling.</p>
<p>Not long after, Adams began working at a psychiatric hospital, running an in-patient journalling program for women with post-traumatic stress disorder, most of whom had experienced severe trauma beginning in childhood. Many of the women had tried journalling before but had struggled with feelings of re-traumatization when doing so.</p>
<p>“The number one thing that they told me was that, often when they were trying to write about their trauma and understand it, they described this process of falling off a cliff or going to a deep and dark place that they can’t get out of,” said Adams. “Many of them were doing stream-of-consciousness writing, but I realized that, in trauma work, what these women really needed was structure, pacing, and containment. At least to begin with.”</p>
<p>When Adams left hospital work and moved into private practice, she discovered that her journalling program wasn’t just helpful for people diagnosed with PTSD but was also an effective clinical model for all kinds of mental health issues. In fact, there are only a handful of people for whom Adams wouldn’t recommend journalling: people who are experiencing disordered thinking (that is, thoughts that aren’t rational to other people), since writing in that state can take them deeper into those thoughts; people with highly manipulative tendencies, as they’re no more likely to be honest in their journals than they are in real life; and, finally, people who are struggling with impulse control in a specific area (for example, trying not to drink or have a cigarette), since writing about what they’re craving can sometimes turn into rationalizing why they should give into it. Otherwise, she believes journalling can be a powerful tool for just about anybody.</p>
<p>In the years since Adams published her first book, therapeutic journalling has gained enormous popularity. You can now find resources that cater to just about any social condition. There are guided journals for soldiers, for Catholics, for students, for grieving parents, and almost any other group you can think of. The practice has been embraced by the larger wellness industry, and it’s not hard to see why: therapy is expensive, and notebooks are comparatively cheap. But, as in the case of many other things associated with the wellness movement, journalling for mental health can feel like a bit of a double-edged sword: it can be helpful, but it’s no substitute for proper care overseen by a licensed practitioner. It can also feed into the idea that if we can just buy the perfect notebook and invest in the right routine, all of our mental health problems will be solved. </p>
<p>I started journalling when I was eleven years old, which is also around the same time that I started to really struggle with feelings of hopelessness and unworthiness. My first diary was a bright-orange Hilroy notebook with a picture of a marten glued onto the front. I chronicled the social upheavals of my small group of friends and my own uncertainty about how to handle them. By the time I was in high school, I’d switched from lined notebooks to hardbound sketchbooks in dark colours, which seemed better suited to my adolescent scrawl. These days, I’m a sucker for Moleskine-style notebooks, though I still prefer them to be unlined. </p>
<p>I don’t follow any specific therapeutic formula. I just write my way through whatever stressful thing I’m experiencing until I’ve finally figured out how I really feel about it. Sometimes it turns out that I’m actually upset about something completely different than whatever set me off, and sometimes I just write in circles until I’ve exhausted myself. Either way, the act of sitting down and committing it all to paper gives me enough space from my original heightened state that I feel like I can take a breath. But that breath doesn’t last long&mdash;journalling offers me only a temporary reprieve at best. And I have to admit that after years of trying to navigate mental health care in Canada, I’m burned out on solutions that put more responsibility onto people just trying to survive. </p>
<p>To say that the system is broken feels glib but, for proof, look no further than the numbers. In 2019, the average national wait time between a general practitioner’s referral and an appointment with a psychiatrist was nearly eleven weeks, while the average wait time between the appointment with the psychiatrist and the beginning of treatment was nearly fourteen weeks. That means that the overall time between seeing your family doctor and beginning treatment is over six months. For some provinces, wait times are disproportionately longer&mdash;like in Nova Scotia, where it typically takes over a year to receive treatment. </p>
<p>For those who do manage to endure the wait time, the options are often limited when it comes to treatment. Talk therapy and/or counselling is not covered by any provincial health plans unless it’s done by a medical doctor or through a medical clinic, but such programs are few and far between. Meanwhile, the average cost of private psychotherapy runs upward of $100 per session. To state plainly, these are resources that are out of reach for many Canadians. </p>
<p>Beyond the issues of scarcity and cost, the system can be incredibly complex to navigate. Margaret Eaton, national CEO of the Canadian Mental Health Association, has told the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/canada-mental-health-crisis-covid-19-pandemic-1.6382378&#038;sa=D&#038;source=docs&#038;ust=1685995231315700&#038;usg=AOvVaw30ilyWLMk36Xo7Sf2ouVIw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CBC</a> that it’s a “patchwork quilt” of services. If you have a primary care physician (and 6 million Canadians do not), you might start there for a referral, but that’s just the mouth of the labyrinth. Once you enter the system, you’ll likely face wait lists, assessments, tests, invasive personal questions, and piles of paperwork, all while you’re struggling with debilitating psychiatric symptoms. </p>
<p>So I’ll admit that I bristle a bit when discussions about mental health involve suggesting things like journalling to people who are struggling. Of course, everyone has some responsibility for their own health, and mood-boosting activities like going for walks, taking baths, or going to the gym certainly have their place in a daily routine. On the other hand, what does it say about our existing mental health support systems if so many people are left to cobble together their own solutions?</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smallcaps">hile Sylvia Plath&#8217;s writing</span> is well regarded, she’s arguably most famous for her death by suicide. So often when we talk about Plath’s death, we can make it seem fated, inevitable. But the reality is that she was not passive in her crisis. In fact, she was doing everything she could to survive it. She wrote prolifically in her last months&mdash;letters to friends and family, part of a second novel, the poems she told her mother would make her name, and a final journal, which was destroyed posthumously by her husband.</p>
<p>What often gets left out of that part of her story is the fact that she was fighting to get care right up until her last days. She was attending regular doctor’s appointments. She was trying new medication. She was reaching out to friends for support. She was doing everything we tell people to do when they’re struggling with their mental health.</p>
<p>In her last days, Plath was on a wait list to receive in-patient psychiatric treatment. When her doctor had tried to have her admitted at several hospitals, he was told that all the beds were full. In the end, her writing couldn’t save her. She needed real, substantial medical care.  A person alone with their journal can only do so much.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/mental-health-journal/">Does Journalling Actually Improve Mental Health?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

That doesn&#8217;t mean the pandemic is over.  With the virus continuing to spread and new variants breaking out, it’s widely accepted that the disease is probably here to stay. Among other public health measures, vaccines are key to allowing us to potentially live with it as an endemic disease. But evenly distributing them has proven trickier than perhaps it should be. </p>
<p>As of February, about 83 percent of people in upper-middle-income countries have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, compared with a little over a quarter of the population in low-income countries&mdash;partially because pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, sold the majority of their vaccines to rich countries earlier in the pandemic. The consequences have been devastating: according to a March 2022 Oxfam report, for every life lost due to COVID-19 in a rich country, another four people died in poorer nations.</p>
<p>In a highly connected and globalized world, the best way to contain a pandemic is to control it in every country. “If the virus is anywhere, it’s everywhere,” says Alan Bernstein, former president and CEO of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and a member of Canada’s COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force. Low vaccination rates in some regions may have supported the worldwide proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron. A study published last fall in the journal <em>Nature Medicine</em> calculated that if vaccines had been proportionally distributed at the start of 2021, based on the size of each country’s unvaccinated population, an estimated 1.3 million lives would have been saved worldwide by the end of that year.</p>

</ul>
<p>Inequity is ingrained in the economic and political systems under which vaccines are made and distributed. For a country to have enough vaccines for its population without relying on donations, it must be able to develop and manufacture its own or have the money to buy them. If there is to be any hope of better weathering future pandemics, the way countries produce and procure vaccines needs to change radically. The good news is we already know how to do that.  </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="smallcaps">ew countries</span> have the industry, infrastructure, manufacturing capacity, and technical know-how to produce vaccines from start to finish. Canada has limited vaccine-making capabilities despite having a strong biotechnology research community, a legacy of its research and scientific expertise dating back to the early twentieth century. At the time, the country was at the forefront of the vaccine industry, in part thanks to Connaught Laboratories. Founded as the Antitoxin Laboratory in 1914 at the University of Toronto, the facility started producing vaccines for diphtheria and tetanus in the 1920s, typhus during the Second World War, and polio in the 1950s. But a combination of factors, including changes in Connaught’s ownership and shifts in the vaccine market, severely restricted the country’s production capabilities. Connaught was sold in 1972 to the Canada Development Corporation, a Crown corporation designed to promote Canadian business, and was then completely privatized a few years later under prime minister Brian Mulroney’s government. It now operates under French multinational Sanofi.</p>
<p>“For decades, we neglected to rebuild our vaccine-manufacturing capacity,” says Bernstein. During the scramble for COVID-19 vaccines, Canadians had to wait. Vaccination campaigns in countries with larger markets and greater domestic production capabilities, including the United States and the United Kingdom, sped ahead, while rollout in Canada was painfully slow. But our deep pockets meant that we were still near the front of the line. </p>
<p>Countries in the Global South, such as South Africa, Argentina, and Uganda, were pushed to the back. In April 2020, three premier global health organizations partnered with UNICEF to launch COVAX, a joint venture intended as an antidote to vaccine inequity. The plan was for countries to pool money into the program, which would then negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to secure doses for all participating nations. This would allow COVAX to act as a global distribution warehouse, allocating vaccines where needed and shipping them to rich and poor countries simultaneously. The reality was far from it. </p>
<p>Spearheaded by Gavi, a Geneva-based vaccine funder backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, along with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, another Gates-funded nonprofit, and the WHO, COVAX bought vaccines from companies at negotiated prices and provided them to lower-income countries for free. But the program faced hurdles at a scale Gavi had never encountered previously.  </p>
<p>“Gavi never challenges the monopoly,” says Varsha Gandikota-Nellutla, policy coordinator at Progressive International, a coalition of advocacy groups, political parties, publications, and research centres that launched in May 2020 and has been campaigning for equitable access to vaccines. “It’s never really had to account for this problem of everyone wanting scarce resources at the same time.” By mid-2021, only seven vaccine makers had received approval from the WHO, and a perceived hierarchy soon emerged. Initial reports of rare side effects from the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines led to public hesitancy, increasing demand for the limited supplies of the rest. Many lower-income countries purchased doses of the Sinopharm and Corona-Vac vaccines, both of which are developed in China. Some studies have suggested they may provide less effective long-term protection against serious illness when compared with mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer-BioNTech’s or Moderna’s.</p>
<p>Some rich nations, including Canada, undermined COVAX by putting money into it but then pursuing separate bilateral negotiations with pharmaceutical companies to get their vaccines first. In early 2021, Canada was poised to take 1.9 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from COVAX by the middle of that year. According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/29/canada-and-uk-among-countries-with-most-vaccine-doses-ordered-per-person" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the <em>Guardian</em></a>, by the end of January, Canada had already secured agreements with several companies for about 362 million doses. That fall, analytics firm Airfinity estimated that Canada, the US, the UK, the European Union, and Japan would have a cumulative 1.2 billion surplus shots by the end of the year. A June 2022 report by Oxfam and the People’s Vaccine Alliance, an international group committed to ensuring vaccine access, found that just under half of the donations those same governments had promised to lower-income countries had been delivered. The report called Canada one of the “worst offenders,” as it had delivered only about 15.4 million doses by June, even though, according to data from Doctors Without Borders, it had promised 50.7 million by the end of the year. Such shortfalls contributed to delaying vaccinations in lower-income countries: by the time 20 percent of the UK’s population had received their first dose, for example, says Gandikota-Nellutla, “not a single dose had gone out through COVAX to anywhere else in the world.” </p>
<p>“This charity approach was exactly what we were trying to avoid,” says Diana Sarosi, director of policy and campaigns for Oxfam Canada. At times, the donated vaccines were close to expiry or were considered by some countries to be less desirable. In Europe and North America, some governments began to pause or completely stop the use of AstraZeneca vaccines in 2021, says Fatima Hassan, a human rights lawyer and director of the Cape Town–based nonprofit Health Justice Initiative, but some countries continued to donate AstraZeneca doses to the rest of the world. “Why do we have to choose different vaccines to what’s being rolled out in Canada or the US?” </p>
<p>At the same time, some countries with domestic manufacturing capabilities were prevented from producing their own vaccines, in part by intellectual property restrictions. Vaccines are complicated pieces of technology that can involve multiple patents; Moderna, for example, has hundreds of mRNA vaccine&ndash;related patents issued in several countries. In October 2020, even before the WHO approved the first COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, India and South Africa co-petitioned the World Trade Organization (WTO) to grant member nations a temporary waiver so that they could choose not to enforce certain intellectual property rights connected to the prevention, containment, and treatment of COVID-19. This would give countries permission to produce generic vaccines domestically without fear of lawsuits from pharmaceutical companies. (The question of who owns the rights to vaccine technology is complicated; in August 2022, Moderna sued Pfizer and BioNTech for alleged infringement of its mRNA-technology patents.) </p>
<p>Over a hundred governments, mostly of low- and middle-income countries, supported the waiver, but discussions were stalled due to opposition from the EU and some high-income nations, including the UK. Opponents of the petition argued that waiving IP rights alone would not automatically speed up the production of vaccines, as pharmaceutical companies would still have to share their technology and scientific know-how with potential manufacturers. A waiver, they added, might also disincentivize companies from future investment in research and development and hinder pharmaceutical innovation. </p>
<p>In June 2022, the WTO passed a watered-down version of the original proposal that did not extend to companies’ proprietary information or technical know-how. The waiver also did not cover COVID-19 testing kits or treatments. “In the end, it was very anticlimactic,” says Sarosi, who advocated for the waiver. “It was so late at that point that it almost didn’t matter anymore.”</p>
<p>Uneven vaccine distribution has shaped the arc of other recent disease outbreaks. Take, for example, mpox (formerly known as monkeypox), which has spread to over 100 countries since the start of 2022. When the outbreak began, Imvamune, which is one of three main smallpox vaccines being used to offer protection against the mpox virus, was already available. In press conferences last July, the WHO estimated that roughly 16 million doses had been produced by the vaccine’s sole manufacturer, Denmark-based Bavarian Nordic. But most of these were held by or promised to high-income countries. As of early February this year, there were still no vaccines available in Central and West Africa, where the mpox virus had become endemic after being first identified in humans in 1970. A call from advocacy groups for Bavarian Nordic to share vaccine know-how and for manufacturers around the world to help fill and package bulk doses has so far largely gone unanswered. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">hings are</span> starting to change. Less than 1 percent of all vaccines used in Africa are produced on the continent, but there has been a concerted push over the past few years toward increasing regional capacity. In June 2021, the first COVID-19 mRNA vaccine technology transfer hub was established in South Africa. The project brings together the WHO and its collaborators, as well as industry partners, universities, and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, with the goal of training and licensing manufacturers from low- and middle-income countries to implement the new technology and enable local production. The hub created its own version of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in early 2022.</p>
<p>Canada, too, is looking to ease its reliance on foreign sources of vaccines. In the summer of 2021, the federal government announced an investment of more than $2.2 billion over seven years to go toward initiatives in the bio-manufacturing and life sciences industry.</p>
<p>Bernstein welcomes the wide-ranging investment. But, in his view, a public health emergency response shouldn’t be left solely to private pharmaceutical companies. He envisions a national vaccine facility which brings together research from Canadian universities, expertise from biopharmaceutical companies, and infrastructure to produce enough vaccines for every Canadian and also to export doses to countries that cannot manufacture their own. The facility could be used by the private sector during normal times, he says, but during a crisis, it would be commandeered by the federal government for large-scale vaccine deployment.<br />
“We don’t wait for a fire to have a fire department,” says Bernstein. But pandemic preparedness isn’t just about having the means to fight a virus; countries have to come together to extinguish it everywhere. “You can’t put a fire half out,” he says. “It’s either out or not.” </p>

At this point, the doctors and nurses around me were starting to get concerned about the baby’s dropping heart rate, but there was little communication about additional interventions.</p>
<p>I knew from reading economist Emily Oster’s work (2014’s <em>Expecting Better</em>, 2019’s <em>Cribsheet</em>) in the nine months leading up to this moment that vaginal trauma can be much more likely in the event of an episiotomy&mdash;the widely feared incision of the perineum that can help the baby come out. I knew that although the procedure used to be common, its routine use is no longer recommended by medical organizations. More importantly, I knew what I wanted for my own body. </p>
<p>Nobody around me seemed to be having a similar academic revelation; in fact, the man with the scissors just kept inching further into the room. I quickly realized that he was the same man I had asked to leave the birthing room several hours earlier after he performed one too many rough cervical exams without even a word of warning. “Honestly, guys,” I said in between gasping breaths, “what the fuck is he doing here?”</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="dropcap">N</span><span class="smallcaps">obody can prepare</span> you for how it feels when a health care professional ignores your pain or your concerns&mdash;even when you’re <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5845507/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">familiar</a> with the literature, have <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180518-the-inequality-in-how-women-are-treated-for-pain" rel="noopener" target="_blank">heard</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/emergency-room-wait-times-sexism/410515/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read</a> countless <a href="https://this.org/2017/04/11/thousands-of-canadian-women-are-dismissed-by-their-doctors-because-of-their-gender/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anecdotes</a>, and have experienced this personally to the point that you have become trained to expect it. In her new book, <em>Bleed: Destroying Myths and Misogyny in Endometriosis Care</em>, journalist Tracey Lindeman chronicles her own and others’ experiences living with endometriosis and the Sisyphean task of getting basic acknowledgement of their suffering&mdash;never mind adequate care. With at least 190 million people around the world currently suffering from it, according to the World Health Organization, endometriosis has become a case study for how the medical system fails women in exactly this way. (When I use “women” here, as Lindeman does, I’m referring to <em>all</em> women, not just those assigned female at birth.)</p>
<p>As Lindeman writes, endometriosis is “a disease defined by the growth of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus. These growths&mdash;called endometriomas, lesions and adhesions&mdash;attach to ovaries, fallopian tubes and the exterior of the uterus, as well as the bowel and sometimes as far away as the kidneys, diaphragm, lungs and in rare cases, the brain.” Endometriosis is a chronic, often debilitating condition. The tissue growths, despite being outside the uterus, act just as endometrial tissues do: they thicken, break down, and bleed with each menstrual cycle. There is no naturally occurring biological process to rid the body of these rogue tissues or defend it against the damage they can inflict. Symptoms vary widely but can often include heavy and painful periods, scar tissue, adhesions (bands of scar-like tissue that can cause internal organs to stick together), pain during sex, difficulty with bowel movements and urination, reduced fertility, and severe pelvic pain. “Some people don’t know they have it. Others <em>know</em> they have it but haven’t persuaded the right people to give them a diagnosis,” Lindeman writes. “In North America, and much of the Westernized world, people spend an average of seven to ten years trying to get properly diagnosed.” Unsurprisingly, women of colour face an even steeper uphill battle when it comes to getting their pain taken seriously.</p>
<p><em>Bleed</em> is part memoir, part history, part investigative journalism&mdash;and all searing, acerbic prose. Lindeman includes stories of other people suffering from endometriosis, following each experience so closely that it feels like learning about a friend’s painful, secret second life. She skillfully connects their journeys with recent data on the costs and efficacy of and the trade-offs necessary to pursue pain medication, birth control, hormonal modulators, or surgery as treatment options. Along the way, she clocks the consequences of gatekeeping in medicine and of pharmaceutical-company corruption. </p>
<p>In a climate where abortion and contraceptive access in the United States are under more threat than they have been in fifty years&mdash;and at a time when nobody can afford to mince words about women having access to the care they need and deserve&mdash;<em>Bleed</em> arrives in full force, exposing the raw and isolating experience of living with a feminized disease in a world that doesn’t want to acknowledge women’s pain. Lindeman does a great service to her readers by showing them they are not alone in their struggles and by sharing everything she has learned about how best to navigate the health care system, but she stops short of giving false hope. “I wish I could tell you that being an empowered patient gets me respect or better treatment,” Lindeman writes, “but it doesn’t.”</p>
<p>I don’t have endometriosis but do have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), so I understand what it means to live with pain that is misdiagnosed, minimized, and, frankly, dismissed as a figment of my imagination. Like endometriosis, PCOS is a condition that primarily affects women, and as such, the research around causes, treatment, and cures is chronically underfunded. “This problem runs all the way through research into women’s health,” writes Angela Saini, author of <em>Inferior: How Science Got Women Wrong&mdash;and the New Research That’s Rewriting the Story</em>. “If a phenomenon affects women and only women, it’s all too often misunderstood.” </p>
<p>This is a well-established problem in medicine, where conditions and diseases that primarily affect men are given more attention and funding than those affecting women, and the consequence is that doctors often don’t know how to diagnose the latter&mdash;if they even believe you are sick in the first place. But the problem began much earlier, with modern medicine being developed with male physiology as the default. This underrepresentation in the research has resulted in poor understanding of how women’s bodies work and respond to treatments, which in turn has led to misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment, and lack of access to effective care. For instance, women more frequently than men present with nausea and indigestion before and at the onset of a heart attack, symptoms that are considered “atypical” because research based on male physiology found hallmark symptoms to be pain or discomfort in the left arm and chest. As a result, women have been found to be 50 percent more likely than men to be misdiagnosed following a heart attack and more likely than men to die from heart attacks.</p>
<p>Studies suggest that gender bias in medicine often leads to female patients being denied pain relief for a range of health conditions. A US analysis of 981 emergency-room visits showed that women with acute abdominal pain were 13 to 25 percent less likely than their male counterparts to be treated with opioid painkillers. According to an article on Harvard University’s <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/women-and-pain-disparities-in-experience-and-treatment-2017100912562" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a>, “Women in pain are much more likely than men to receive prescriptions for sedatives, rather than pain medication, for their ailments.” And sometimes they’re much less likely than men to be prescribed painkillers after surgery. </p>
<p>Many women are leaving health care interactions feeling neglected, uncared for, and, worst of all, being made to feel like their pain, their concerns, and their knowledge about their own bodies aren’t real or relevant. If it goes on long enough, that kind of strain will take you down one of two roads: giving up entirely on seeking help and living in depression and collapse, or in a state of fight, jacked up on the cortisol and stress. </p>
<p>After so many years of struggling to get her pain acknowledged and her endometriosis under control, Lindeman ended up in the latter category&mdash;she felt like a cornered animal any time she walked into a doctor’s office: “I’d been gaslit for so long that every new doctor felt like a new adversary, someone I had to fight.” </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smallcaps">ith the sound</span> of my angry question ringing in the air, the medical staff in the delivery room barely raised their heads from their work. “Oh, he’s just here in case we need him,” one of them said reassuringly, fussing with my IV. “Nothing is happening yet.” I was furious. I gripped the sides of the hospital bed, hauled myself a little more upright, and screamed, “I want that man out of here right now! Right now! He is not coming anywhere near me. Get me another doctor right now and explain to me what is going on.” I kept screaming for what felt like many long minutes, demanding to know what was about to happen to my body, but I suppose a woman screaming in a birthing suite is so expected that the actual words I said didn’t register.  </p>
<p>It wasn’t until my partner (a man), who was sweating from an hour of holding my legs back as I tried to push our son out, quietly said, “I think she just wants a little more communication from you guys. Maybe just let her know what your plans are and have a quick conversation first?” that, suddenly, there was a flurry of activity. </p>
<p>A different doctor, a woman, approached my bedside and looked me in the eye, her expression soft. “I’m going to explain your options to you,” she said calmly. “We are getting concerned about the baby’s decelerating heart rate. We can see him, he’s crowning, but you’ve been pushing for almost two hours now and the birth isn’t progressing.” She paused. “First:” she said, “we can perform the episiotomy to help the baby come out.”</p>
<p>“No,” I said firmly.</p>
<p>“Second: we can have you push a little longer with some adjusted breathing techniques.”</p>
<p>“Fine.” </p>
<p>“If the pushing doesn’t progress and his heart rate continues to decelerate, we can use a vacuum extractor.” I considered this, knowing that this type of intervention would increase my chances of having more severe vaginal tearing, while also factoring that I hadn’t felt my son’s ninety-eighth-percentile-sized head move in the past two hours. “Okay, I’m good with that,” I said. </p>
<p>Around thirty minutes later, my eight-pound, ten-ounce son was born via vacuum extraction, with the umbilical cord wrapped around his little neck. I was so relieved to see him when he was placed on my chest that it took a few minutes before I looked down and realized Scissor Man was sitting sullenly between my legs, sewing me up. I lay back, resigned, and let him finish.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> <span class="smallcaps">couple of years ago</span>, veteran journalists and colleagues Maria Aspan and Erika Fry started having conversations about a theme that kept emerging in their reporting: “Why is women’s health so under-researched, underfunded, and underserved?” Their curiosity about these questions helped them secure a grant from the National Institute for Healthcare Management (NIHCM) Foundation for a series of articles. What they found painted a <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/01/11/jada-system-medicine-gender-bias-health-care/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bleak picture</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Women account for more than half of the population [in the US] and 80% of all health care purchasing decisions. They take more prescription drugs than men do and more often go to the doctor. But despite their market power, women have largely been treated like an afterthought or inconvenience&mdash;at best&mdash;for the $4.3 trillion [in 2021] American health care market. Only 5% of all biopharma R&#038;D spending goes towards female-specific conditions, most of which are cancer-related. (Take out oncology and it drops to 1%.) A paltry 13 percent of cardiovascular clinical trial participants are women, even though heart disease is the leading cause of death for women in the US. And for all the buzz about femtech, the numbers aren’t better in the start-up ecosystem: In 2021, women’s health accounted for only 5% of all digital health investment in the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>When clear, capitalistic information like this demonstrates that women are an attractive market but hardly anyone is tripping over themselves to make a dollar, you start to wonder what other forces are at play. If you are a woman and you sit with that question long enough, you know the truth at the heart of it is in the history of subjugation of your gender, a subjugation that continues today. And if you are a woman and you sit with those thoughts long enough, a deep-seated anger roils inside you that is difficult to quiet. “So often we are told to lie back and take it,” Lindeman writes with power and precision in <em>Bleed</em>. “We must accept the things we cannot change, lest our anger consume us. But why <em>not</em> be consumed? There is a certain utility in consumption. When focused, anger can be a catalyst and an engine for change. The systems that oppress us benefit from our silence and compliance, and they make us complicit in our own abuse by forcing us to engage on their terms.” </p>
<p>There is a seething, surging anger that radiates from every sentence in Lindeman’s book. Reading it, I felt as if the author was standing inches away from my face and screaming into it. Initially, I recoiled. I was wholly uncomfortable with her bold expression. I even chastened her in my mind for not finding another way to relay her story. By the end, though, I came to realize that the tenor and pitch of her writing exactly matched the tenor and pitch of the anger that flared and faltered inside me when I sat with my own experiences. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smallcaps">hen I tell</span> my birthing story to friends or family, I like to tell it like I had a baby in a boxing ring: advocating loudly and successfully for myself, fighting off negligent medical professionals with the same athletic stamina that carried me through twenty-six hours of labour. I went into the experience expecting my concerns to be disregarded (and knowing that being biracial wasn’t going to help my chances) so I felt prepared, and maybe even a little excited, to meet the challenge. But the truth, once it was written down, was very different. I had to face the reality of my experience in order to accurately portray it: I fought valiantly and accomplished something incredible, but I was still vulnerable. I still needed my partner to advocate for me in order to have my needs met and my voice heard, and that knowledge is uncomfortable to hold. </p>
<p>There is a strong possibility that some readers will see the bold, red capital letters of the title of Lindeman’s book in bookstores and turn away. The book is an evidence file for female pain, and the idea that women exaggerate their pain has been used to override women’s complaints for centuries and continues to inform how any expression of strong emotion is perceived. There is another possible world where people who are living with endometriosis&mdash;or any other condition that affects female bodies&mdash;will pick up the book and see themselves and their suffering reflected in its pages, and that will be meaningful. Considering the potential impact of Lindeman’s book reminded me of a passage in Rebecca Solnit’s book <em>Hope in the Dark</em> about how the project of writing and sharing your work with the world is akin to the idea of hope, because both happen in a space of uncertainty:  </p>
<blockquote><p>An essay, a book, is one statement in a long conversation you could call culture or history; you are answering something or questioning something that may have fallen silent long ago, and the response to your words may come long after you’re gone and never reach your ears, if anyone hears you in the first place&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;This is a model for how indirect effect can be, how delayed, how invisible; no one is more hopeful than a writer, no one is a bigger gambler.</p></blockquote>
<p>The positive consequences of our actions are not always immediately measurable. What gives me no small measure of hope is that there are people like Lindeman who are willing to hone and direct their angry energy into something useful, even if they won’t see the fruits of their labour themselves. That in itself is an act of hope. As Lindeman herself writes: “Anger is a power plant that can generate energy that spurs us to action. You can use it to make a difference&mdash;if not for yourself, then for someone else.”</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/why-does-the-medical-system-keep-failing-people-with-endometriosis/">Why Does the Medical System Keep Failing People with Endometriosis?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

I covered many community and social issues but kept returning to people’s experiences of psychiatric detention and forced treatment. Eventually, I began writing for news outlets with American audiences as well, and my investigations of civil commitment became continent wide.</p>
<p>One of the first people I ever interviewed who’d been involuntarily treated was Gerald McVeigh, a burly, bearded, fifty-eight-year-old. He’d been working as a logger in centuries-old Pacific Northwest rainforests when a dispute developed over a possible clear-cut. Environmentalists and police clashed. Tangled between his own environmental sensitivity and need for more money to meet alimony payments, McVeigh was stressed and barely eating or sleeping when he argued with his boss and got fired.</p>
<p>At home in Victoria and still not sleeping, McVeigh got thrust into a heightened state where his senses, thoughts, and emotions intensified, and events took on mystical symbolism. For hours, he washed himself and his apartment as if cleansing his spirit. “At one point, I was chatting with God!” McVeigh told me. “I was having all sorts of delusions. I guess delusions.”</p>

</ul>
<p>But the energy also brought fear&mdash;what was happening? McVeigh fled into the street seeking reassuring interpersonal connections. When he became afraid of losing eye contact with a friendly woman, she called the police. Even as they interrogated him, McVeigh simply turned away to follow her again. Someone grabbed him. McVeigh panicked.</p>
<p>“A police officer put a choke hold on me,” said McVeigh. “I thought, this was it, I was fighting for my life. I fought so hard I shat myself and pissed myself. It took six of them to get me in the paddy wagon. I had shackles around my ankles, I was handcuffed behind my back.”</p>
<p>He was calmer by the time the police van arrived at the psychiatric hospital. He was briefly interviewed, promptly committed, and forcibly drugged with the tranquilizing antipsychotic haloperidol.</p>
<p>The drug made him mentally numbed and physically exhausted, McVeigh said. He spent hours and days alternately sitting and wandering in a white-walled, window-barred sterile hospital ward with a central television droning constantly. No one spoke with him about what he’d been going through. “If somebody’d given me a hug, I’d have been happy!” he told me.</p>
<p>McVeigh described feeling trapped in a “hell” of humiliating powerlessness. He soon realized that the only way he’d get his freedom back was if he started behaving as “normally” as he could&mdash;so he did, despite feeling stranger than before he’d been brought in. </p>
<p>Upon discharge, McVeigh was told that he had bipolar disorder and needed to take antipsychotics for the rest of his life. Instead, he read <em>Toxic Psychiatry</em>, psychiatrist Peter Breggin’s book about the harms of common treatments, and <em>Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament</em> by Kay Redfield Jamison, a psychologist labelled with bipolar disorder who believed the condition fuelled many artists and thinkers. McVeigh stopped taking the drugs, moved to a remote north-coast squatters’ encampment, and decompressed over six months.</p>
<p>In the decades since, McVeigh has usually been settled, occasionally lived out of his car, and gotten briefly involuntarily hospitalized during several other difficult periods. In 2021, passing eighty years of age, he was still speaking out against forced treatment. “They don’t treat you as an intelligent human being.” </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">racy Myers’s story</span> started very differently. A slim, animated woman with shoulder-length dark hair, Myers was thirty when she was sexually assaulted twice while travelling. At a hostel, she became unwilling to get out of bed. “I was lying in the fetal position, shut down and so scared,” she said. “I felt like a small child.” She imagined things that would then manifest before her eyes. She believed she could quickly walk a thousand miles back to a safe place she’d visited.</p>
<p>Myers allowed herself to be taken to a psychiatric hospital, where her experience was strikingly similar to McVeigh’s&mdash;right down to the droning television and forced drugging with haloperidol. Nurses behaved professionally enough but mostly stayed behind glass walls, handed out drugs in paper cups, and spoke to patients as if to children. Many of the other patients were slack jawed and shuffling, she said, and there were no therapists asking about her feelings. She recalled pleading in vain to be allowed outside to walk in fresh air.</p>
<p>At one point, Myers had severe neck spasms. “In the middle of the night, my head started to twist to the right further and further, and I couldn’t stop it. It went on for about an hour. It was as if someone was wringing me out.” She was terrified she’d become the possessed girl from <em>The Exorcist</em>. She only learned later from a fellow patient it was an antipsychotic side effect.</p>
<p>Myers got transferred to a hospital closer to home where a doctor was a family friend. The psychiatrist expressed shock at the amount of haloperidol she was on and promptly discontinued the drug and discharged her. A friend invited Myers to help with a log cabin he was building in the wilderness. “For a month I hauled wood up this mountain and physically worked,” said Myers. “It got me back into my body. That was the best kind of therapy I could have.”</p>
<p>Most psychiatrists used to be extensively trained in talk therapy and other techniques. However, after the discovery of “neuroleptic” drugs with anesthetizing effects in the 1950s (later marketed as “tranquilizers” and then “antipsychotics”), political pushes by psychiatric guilds alongside new legislation and policy changes reinforced a trend of hospitals hiring primarily biomedical psychiatrists. By the 1990s, psychoanalysts, psychologists, psychotherapists, and other non-medical <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/mental-health/">mental health</a> specialists had much diminished roles or no presence at all in most psychiatric hospitals. Yet Myers was the first to tell me what I’d soon learn abundant evidence shows&mdash;that altered states with spiritual tones like McVeigh’s and traumatized states like Myers’s are common among psychiatric patients, and many would prefer to explore their feelings in hopes of understanding their meaning and finding healing. They often don’t want invasive biomedical treatments like tranquilizers and electroshock therapy and don’t respond well to them. Such people get “coerced, pressured, forced,” said Myers. “Their lives can become unmitigated terror.”</p>
<p>Myers later attended a public reading by Vancouver author Irit Shimrat, who recounted her own experiences with unusual states of consciousness and forced treatment. Myers described it as “revolutionary” for her to see a talented, intelligent woman speaking “without shame” about madness. “I remember just weeping listening to her. I had never talked with anybody about the kind of thoughts I’d had. The most painful thing for me was the isolation and loneliness.” Myers met McVeigh at the event, and they launched a group for people to share their experiences of unusual states and forced treatment.</p>
<p>Myers went on to work at a nonprofit as a counsellor for children who’d been exposed to violence, and she then went into private practice. She did not take psychotropics and was never again psychiatrically hospitalized. When we talked in 2021, I asked if she still felt the same way about involuntary treatment.</p>
<p>“People are suffering,” she said. “The idea that sticking them in a cell and giving them drugs is a solution for this is insanity.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smallcaps">uring that period,</span> I also interviewed Irit Shimrat, the author of <em>Call Me Crazy: Stories from the Mad Movement</em>, a history of modern activism against forced treatment, and sometime editor of various long-running periodicals written by patients and ex-patients. Shimrat educated me about “consumers” who identify as willing clients of mental health services, “survivors” who identify as unwilling victims of those “services,” and the “mad movement” loosely unifying current and former patients from both groups, critical practitioners and academics, lawyers, artists, and others defending the rights of those labelled as mad.</p>
<p>Shimrat and I developed an enduring friendship, and I witnessed how she twice went more than a decade living independently and without any mental health system involvement. Yet in between, shortly after the deaths of people close to her, she behaved in distraught, strange ways that worried or annoyed neighbours and got psychiatrically incarcerated more than a dozen times.</p>
<p>“Here I was this privileged kid with a nice family. Middle class. A good student,” said Shimrat of her first experience of civil commitment at age twenty. Several significant disappointments coincided in her life and she wasn’t sleeping much. She’d always had a quirky personality and rich fantasy life, and after taking the psychedelic LSD one night, she didn’t come down. Over the ensuing weeks, she believed she could control traffic lights, others could read her mind, and she was communing with alien beings. Most of it felt fascinating and enjoyable, Shimrat said, but her worried father took her to a doctor. “All of a sudden, I’m incarcerated and being tortured. It was an appalling shock.”</p>
<p>Promptly labelled with schizophrenia, Shimrat more than once screamed and fought back as groups of men stripped her, restrained her in a gurney, and forcibly injected her. What had she done to deserve this, she asked herself. Had some wacky thoughts and said some wacky things? “I was fully cognizant of the injustice of it right away. The experience of being locked up and then debilitated with antipsychotics is brutal.”</p>
<p>She acknowledged that while some people could eventually find a tolerable dose that quelled their minds but left them still functional, for others&mdash;especially when not allowed to participate in dosage decisions&mdash;antipsychotics can be disabling. “The whole time that I was ever on antipsychotics, I sort of fluctuated between wanting to die and thinking that I had died and gone to hell,” Shimrat said. “All colour was drained from the world, like everything was grey, and I couldn’t remember where I was from moment to moment. There was just a sort of sense of grinding, endless tedium and pain, physical pain as well as the pain of not being able to think.”</p>
<p>One reason that opinions on involuntary treatment are so polarized, said Shimrat, traces directly to these most obvious effects of antipsychotic tranquilizers, by far the most common class of psychotropics forced on patients. If a person in crisis has been behaving fearfully or disruptively, the instantaneous numbing of emotion and slowing of thought and behaviour can sometimes seem like relief to the person and even more so to others in the person’s life. But for many, antipsychotics feel like a “chemical straitjacket.”</p>
<p>Her experiences in psychiatric hospitals have been “infinitely worse than even the worst moments” of her “so-called mental illness,” Shimrat said. “I’ll never recover completely from the trauma of it.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smallcaps">ver the years,</span> especially after I began freelancing in 2014 for science journalist Robert Whitaker’s web magazine, <em><a href="https://www.madinamerica.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mad in America</a></em>, I connected with hundreds of people who’d experienced civil commitment in the US and Canada&mdash;and gathered perspectives from thousands more via groups, organizations, research papers, and public events. Similar stories kept emerging: frightening police interventions, prison-like stripping under guard, meetings with psychiatrists that lasted only minutes before diagnoses were rendered, uncommunicative staff, heavy tranquilization, seclusion, four-point restraints, resignation to days languishing in bleak wards, unexpectedly long detentions and abrupt discharges, and enduring impacts of fear and trauma more than of healing. And while pro-force psychiatrists, governments, or organizations frequently suggested, without providing evidence, that I was only hearing about “unusual” cases unrepresentative of most people’s experiences, I noticed that, whenever I was able to review sources’ medical records, the treating psychiatrists themselves rarely characterized such cases<br />
as anything but typical.</p>
<p>Very occasionally, I found people who were glad they were detained. But when I delved into their stories, it seemed they’d usually experienced something entirely different. Medical staff had talked with them respectfully. They liked the effects of the drugs. They rapidly developed collaborative relationships with their treatment providers. They weren’t forcibly treated for long, if they ever really had been at all. I never came across anyone who’d exhibited real resistance to treatments and had no criticisms about what happened next.</p>
<p>There’s a clichéd caricaturization of involuntary patients as chronically insane, dangerous madmen, utterly divorced from reality. But the vast majority of the people I was encountering had gone through long periods of their lives&mdash;before and after their incarcerations&mdash;when they’d shopped for groceries; gone to school or held jobs; developed relationships; walked in nature; experienced hope, ambition, boredom, and love; created art; and basically done most things ordinary people do. Their crises and altered states of mood or consciousness usually emerged amid various combinations of sudden tragedies, major life transitions, escalating anxieties, loss of sleep, homelessness, poor eating, job losses, financial stresses, conflicts with family, and misuse of recreational or prescription substances&mdash;basically, circumstances that could potentially drive anyone “over the edge.” Most got hospitalized as a result of behaviours that simply confused, frightened, or annoyed others and had rarely engaged in violence or law breaking any worse than disturbing the peace or appearing threatening. Some agreed that their disruptiveness at the time merited being briefly apprehended&mdash;but why, they asked, were they also subjected, against their will, to invasive medical interventions in their brains?</p>
<p>Certainly, some people I spoke with had more difficulties expressing themselves or more enduring inner challenges&mdash;sometimes linked to childhood abuse, addictions, or intellectual disabilities&mdash;that had led to repeated hospitalizations. But these people tended to describe the impacts of restraints, seclusion, and forced drugging as even more disorienting, humiliating, and frightening.</p>
<p>And virtually everyone spoke of voicelessness. No matter what people’s backgrounds were or how their crises unfolded, they were devastated to suddenly be trapped in a hospital, being treated as if everything they’d been going through and all of their perspectives and wishes were now nothing more than “sickness” that needed to be immediately shut down&mdash;by force if necessary. After release, they’d still find the gag hard to remove. Studies have repeatedly found that most mental illness–related stories in news media are about dangerousness and violence, while less than 10 to 20 percent ever quote people labelled with mental disorders, let alone people who’ve been forcibly treated.</p>
<p>This particular kind of stifling oppression stayed with Shimrat forever after. Now sixty-three, a long-lasting effect of forced hospitalizations, she told me, was a crushing of her creative soul: “[Involuntary treatment] left me unable to write fiction, which I had previously done easily. The kind of self-doubt that comes from being punished for imagining things devastates your imagination.”</p>
<p>Shimrat ultimately found some degree of healing and creative revitalization through writing about her experiences and helping create platforms for others. “Forced psychiatry is oppression and silencing,” she said. “If you give voice to people who have been silenced and oppressed and forced to suppress their emotions, they find out that they’re not alone. That can be the beginning of reemerging.”</p>
<p>For two decades, the overriding message from the mental health system has been that a drastic shortage of beds, along with strict civil rights–protecting laws, has made it nearly impossible to hospitalize and involuntarily treat anyone&mdash;even the “sickest and most dangerous” often can’t be detained.</p>
<p>For example, in a <em><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/untreated-mental-illness-an-imminent-danger/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">60 Minutes</em> episode in 2013</a>, prominent pro-force psychiatrist and author E. Fuller Torrey talked about how few hospital beds there were and was asked, “How difficult is it to get somebody admitted who does not want to be admitted?” Torrey answered, “Almost impossible in most states. The laws will read, ‘You have to be a danger to yourself or others,’ in some states, and judges may interpret this very, very strictly. You know, we kiddingly say, ‘You have to be either trying to kill your psychiatrist or trying to kill yourself in front of your psychiatrist to be able to get hospitalized.’” </p>
<p>But this didn’t square with what I as a journalist was seeing on the ground in communities: relatively ordinary distresses or disruptive activities getting people forced into hospitals from schools, seniors’ facilities, workplaces, subsidized housing, and so on.</p>
<p>It also did not square with the actual numbers&mdash;I was investigating those too.</p>
<p>After many of North America’s long-term asylums closed, most civil psychiatric detentions lasted for days, weeks, or months rather than years, so before-and-after comparisons with respect to the 1980s are challenging. Today, good statistics are hard to come by&mdash;federal, state, and provincial governments don’t gather them, don’t gather them in full, or don’t share them publicly. Nevertheless, everywhere decent statistics can be found, they show that Americans and Canadians are being forcibly detained at per capita rates that have been rising steadily and dramatically since the 1990s.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n Alberta,</span> between 2008 and 2017, the per capita rate of psychiatric detentions more than doubled. From 2005 to 2016, British Columbia’s population grew by only 6 percent, but its number of involuntary patients doubled annually, to nearly 20,000. Similarly, in Ontario, between 2008 and 2018, the population grew by 10 percent, while the number of involuntary psychiatric hospital patients nearly doubled annually, to 46,000. In some provinces, about half to 75 percent of adult psychiatric hospital patients were involuntary, and overall, it appeared that more than 150,000 Canadians were being detained every year. Most stays were for periods of ten to thirty days at a time&mdash;and, apparently, about three to fourteen days in the US.</p>
<p>In Florida, from 2001 to 2016, the number of detainees doubled to nearly 200,000&mdash;outstripping population growth by a factor of five. In California, the per capita rates of psychiatric detentions for three-day periods increased about 30 percent annually between 1991 and 2016, surpassing 150,000. In that same time frame, California’s population-adjusted number of thirty-day detentions nearly tripled, and that of child detainees more than doubled. It later became apparent that these numbers were incomplete, and in some large California counties, the rates were now multiple times higher than was being officially reported to the state. In Colorado, emergency psychiatric detentions nearly doubled to 39,000 from 2011 to 2016.</p>
<p>Rudimentary “one-day estimates,” gathered by the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration from facility administrators, reported that 34 percent of people in all psychiatric or general hospitals for mental health reasons were detained under civil commitment laws. (Another 19 percent&mdash;most in large state hospitals&mdash;were involuntary patients under criminal charges, detained in the forensic psychiatric system on grounds of “not guilty by reason of insanity.”)</p>
<p>But even those numbers didn’t tell the whole story. Many experts suggested that, in both countries, potentially 80 to 90 percent or more of psychiatric hospital patients may be there unwillingly. In part, this is because, if people actively seek help, ironically, they’re often refused services and sent home with drugs in hand, to keep beds for forcing people. But it’s also because the legal tool of civil commitment is not unlike a loaded gun&mdash;it’s often enough to just wave around the threat while promising that following the doctor’s orders could lead to freedom sooner. Many people I spoke with said they’d indeed been unwilling “voluntary” patients.</p>
<p>The facts about civil commitments are so heavily cloaked from public view, though, it took me much searching and many freedom of information requests just to gather this much reliable data. However, in 2020, Gi Lee, a PhD student at the University of California–Los Angeles, and David Cohen, a social welfare professor, research scholar on psychotropic drug efficacy, and long-time critic of “overmedicalizing” emotional distress, published the results of their own five-year quest, in <em><a href="https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ps.201900477" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Psychiatric Services</a></em>.</p>
<p>Like me, Lee and Cohen found hodgepodges of data with many glaring holes. But in the twenty-four states where they found data, at least 600,000 detentions occurred under mental health laws in 2014&mdash;by extrapolation, 1.2 million nationally. In some states, like Nevada and Indiana, the rates had nearly doubled in eight years. In twenty-two states with continuous data between 2012 and 2016, psychiatric detentions had increased every single year and, on the whole, three times faster than the population growth.</p>
<p>And these weren’t just the same patients getting re-hospitalized many times. As I had, Cohen also found that wherever those numbers could be separated out, repeat hospitalizations comprised just 5 to 20 percent, and most of those were only twice.</p>
<p>All told, at more than 300 adults per 100,000, the rates of psychiatric detention in the US and Canada appeared to be more than double and triple the rates in the UK, Sweden, Finland, Germany, France, and most other European countries with comparable mental health systems.</p>
<p>In an accompanying commentary in <em>Psychiatric Services</em>, psychiatrists from several universities pointed to the dangers. “[I]n the absence of consistent data,” they wrote, the public has “no assurance” that these forced psychiatric interventions are being implemented in just and responsible ways. And, they added, psychiatrists cannot answer the “fundamental question” of whether these forced interventions are actually, on the whole, helping people.</p>
<p>“The concern,” Cohen told me in conversation, “is that we’re probably doing exactly what we were doing sixty years ago. My concern is the mental health system is just as coercive as it’s always been&mdash;and possibly more.”</p>
<p>Cohen said he had many reasons to doubt the completeness of his numbers, and he suspected that, today, closer to 1.5 million Americans get psychiatrically detained each year&mdash;plus large numbers of voluntary patients feeling under threat. I noticed, though, that the numbers tended to be higher wherever the data seemed more detailed and reliable. When I averaged the data for several of those states, the number of Americans getting psychiatrically detained projected closer to 2.3 million annually. Either way, although for comparatively shorter stays, it would appear to be many times the number of people detained at the 1950s’ peak of massive psychiatric asylums.</p>
<p>And even these numbers likely enormously understate the extent of psychiatric coercion going on in our society.</p>
<p>The apparent wide variances in rates between states&mdash;up to thirty-three-fold&mdash;also raised questions for Cohen. “Why is it that there’s such a difference? Is one of those states doing something right or doing something wrong?” And without decent data, Cohen asked, how can we answer the most important question: “What happens to people who get committed?”</p>
<p>He was frustrated by so many data black holes. We discussed Colorado and Ontario, where governments were collecting good data but, in recent years, without explanation, made the statistics much less accessible. As the <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> pandemic and lockdowns set in, some hospitals seemingly temporarily emptied, while others became death traps&mdash;overall, statistics became still more difficult to unearth. I asked Cohen if he believed, in this era of electronic records, the many data holes were intentional. He replied, “Overall, there’s little information available; it’s part of the functioning of the system. In that sense, it’s deliberate. But is it a conscious effort?”</p>
<p>Most governments and treatment providers, Cohen argued, don’t want to publicly expose “the dark heart” of our mental health system&mdash;that a core function is to incarcerate and control masses of people. “There’s nothing pleasant about that. There’s nothing beautiful and pretty. It’s just exclusion: ‘Please take them away from me.’ And because we’re saying we’re doing it to help them, there’s a kind of systemic dissonance.”</p>
<p>Did he suspect that civil commitment powers were being used on a growing diversity of people in an expanding array of circumstances?</p>
<p>“Yes, I think we’re going too far,” said Cohen. “But I wish we had more information to be able to say that. I don’t really know who they are.”</p>

<p>The reporter stops a middle-aged man exuding dad rock energy on his way to buying an assortment of tall boys and asks how much he drinks each day. “Well, what day,” he shrugs. “On a regular day, I dunno, maybe a couple beers.

<p>Much of society, both ancient and modern, has revolved around <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/alcohol/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">alcohol</a>. One of the oldest known laws, dating back to circa 1770 BCE, during the Babylonian Empire, contains regulations for taverns (including a punishment of death by drowning for bartenders who served their customers smaller-than-advertised pours of beer), while ancient Greek and Roman literature details the copious amounts of wine consumed by gods and commoners alike. Stanford archaeologists have theorized that it was a thirst for beer&mdash;not a hunger for bread&mdash;that propelled the development of agriculture, which many consider to be the foundation of civilization itself. Today, in North America, turning the legal drinking age&mdash;and the blurry night that accompanies it&mdash;is seen as a rite of passage. Holidays, births, marriages, and celebrations of all kinds are marked by glasses filled with champagne, beer, or Scotch, as are our mundane rituals: a stressful workday, a sunny afternoon, or a date. So while it’s easy to recommend that we reconsider our relationship with alcohol, actually getting people to change their habits&mdash;especially ones that are so deeply ingrained&mdash;may prove to be a much slower process. </p>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smallcaps">hether it’s feasible</span> or not to cut back on booze, the reasons for doing so aren’t entirely unconvincing. The old guidelines for safe consumption, released in 2011, were based on outdated research, some of which went as far as to claim that drinking in moderation offered <em>protection</em> against certain cardiovascular diseases. (For proof, look no further than the French, who drink wine in abundance yet tend to live longer than the average North American, according to commonly cited and now debunked research from the ’80s.) But over the past decade, evidence of an alternative narrative has emerged. </p>
<p>Alcohol is a known carcinogen. When you drink a pint of beer or a glass of whisky, your liver converts the alcohol into a toxic chemical called acetaldehyde, then breaks that down into a less toxic compound called acetate. The entire process of trying to rid your system of an evening’s libations sends your body’s functions into overdrive&mdash;which is why it isn’t unusual to wake up the next day feeling like a groggy, hollow version of your former self. While the short-term misery that accompanies a hangover does subside, a buildup of acetaldehyde in the body can lead to DNA damage, and since DNA contains the instruction manual for normal cell function, any changes to it can prevent your body from being able to repair itself, putting you at a greater risk of cancer, stroke, and a handful of other diseases. It’s like trying to put together an Ikea wardrobe without all of the illustrations: you could wing it, but a few forgotten screws may one day cause the whole thing to collapse.  </p>
<p>According to the new guidelines, those who consume between three and six standard drinks a week expose themselves to a 1 in 100 chance of premature death, with an increasingly higher risk level for those who consume more than six per week. That may not seem high, but compared to risk thresholds for other voluntary activities like smoking, where the risk is 1 in 1,000, drinking can be significantly more dangerous. </p>
<p>“The higher threshold that has been historically accepted and used for alcohol comes from the cultural, social, and economic attachment that we have to it as a Western culture,” says Peter Butt, an associate professor in the University of Saskatchewan’s department of family medicine who worked on the new guidelines. “We’ve developed this mythology around it, where all of these things are seen as beneficial&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;but we’ve overlooked the health impacts.”</p>
<p>To draw their conclusions, the researchers who worked on the new recommendations reviewed just under 6,000 studies on the health effects of alcohol, eventually selecting sixteen deemed to be the most eligible based on the project’s research questions and needs for mathematical modelling. And while the methodology, at least from a scientific perspective, seems sound, the guidelines’ critics aren’t limited to distraught Beer Store goers. One of the most vocal skeptics is Dan Malleck, a professor in the Department of Health Sciences at Brock University who studies drug and alcohol regulation and policy. In an op-ed for the <em>Globe and Mail</em>, he <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-canadas-drastic-new-alcohol-guidelines-demand-a-closer-look/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">argued</a> that the report examined drinking through a purely medical lens, failing to account for the positive effects drinking can have on a person’s life. What about its ability to help us relax? Or to bring a group of people together? Research shows that such positive effects can improve long-term health outcomes too. </p>
<p>During our conversation, Butt is quick to emphasize that the point of the guidelines is harm reduction, not abstinence. “Canadians didn’t want to be told what to do. They want to have all the information so that they can make decisions for themselves,” he says. “This isn’t about prohibition; this is about drinking less.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">t first glance,</span> Hekate in New York City’s East Village looks like most other casual bars. Popular drinks are spelled out on the wall in chalk: a spring spritz, a jalapeno margarita, a small selection of craft beers. A group of friends clink glasses; a couple on a first date share sips of cocktails, passing their drinks back and forth; tourists wander in off the street, looking to take a seat after a long day of sightseeing. But despite the collection of colourful bottles and cans displayed at the bar, nothing here contains any alcohol.    </p>
<p>Its owner, Abby Ehmann&mdash;who’s lived in New York for nearly four decades&mdash;opened Hekate’s doors in 2022. A bar owner since 2016, she had been toying with the idea of starting a second business for a few years when she found a vacant storefront directly across the street from her bar Lucky (which does serve alcohol). </p>
<p>Lucky has its fair share of regulars, but that came with its own set of problems. “My number one customer had a stroke, and his doctor told him, ‘Maybe you shouldn’t be drinking so much,’” Ehmann says. “I had created a place that people wanted to come to every night, but that also resulted in them drinking every night. So I thought, ‘How can I create the same sort of ambiance and community but without alcohol?’”</p>
<p>While January is a notoriously slow month for hospitality, Ehmann says business at Hekate was “off the charts”&mdash;so much so that she ran out of some of the non-alcoholic spirits. Her bar is one of the few fully alcohol-free ones in New York, but it’s part of a small wave of similar establishments that have popped up in Dublin, Melbourne, Austin, and Toronto. Non-alcoholic beer, wine, and spirit sales in the US still make up only a tiny fraction of the market of alcohol sales (less than 1 percent), but these drinks are growing in popularity. <a href="https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/education/2022/non-alcoholic-beverage-trends-in-the-us/#:~:text=Non%2Dalcoholic%20beverage%20sales%20are,year%20growth%20of%20%2B20.6%25" rel="noopener" target="_blank">According to data</a> from NielsenIQ, between 2021 and 2022, sales of non-alcoholic wine increased 23.2 percent, while those of non-alcoholic spirits increased 88.4 percent&mdash;which might help explain why it’s becoming far more common to see mocktails or low-alcohol cocktails listed on standard-fare bar menus. There’s also something to be said about the quality of the products available today. About a decade ago, boozeless options were mostly limited to juices and sodas. Now, there are easily sourced artisanal alternatives for every vice&mdash;be it gin, bourbon, or rum&mdash;and they offer flavour profiles similar to those of their alcoholic counterparts. </p>
<p>Drinking has already been on the decline&mdash;albeit slowly&mdash;for decades. A <a href="https://nphic.org/blog/738-millennials-and-gen-zers-embrace-life-can-take-you-higher-than-alcohol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2018 survey</a> by Berenberg Research found that respondents in their teens and early twenties were drinking 20 percent less than millennials did at that same age. Other research has found that millennials also drink less than Gen Xers and boomers. Currently, 22 percent of people in Canada don’t drink at all, while just over 20 percent consider themselves to be light drinkers, consuming less than three standard alcoholic beverages per week. That means more than half the population is drinking at a level that would place them in the moderate- or high-risk categories of the new guidelines. </p>
<p>And it’s not only that younger generations are drinking less. Some aren’t drinking at all. A 2019 study in England found that about a quarter of sixteen-to-twenty-four-year-olds were totally sober. Even among those who haven’t given up booze, the practice of “mindful drinking,” or developing a healthier relationship with alcohol, is becoming far more common. The reasons for this vary, but <a href="//www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220920-why-gen-zers-are-growing-up-sober-curious" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to one BBC article</a>, it could be because the way young people relax is changing too. Gen Z has been dubbed the “always on” generation. Their unavoidable tether to smartphones means they tend to be more prone to switching off in their spare time than going out and getting wasted (though other research suggests they’re more likely to gravitate toward cannabis and magic mushrooms). </p>
<p>“In the mid to late 2000s, getting drunk and binge drinking was a way friendships were formed and solidified&mdash;even experiencing the negative effects together was a key part of making and sustaining friends in adolescence and early adulthood,” John Holmes, professor of alcohol policy at the University of Sheffield, told the BBC. “But Gen Zers are more likely to see drunkenness as unpleasant, uncool, or uninteresting.”</p>
<p>The shift in attitude isn’t entirely dissimilar to how most millennials interact with cigarettes. Once considered to be cool (not to mention cheap), many governments were able to change the public image of tobacco consumption by introducing educational campaigns, tightening controls around sales, and limiting smoke-friendly spaces. Should they try to do the same with alcohol too? </p>
<p>According to Edward Slingerland, a philosophy professor at the University of British Columbia and the author of <em>Drunk: How We Sipped, Danced, and Stumbled Our Way to Civilization</em>, the answer is a bit more nuanced. While Slingerland, himself a lover of negronis, acknowledges that alcohol can be a dangerous substance, he, like Malleck, says that the new recommendations don’t account for the creative and hedonistic benefits that a few drinks here and there can provide. In <em>Drunk</em>, he argues that throughout the entirety of history, alcohol has been used as a social lubricant, enabling everything from creativity to peacekeeping.  </p>
<p>“Around the world, whenever you have potentially hostile people who need to come to an agreement, or just strangers who need to get along, alcohol comes out,” he says. “It helps with social bonding and getting people past mutual distrust or awkwardness&mdash;which humans need because we have a lot of primate instincts.” </p>
<p>Unlike nicotine, which can be more easily replaced by things like coffee, there’s no readily available substitute that offers the same functional effects as booze. Because alcohol is a depressant, having a glass of wine or two can slow down processes in our central nervous system, making us feel more at ease (at least temporarily). Something like cannabis, on the other hand, is harder to dose and affects everyone differently. “Imagine going on a date to a bar where we’re smoking pot and you get really happy and want to talk about philosophy while I get paranoid and then fall asleep at the table,” says Slingerland. “There’s probably not going to be a second date.” </p>
<p>Slingerland adds that, historically, alcohol consumption has always been regulated, albeit informally. At ancient Greek symposiums, guests weren’t allowed to drink until the host passed the wine around the table. Similarly, attendees of banquets in traditional China had to wait until a toast was made before they could start sipping. Even today, those who drink at bars with friends tend to order in rounds to maintain a pace with each other. In every scenario, alcohol was meant to be enjoyed in the company of others&mdash;not for the purpose of getting sloshed alone. </p>
<p>But having private access to liquor at home&mdash;especially at the peak of the pandemic, when excessive drinking increased by 21 percent, according to one study from the Massachusetts General Hospital, which used data from a national survey of American adults about their drinking habits&mdash;makes regulation much more difficult. “Now, I can call up the local liquor store and have them deliver a case of tequila to my house,” says Slingerland. “Then I can drink as much of it as I want without anyone stopping me. That’s when it becomes harder to control our consumption.”</p>
<p>It’s clear that some of the more recent rituals we’ve developed around drinking haven’t been for the better, but Slingerland is optimistic that we can change that trajectory. “We have a sense that alcohol is more dangerous than it used to be&mdash;and that maybe we’re not drinking healthily. But humans are very clever, and we’re good at coming up with new ways to try to get a handle on things.” Perhaps that’s where the real change needs to occur: how we drink, how often we drink, in what quantities, and the accompanying social circumstances that steer how we imbibe. The way we drink has evolved over centuries. Maybe it’s time to embrace the next evolution. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/how-bad-is-alcohol/">How Bad Is Alcohol, Really?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

Give me a large book and a horizontal position, and I could fall asleep strapped to the top of a bullet train. Sleep has been a constant ally, a friend. When I was a teen, it was a refuge. I used to pray for sleep; its temporary oblivion was a welcome respite from anxiety and obsessive thoughts. It was a pause, not a death but close enough to it. Every time I fell asleep, there was a chance of resurrection, to wake up new.</p>
<p>My girlfriend, Allison, however, does not think I’m a good sleeper. She knows the truth. At night, I’m thrashing around and screaming. Occasionally, it sounds like my breathing stops. Worst of all for her, I snore. Badly. She’s shown me a video of it, and it’s horrifying: my thin, wheezing inhales are interrupted by a wrenching tear of a noise. It sounds like someone ripping a carpet in half inside a cave. It sounds like a Hans Zimmer score. It’s awful.</p>
<p>We sometimes get into these little fights when I wake up. She’s had a terrible sleep and is justifiably pissed. She can’t stay mad for long, though, because who is she mad at? It wasn’t me snoring, not really. Certainly, it was my body, my lungs, my soft tissues getting flabbier with age and drinking. Those are the guilty parties. But I wasn’t even there. Ask anybody. </p>
<p>When my girlfriend is flipping my sleeping body over and plugging its nose, or occasionally smothering my face with a pillow or two, who is she smothering? How unimportant is the self to our life when we are sleeping&mdash;something we spend a third of our life doing; something that if we didn’t do, we would die&mdash;that it can be completely absent?</p>

</ul>
<p>I tried treating my snoring with the junk-drawer solution of purchasing every anti-snoring device available at Shoppers Drug Mart. Nose strips, mouth guards, some kind of nasal spray&mdash;anything that the store had on sale on those two shelves promising snoring absolution between the Ricolas and the orthotics. Nothing worked. Every time, there would be a slight glimmer of hope, a placebo-infused sleep where we would try to convince ourselves my snoring was better. But, every time, it soon became clear the only difference was that the top of my mouth was now shredded from the cheap plastic of the so-called snore guard. </p>
<p>Allison wanted me to see a doctor about the snoring, but it’s hard to take snoring seriously as a <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/category/society/health/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">health</a> problem. It seems more like a joke, like a health problem that a sitcom dad would have after getting electrocuted by Christmas decorations. It doesn’t seem like a health issue but more like a personality defect. </p>
<p>According to Nick van den Berg, a PhD candidate in experimental psychology at the University of Ottawa and a member of the <a href="https://css-scs.ca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Canadian Sleep Society</a>, “Snoring occurs as our muscles in the upper airway relax so much that they narrow the airway.” This is why snoring gets worse as we get older, as our once taut and virile inner neck muscles become flabby and weak with age. The real threat of bad snoring is it could be a sign you have obstructive sleep apnea&mdash;which is when your airway is completely blocked. This blockage causes you to wake up constantly. The lack of sleep&mdash;for you or your partner&mdash;caused by snoring can be a serious health risk, as insufficient sleep has been linked to cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p>More than the health issues, a lack of sleep can cause almost existential issues. Sleep is essential to your functioning as a human being. “Sleep is key to memory consolidation,” van den Berg told me. It is not entirely clear how, but when we are asleep, our brain organizes, processes, and saves our memory. More than that, he added, “Sleep doesn’t just stabilize our memories but also enhances our memories.” He told me about studies where the subjects are taught a basic skill before bed, and when they wake up, not only do they remember the skill but have actually improved upon it. Sleep, then, is more than necessary; it’s where we are forged. Every night, we throw our day-to-day experiences, memories, and lessons into the kiln of sleep, let them bake for hopefully eight hours, and remove a better, stronger, fuller version of ourselves in the morning.</p>
<p>So my girlfriend was right to insist I deal with the problem, but I was resistant. I’m in my mid-thirties, I haven’t had a doctor since I was a kid. My health care subsisted on walk-in clinic visits and youthful hubris&mdash;a faith that things will work out and a belief that a problem doesn’t really exist until you deal with it. But I think what really scared me off was that going to a doctor about my snoring would be my first confrontation with the way I live and its repercussions, almost like being shown a mirror to my mortality. Certainly not a face to face with the Grim Reaper, seeing who would blink first, but definitely footsies: the first acknowledgement that I’m not impervious to the effects of time and decisions made, that my body has limits, that it can break and fall apart, and that, to live a good life, one has to make good decisions. And as someone who thoroughly enjoys bad decisions, that’s an unpleasant pill to swallow. </p>
<p>It has been a tough year. A friend passed away suddenly and tragically. Then my grandmother followed. A chronic knee problem I had turned into a full-blown meniscus tear, dashing any hopes of a late-life bloom in a guy who is “surprisingly athletic” and revealing a body that is eroding with time. My eyesight became distorted. A visit to the eye doctor revealed I had fluid under my retina, a condition called central serous chorioretinopathy. It’s caused by stress. I started seeing a therapist again. Within minutes, over Zoom, he told me I looked depressed. Things felt harder, time less plentiful. I was reminded that there’s no guarantee that things will just work out. It was a year of the space capsule of my youthful fantasy breaking up on contact with an atmosphere of reality and repercussions, all soundtracked by some of the worst snoring you’ve ever heard.</p>
<p>But there are other things to be afraid of besides <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/aging/">aging</a>, and fearing a breakup or an unexplained disappearance, I tried what Allison had been asking me to do. I went to a doctor. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he doctor</span> asked me how much I drank a week. I gave him a number that was high enough for me to know he should factor it in his diagnosis but low enough that I could say it out loud without being embarrassed. He figured I had sleep apnea and said I should drink less and lose weight. He referred me to a sleep study to confirm the diagnosis. To get a CPAP machine for the apnea, I’d need the study results. A CPAP machine is a device that shoots a steady flow of pressurized oxygen into your nose and mouth. It involves a hose, a mask that covers either your nose or mouth or both, and a head harness, resulting in the wearer looking like a cozy fighter plane pilot, like <em>Top Gun</em>’s Maverick if the undisclosed enemy country were your dreams. </p>
<p>The sleep clinic was in Toronto’s St. Joseph’s Health Centre. I entered the hospital ready to get my sleep on. I felt nervous and excited and blisteringly sober. I had successfully adhered to the guidelines sent out by the clinic: no alcohol in the past twelve hours, no coffee in the last two, and no naps. My mind was unadorned&mdash;free from its usual coating of hangover shame, too-late coffee worry, and post-nap delirium&mdash;and hungry for some answers and clarity.  </p>
<p>Next, a technician saw me and asked a couple of questions, the most provocative being: What position do you sleep in? I’m mostly a mix of side and stomach, with one leg pitched like I’m doing a hurdle. Overall, though, I would describe my sleeping position as maximum obnoxious. My limbs are splayed as far as they can reach, and I am continually thrashing and rolling from side to side in erratic and irregular movements. Basically, I sleep like David Byrne dances.</p>
<p>I sat on my assigned bed, waiting for the sleep lab to begin its work. “Lab” was really a strong word for the experience. There were no beakers, or mad scientists, or stainless-steel tanks with anonymous figures floating in green fluid. There was just a generic hospital room: infinite white walls; a thin, hard bed that felt like I was lying on an H&#038;M clothing shelf; a clunky, foreboding radiator; and a pillow that had all the comfort and support of a bag of napkins. Worst of all, there was an AC unit that something was dripping onto, producing a sharp, arrhythmic, metallic smack.</p>
<p>At quarter to eleven, the technician came in. He was disappointingly less of a mad scientist than I was expecting. Instead, he seemed sleep deprived and grumpy. He began sticking the sensors to my body for the electroencephalogram, or EEG. Created in 1924, this test uses electrodes to measure your brain waves without being invasive (cutting your head open). It is still the gold standard for sleep studies. Sensors were also placed on my arms and legs to measure my movement, and a sensor was placed below my nose and a harness around my chest to measure my breathing. I don’t know what it says about my self-esteem, but I found being a specimen thrilling. The thrill quickly passed as I proceeded to have the worst sleep of my life. </p>
<p>Ideally, there are two types of sleep that can be divided into four stages. The first three stages are of NREM, or non-rapid eye movement, sleep. It is in these three stages that typical sleep occurs. Stage one is the drifting-off period: those fifteen minutes of drowsiness where it is hard to tell if you are asleep or not. Once you are out, the second stage begins. It is marked by slower brain waves and short, fast bursts of brain activity called spindles. Both are thought to be involved in memory consolidation. The third stage of NREM is slow-wave sleep. Your brain waves are now deep, long curves, similar, at times, to those seen in people under anaesthesia. It is in these last two stages of sleep that the majority of restoration happens.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the second act of sleep occurs: REM sleep. The brain explodes with activity; it appears awake. This is when most dreaming occurs, especially the intense, emotional genre of dreams&mdash;the ones that are like “I’m on a date with a book report I didn’t finish” or “I started playing hockey again, but I didn’t realize that my skates are made of everyone I’ve ever disappointed.” Your body reacts accordingly. Beneath the eyelids, your eyes start to dart around wildly, and your heart races. If your body weren’t paralyzed, your limbs would be thrashing around. It’s not entirely clear why this happens. Van den Berg’s favourite theory is that it is preparatory. “If NREM is recovery from the day before, REM seems to be preparation for the day ahead.” This would explain why some dreams can be so intense: they are training modules for the most heightened emotions you can experience.</p>
<p>When you have a good night’s sleep, these different acts and stages are a harmonious cycle. Of course, many things can disrupt this harmony: electric light, caffeine, a long night out, or&mdash;as I found out&mdash;being covered in wires that precariously cling to your body with every toss and turn. Many thoughts can keep you up at night, and in the lab, I discovered a new one: “I sure hope that when I turned over, I didn’t ruin this experiment being performed on me.” Another pressure point in the delicate dance of the sleep stages is if there is an unceasing arrhythmic drip onto an air conditioning unit the entire night and the drip sounds like someone didn’t turn off the tap in your brain&mdash;a drip that erodes who you are, who you were, and who you would be into a howling nothingness begging for sweet release. </p>
<p>I was woken up at five-thirty after maybe two hours of gruel-thin snoozing. The wires were removed, and I strolled home in the dawn light, feeling like my sleep–wake cycle and circadian rhythms were utterly and completely ruined. I didn’t know what kind of information they could glean from my dire snooze, but I learned that there were limits to my sleeping abilities, and one of them was getting the Weapon X treatment.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">fter two months</span>, the results of the study came in. There was no sleep apnea. I have what the report called “mild primary snoring.” As far as the study could tell, there is no particular reason for it. Aging, drinking too much, and rapidly deteriorating neck muscles are all it takes. The snoring wasn’t a condition; it was the sound of time catching up to me.</p>
<p>These were not the results I was looking for. I had been hoping for a condition, a disorder, another of life’s petty aggrievements I could list and point to whenever I indulged in a self-pity wallow. I wanted a quick fix even if that quick fix was strapping a glorified bike pump to my face. Instead, what I got was consequences. I used to not believe in consequences. Not really. I thought I could do what I wanted. Any suffering that came along was something I didn’t have control over; it was something to get used to, like the weather. The responsibility you have to yourself and others eluded me. But decisions have consequences, and they aren’t a one-time deal. Instead, they coalesce and compound and reverberate, like a snore off the inner walls of your throat. There is no guarantee things will just work out: injuries worsen, tragedy happens, your girlfriend gets fed up with you snoring. When you don’t sleep, you don’t just get it back by sleeping in the next day. It takes days for you to recover.</p>
<p>My snoring has gotten worse since the study. Louder, more frequent. Thankfully, my girlfriend and I have figured out a staggered sleep schedule that seems to work. More than that, I’d like to think I’m trying. I’m working out more, eating slightly better, drinking less. From this study, I learned you are not just your moment-to-moment thoughts and feelings. You are an accumulation of everything you did before. The person you are today builds from the person you were the day before: when you ate, what you learned, how you slept. You have to take care of yourself and others. Things aren’t just going to get better on their own.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/stop-snoring/">How I Tried to Stop Snoring, Fix My Sleep Habits, and Confront My Mortality</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

Just last year, a tortoise named Jonathan, who holds the Guinness World Record for being the oldest ever chelonian, turned 190 years old.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</sup></a> We asked Rita da Silva, a conservation demographer who conducted a study at the University of Southern Denmark on aging rates in turtles, what secrets these shelled seniors hold to living a long life.</p>
<p><strong>How do turtles and tortoises age differently from humans?</strong> </p>
<p>We know that as humans get older, their bone density, mobility, and flexibility decrease, and the probability of dying increases. In the turtle populations I’ve studied&mdash;especially the ones that live in captivity&mdash;their mortality rate can actually decrease with age. Some researchers have even hypothesized that turtles and tortoises could live forever if they managed to avoid predators and disease.</p>
<p><strong>What makes that possible?</strong> </p>
<p>There’s a theory that links anti-aging in certain species to their ability to continue growing their entire lives. That includes turtles, most fish, and plants. The same mechanism that allows them to grow also allows them to restore cells throughout their bodies. It has been hypothesized that for this reason, they can avoid aging and possibly even contracting age-related diseases. Humans, however, stop allocating energy to growing, and our cells become damaged over time, making us more susceptible to illnesses such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>How much does our environment affect how long we live? </strong></p>
<p>In one study I worked on, we compared three species of turtle populations in captivity to ones in the wild. We found that the mortality rate does not increase with age for the captive populations, but it does for the wild populations. There are a few theories that might explain this. In captivity, turtles don’t have to spend energy avoiding predators. They don’t have to look for shelter or food, and the temperature is controlled. It’s a stable environment all around, and we suspect that these environmental conditions do play a role in how turtles age. Barring illness and injury, we don’t yet fully understand what eventually causes them to die.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, two of the researchers I worked with on this project published another study that compared aging rates between humans and other primates. One of their conclusions was that when it comes to our species, our environment isn’t as significant. Over the past century, our life expectancy has been increasing because we have better access to health care and lower infant mortality rates, but we haven’t been able to drastically improve the rate at which we age.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref1">2</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>So what are humans’ prospects for living longer?</strong></p>
<p>Some people hypothesize that we could, in theory, live forever if our conditions keep improving. Others think there’s a plateau&mdash;that no matter how good our conditions are, eventually, we will stop extending our life expectancy.</p>
<p>To determine which of these theories is true, researchers are also studying other species that are more closely related to humans, including other mammals and even birds.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref1">3</sup></a> I do believe that if we can figure out why some are better at delaying aging by avoiding the effects of diseases such as cancer, and what makes these species eventually die, we, too, might find new ways to protect ourselves from those diseases. </p>

<p>1. It’s been suggested that Jonathan could be closer to 200 years old, as there’s no written record of his birth.</p>
<p>2. Life expectancy in the US actually decreased by one year between 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-19, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>3. Bowhead whales, which can resist many age-related diseases, have one of the longest life expectancies of all mammals. In 2015, researchers sequenced the animal’s genome, which could eventually help them learn how to reverse the effects of human aging.<br />
