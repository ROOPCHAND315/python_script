In Quebec, <em>Le Devoir</em> reports on a press conference organized by tenant committees demanding provincial investment in affordable housing. A commentary published in a BC magazine argues that “we must have more homes and we must have them at prices people can afford to pay.”</p>
<p>For many readers, these stories sound like a random selection of the last week’s news. They could have been. The “housing crisis” is a recurring topic in Canadian media, with hardly a week going by where we do not hear new and daunting findings about how unaffordable <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/housing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">housing</a> has become. It is also a dominant theme in public policy circles, where “housing crisis” comes up regardless of the topic of discussion. Never mind the many podcasts, conferences, articles, and reports on the “housing crisis.” All of this fuss conceals the fact that political struggle over housing is old news. The <em>Toronto Star </em>article is from 1950, the<em> Maclean’s</em> story appeared in 1969, the Montreal press conference took place in 1980, and the BC commentary dates back to 1911. More importantly, the problem with all of this crisis talk is that there is no actual “housing crisis.” That’s right&mdash;there is no crisis.</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he word crisis</span> suggests something that is infrequent, surprising, and widely undesirable&mdash;something that leads to dire consequences unless it is brought under control. The United Nations defines a humanitarian crisis as “an event or series of events that represents a critical threat to the health, safety, security, or well-being of a community or other large group of people usually over a wider area.” Examples include pandemics, natural disasters, and war. An International Monetary Fund study defines a financial crisis as “an amalgam of events, including substantial changes in credit volume and asset prices, severe disruptions in financial intermediation, notably the supply of external financing, large-scale balance sheet problems, and the need for large-scale government support.” In fewer words: countries gone bankrupt.</p>
<p>It is fair to expect governments to act with resolve when dealing with real crises, swiftly deploying the personnel and resources needed to stop the bleeding. <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> was a health crisis, and governments did what they did to contain the spread of the virus. Financial crises like the 2008 economic meltdown are met with prompt and costly government measures. The Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted a speedy, large-scale response from several countries and international organizations.</p>
<p>In contrast, Canada’s “housing crisis” is a permanent state of affairs that harms people in, or in need of, rental housing: roughly one-third of the country’s households. The other two-thirds own homes whose values rise much faster than those of other investment options. New homeowners may face high housing costs, but mortgage payments are accompanied by long-term growth in their personal wealth. Landlords, <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/real-estate/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">real estate</a> investment firms, and developers operate in a stable and lucrative business environment. Even 2020&mdash;the first year of the pandemic when entire sectors of the economy were shut down&mdash;was a good year for the industry. Banks and other mortgage providers create money, lend it, and charge interest on it. If that wasn’t already a sweet deal, the federal government assumes a share of the risk of these mortgages so that banks can make easy money worry free.</p>
<p>A housing system that serves all but one group is not in a state of crisis; it is one based on structural inequality and economic exploitation. For some readers, “exploitation” may sound too harsh a term. Renting properties is not only legal but morally acceptable, and some people argue landlords help tenants by providing them with a place to live. In the political economy tradition, exploitation has a specific meaning: it refers to a group or class of people appropriating an unfair share of the fruits of the labour of another class. The classic example is workers and bosses.</p>
<p>The highest paid CEOs in Canada earn the equivalent of the annual income of average workers in just one morning. People need to work, and if the jobs available are low paying, they have no choice but to accept them. The wages these workers take home represent but a small portion of the total value of their work; executives and shareholders pocket most of that value. This is legal and widely accepted, which doesn’t mean it is not exploitation. On the contrary, it is exploitation because laws, institutions, and moral norms allow some people to enrich on the backs of others. Unless tightly regulated, labour markets enable exploitation.</p>
<p>So does the rental housing market. Unlike most services and commodities, the price tag on rental units has no real relationship to the cost of providing housing. Rents are determined by “what the market will bear,” as economists say. Even if a property has been paid for three times over (by previous tenants), landlords can charge well over the cost of maintaining that unit if that’s what similar units are going for in the market. If the financial plan for a new building is to recover costs over twenty years but the market squeezes more out of tenants than initially forecasted, the result is higher profits sooner than expected, not lower rents. The question is never whether the rental property will generate profit but, rather, how much profit and how soon. The business is stable and lucrative because people have to live somewhere. If the cheapest available option takes the lion’s share of their incomes&mdash;as with a third of tenant families&mdash;they have to take it. Laws, institutions like landlord and tenant boards, and moral standards permit and legitimize wealth accumulation through rent collection.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the 2008 financial meltdown, rental properties became the targets of investors and speculators unwilling to let a good crisis go to waste. The COVID-19 pandemic became an opportunity for landlords to evict tenants, who fell into arrears due to the economic shutdown, and hike up rents. Government actions in recent years included partial cancellation of rent controls, wage freezes, the use of excessive force in the clearing of homeless encampments, the fast-tracking of evictions through virtual hearings, and the failure to protect people living in multi-tenant housing. The air feels heavy. But none of this is fundamentally new&mdash;or unexpected.</p>
<p>The purpose of the rental market is not to ensure the highest possible number of families is securely housed. The purpose of the rental market is to extract income from tenants, and as far as this goal is concerned, it works like a charm!</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">his distinction</span> between a “housing crisis” and a rental market that enables exploitation has practical implications. How we talk about these issues shapes what we conceive as possible and desirable responses to them. A “housing crisis” suggests the need for a technical solution and coordination between various stakeholders, all of whom desire the same outcome: the end of the crisis. Nobody is at fault. Politicizing the issue is unhelpful. We need win-win solutions. The right policy mix, backed by adequate government funding, is the only way forward; it would benefit everyone. This is, by far, the dominant view of how to deal with housing issues in Canada.</p>
<p>In this perspective, the market itself is never the problem. If rents go through the roof, working families cannot afford modest units, and parents have to choose between paying rent and putting food on the table, then something is off with the rental market; it is not working as it should. Real estate lobbyists and some housing experts argue the problem is that supply is not catching up fast enough with demand. If we build more housing, the argument goes, people will have more choices, and rent will be lower. The main problem with this “supply-side” argument is that it is not true.</p>
<p>In Economics 101, students learn the law of supply and demand, wherein prices fall if supply exceeds demand. The real world is more complicated, and that is particularly true of housing markets. There are many reasons for not treating housing as a market that arrives at an optimal balance. The most important is that land, on which housing is built, is a fixed resource. We cannot produce more of it (though we can make better use of urban land). Highly desirable land&mdash;be it downtown Toronto building lots or prairie farmland&mdash;is fixed in quantity and scarce. There is little of it. Those who own it have the upper hand.</p>
<p>Another important difference between real-world rental markets and the law of supply and demand taught in Economics 101 is that housing is not bananas. Bananas spoil quickly, so it is in the interest of sellers to get rid of them, even if for a lower price than initially expected. Housing increases in value over time; someone holding on to an empty apartment in Vancouver is making lots of money in absolute terms, even if comparatively less money than if the apartment were rented. When a new tenant agrees to pay a higher rent for years to come, the waiting pays itself off in a few months, and the rest is profit. The correlation between the supply and price of rental housing is much more complicated than the proponents of “supply-side” arguments make it out to be.</p>
<p>For example, proponents of the “supply-side” argument frequently point to low vacancy rates as an indication that supply is low, which drives rents higher. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the national vacancy rate went up from 2 percent to 3.2 percent, a 60 percent increase. What happened to rents? They, too, went up, by 3.6 percent. In Toronto, vacancy rates more than doubled between October 2019 (1.5 percent) and October 2020 (3.4 percent). What happened to the average rent in the city? It rose by 4.7 percent. A Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation report explained that, in hot markets like Toronto and Montreal, landlords chose to wait longer to fill vacancies or offered one-time rent discounts instead of lowering rents.</p>
<p>In 2021, a prominent housing expert, Steve Pomeroy, demonstrated that “between 2006 and 2016, Canada added 1.636 million households and built 1.919 million new homes . . . almost 30,000 extra homes were constructed each year compared to the increase in the number of households.” And yet housing prices and rents went up at a breakneck speed during those years. Neither Pomeroy nor I contend that Canada has enough housing or that additional supply would not be beneficial. The point is that supply alone will not solve the problem.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smallcaps">hy, then</span>, are “housing crisis” and “supply-side” arguments so prevalent? Canadian political economist Robert Cox famously said, “Theory is always for someone, for some purpose.” He was criticizing studies that take the existing social order and institutions as a given. Problem-solving theories, as he called them, don’t ask how things came to be, who benefits from the way things are, or whether things could be different. Instead, the focus is on smoothing out any troubles with the existing institutions. By not only accepting but helping to troubleshoot the current order, problem-solving theories legitimize and entrench the status quo. While priding itself on being value free and offering practical solutions to concrete problems, this type of research serves the interests of those who are comfortable with the way things are and would rather avoid substantive changes.</p>
<p>A lot of housing research adheres to this problem-solving approach, and in doing so, it serves the interests of the real estate industry. If we believe lack of supply is the cause of lack of housing affordability, the solution is building more. If we build more but rents continue to go up, we must not be building enough. Build more, faster! How? Governments must provide financial and regulatory incentives to developers and remove rent controls so that landlords find the business more attractive. The “supply-side” argument serves a clear purpose: to sweeten the deal for developers and landlords. This argument has been made for decades; it has justified countless subsidies for the real estate industry; it has not lowered rents, and it will not go away either. An argument that so directly supports the interests of an influential economic elite is not going anywhere, no matter how much empirical evidence is mounted against it.</p>
<p>The widespread use of “housing crisis” also helps to preserve the status quo. It reinforces the idea that Canada’s housing system worked well at some point but something unexpected happened, bringing about unseen and widely undesirable outcomes. That’s not true. For a large share of the population, the housing system never worked, and the current state of affairs is making lots of people rich, like very rich. It’s not really a crisis if it has lasted more than a century and large sections of the population wouldn’t have it any different, is it? Still, the housing debate in Canada centres on finding innovative, effective, evidence-based solutions to this so-called crisis. Years come and go. Public consultations lead to expert reports that call for more public consultations. The ultimate outcome of this policy merry-go-round is to conceal the power politics behind housing.</p>

Alongside the leggings and yoga mats was what seemed to be a slender wall-mounted mirror with a glowing white “M” in its centre. When customers tapped on a workout listed on an iPad beside it, the reflective surface turned black. Next to the user’s reflection, an image appeared from the ether&mdash;this time, a man with a pair of dumbbells.</p>
<p>“What’s up, what’s up, what’s up!” the cheery holographic figure called. Pop music started blasting in the background. “Team 100, I’m Gerren Liles, and this is your fifteen-minute training class focused on your arms and your abs.” </p>
<p>Liles is a real human&mdash;a fitness trainer in New York City with 108,000 Instagram followers. He’s also one of the many trainers on Mirror, Lululemon’s futuristic at-home workout device. </p>
<p>Mirror offers both pre-recorded classes and live sessions, and its users see themselves reflected beside their instructor and copy their moves: they walk out to plank position; they do a series of push-ups; they grunt out bicep curls. A counter tracks calories burned and heart rate. In its live classes&mdash;and there are about twenty each day&mdash;the other attendees appear at the bottom, Mirror’s built-in camera streaming a parade of video avatars. Instructors can watch the attendees and give feedback&mdash;“Tap your ankles, Donna Anne,” Liles shouts out during one set of crunches. For those less excited about push-ups, there are other cheerful instructors teaching yoga, Pilates, boxing, dance, barre, and tai chi. Mirror has been billed as the future of exercise: all the personal guidance of a professional instructor in your own home. </p>

</ul>
<p>Mirror was created by Brynn Putnam, a Harvard-educated former ballerina and Lululemon brand ambassador who says she came up with the notion when she was newly pregnant and trying to work out from home. Having already run a boutique fitness studio in New York, Putnam won seed funding to hire a team of engineers to develop the product, eventually launching it in 2018. Mirror quickly gained momentum thanks to endorsements from celebrities such as Alicia Keys and Reese Witherspoon. Ellen DeGeneres called it a “magic mirror” on TV. In early 2020, Putnam said she saw Mirror as the “next iPhone” and “the third screen in people’s homes.”</p>
<p>A few months later, in summer 2020, the fledgling company was snapped up by Vancouver-based Lululemon for $500 million. The devices are now marketed as a luxury product in every sense, with minimalist aesthetics (no unsightly wires or bulky gear) and a maximalist price tag. Mirror screens launched a little more than a year later in Canada at a retail price of $1,900 and carried a $50 per month subscription fee for live classes. With the acquisition, Lululemon heralded a new future: it was now a tech company, awash with all the optimism and opportunity that the designation offers.</p>
<p>When Lululemon bought Mirror, CEO Calvin McDonald said the pandemic helped the company “see quicker into the future”&mdash;and the future was augmented reality. “Guests have accelerated their behavior and accelerated the adoption of in-home sweat,” he said in an interview with the <em>New York Times</em> (“guests” being a Lululemon-ism for customers). It fit into the company’s “Power of Three” business plan, which, along with doubling men’s and online revenue, laid out a vision to become an “experiential brand” that finds customers “across multiple experiences,” including their homes.</p>
<p>Lululemon didn’t have to strain to see the potential in home workouts. In the throes of the pandemic, while the deal was being finalized, no one was going out to gyms or spin classes. Home fitness had a captive market. Peloton, the stationary bike upstart, was selling more units than it could manufacture, even at nearly $2,000 per bike and $55 per month in subscription fees. Its sales shot up 172 percent by September 2020, and its share price skyrocketed approximately 400 percent by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Tamara Szames, a fashion industry expert at the NPD Group, a market research company, says it made sense at the time for Lululemon to think about creating its own workout equipment. It was a way to bring in and keep its own customers “as tight to home as possible.” Companies like Peloton showed it was possible to quickly build closed online communities around products, with some livestreamed classes from quirky personalities. Ideally, this model creates a virtuous circle: people take your classes, buy your products, then take more classes.</p>
<p>But moving into unfamiliar territory also comes with the risk of overextension, especially when the money is flowing. As the lockdowns ended and the world returned to something more akin to normal, the ground shifted once again: customers, no longer content to live behind screens, began seeking real experiences outside their homes. It meant that Lululemon, typically with its finger on the pulse of the fitness world, may have placed a significant bet on a digital future that is nothing more than a passing fad.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n 2020</span>, just about everything that apparel companies thought they knew about their customers seemed to collapse. Overnight, dressing up became a non-starter, and athleisure morphed into a daily uniform. Clothing experts called it “casualization”&mdash;goodbye workplace socials, hello at-home Zoom parties. The trend propelled Lululemon to new heights. Its stores closed in early 2020, but online orders picked up and didn’t stop. By the first three months of 2021, its sales had increased by more than 88 percent from the previous year, reaching $1.2 billion. The people had spoken, and they wanted stretchy pants.</p>
<p>With so much money on the line, apparel companies started looking at what other untapped markets were out there. Pivoting to tech was increasingly seen as the answer. Nike, for one, had millions more people downloading its run club and workout apps in 2020, which it then used to gather data on customers’ exercise routines and place products in home workout videos. It also started making plans to sell virtual NFT shoes in the metaverse. (A year later, after crypto prices crashed, Nike seemed to have distanced itself from these operations.) Alo Yoga, a smaller yoga lifestyle brand endorsed by Kendall Jenner, reported a sevenfold increase in subscriptions to its $20 a month online yoga classes and began expanding its offerings.</p>
<p>Mirror was just one of the moves into health tech for Lululemon. In the summer of 2021, the company announced a new $20 million project called Wellbeing.ai, where it aimed to build a health platform with an artificial intelligence chatbot. The software would harness data like a user’s weight, heart rate, and hours of sleep to give custom lifestyle advice.</p>
<p>When Canada reopened, Lululemon shops added sections that looked more like an Apple Store, with its Mirror products featured prominently. But there were early signs the business was having difficulties with its new product. Putnam, the founder of Mirror, stepped down from her role in 2021. Current and former employees told <em>Business Insider</em> that the acquisition came sooner than expected and technical issues like “buggy” software went ignored. One said members of Lululemon’s marketing teams requested not to be placed on projects involving Mirror because of a lack of clarity in roles and responsibilities. (Lululemon declined requests from The Walrus to speak to a representative or its employees for this story.)</p>
<p>In other boardrooms, the whiplash from the end of lockdowns was more pronounced. It quickly became clear the idea that consumer habits had irrevocably shifted was wrong. Peloton sales began to slump at the end of 2021 as subscriptions declined. The company was forced to pause production the following January as demand waned. One month later, it laid off 2,800 people and announced that its CEO was stepping down. By December 2022, Peloton’s share price had crashed 95 percent from its peak.</p>
<p>Mirror sales didn’t do as well as anticipated either. After setting expected revenue between $250 million and $275 million in 2020, Lululemon cut its projections by half, to between $125 million and $130 million by the end of 2021. The company seemed to have stopped disclosing sales information soon after. On a call with investors in the fourth quarter of 2021, McDonald just said Mirror sales were going as expected and were “consistent with the guidance we provided.” </p>
<p>Chip Wilson, the founder of Lululemon and still its largest individual shareholder, said the company’s stores didn’t have sales processes in place for a tech product, the selling of which is quite different from selling shirts or yoga pants. “Lululemon buying into a technology company and owning it is way outside their area of expertise,” he said during a call in the summer of 2022. “And I would say that they bought it . . . because they had way too much money in the bank. And they didn’t know what to do with it.” Wilson argued that it was a stretch too far: previous diversifications into lines like personal hygiene products and face cleansers had also required an entirely different sales process, but building those had not been as complex an experience as that with Mirror, he added.</p>
<p>Wilson characterized Lululemon’s tech gambit as a short-term decision driven by shareholder pressure: “They knew nothing about the product, they knew nothing about how they were actually going to sell it.” Mirror works for people who are time constrained or isolated but not for those who can access a studio, Wilson argued. “The target market for Lululemon is a thirty-two-year-old single professional, and as soon as COVID ended, those people were bound to go and leave the home technical space.” </p>
<p>Wilson has a tumultuous relationship with Lululemon&mdash;he was forced out of the company not long after giving an interview to Bloomberg in 2013 where he suggested that recalled yoga pants were pilling because “some women’s bodies just actually don’t work for it.” But, he said, he still used to speak to McDonald, the CEO, about the business, and even product ideas, every six months until McDonald went “radio silent” near the beginning of 2021. He said the shift to virtual calls for annual general shareholder meetings meant he was “neutered” by the company board and that they avoid answering his questions, but he added that McDonald himself is a “good CEO.”</p>
<p>Other industry watchers share skepticism about the company’s tech strategy. The device makes a lot of sense as a brand extension for Lululemon and also as a way to sell more clothes, says Louis-Etienne Dubois, associate professor of creative industries management at Toronto Metropolitan University. But, at the same time, it’s a complete departure from its main business: clothing. Tech devices and subscriptions have different supply chains and require new customer service&mdash;which includes training employees to do tech support&mdash;and the profit margins are lower. </p>
<p>Dubois likens Mirror to a video game system. A PlayStation 5 retails for up to $950&mdash;not too far off Mirror’s price point, if you prefer first-person shooters to the downward dog. These devices always cause Sony to lose money out of the gate due to high production and development costs. Still, the company happily eats those losses because it makes a killing on games and its PlayStation Plus subscriptions. Lululemon was probably trying to implement a similar strategy, Dubois says. But this line of business comes with a substantial risk: if people don’t keep up their subscriptions, cash will continue to burn.</p>
<p>“I think that’s what they’re trying to do here&mdash;it’s just to put those things into people’s homes. And then hopefully they like it and they keep on buying those subscriptions,” he says. Lululemon probably didn’t foresee that the end of the pandemic would lead to a boost in demand for real-world experiences and away from big equipment purchases. On top of that, as subscription companies like Netflix have discovered, rising inflation now means that these ongoing expenses are often the first to end up on the chopping block when consumers tighten spending.</p>
<p>Lululemon may have also underestimated how much of a niche market holographic live workouts really are, Dubois says. “[Audiences are] looking for the cheaper alternatives out there,” he says. “Which, again, makes it tricky for Lululemon to be in the business of selling really, really expensive pieces of connected fitness.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="smallcaps">ower than expected</span> Mirror sales probably won’t become an existential problem for Lululemon. In 2021, the devices made up just 3 percent of total revenues. The company has recently cut the price of Mirror by half and offered a raft of incentives for signing up, ranging from discounts on other Lululemon purchases to free fitness classes at stores. Even so, the product’s future may be in doubt. Lululemon wrote off much of the value of the Mirror acquisition in an earnings report in March 2023, marking it down by $442.7 million—close to the $500 million it spent buying the company. &#8220;Mirror hardware sales during the holiday season came in below expectations,&#8221; Lululemon’s chief financial officer Meghan Frank said on the earnings call, and noted that they’re adding “a more efficient app-based model” with a lower subscription rate. </p>
<p>Szames notes the new Mirror memberships&mdash;recently rebranded as Lululemon Studio&mdash;now include discounts at partnering in-person workout studios, helping to make the experience more local. “It’s more of a full-rounded membership that they’re offering,” she says. The brand is going back to the yoga studio environments that served it so well in the past&mdash;the future will be less digital than it seemed in 2020.</p>
<p>Market research has shown that people generally value experiences over things, says Dubois. During the pandemic, people couldn’t go out and do much of anything, so products had to suffice. But now it’s back to experiences: travel, restaurants, sports, concerts, amusement parks, exercise classes. “When you’re working out in your living room, by yourself, even though it’s really cool&mdash;even though you get the sense of having a one-on-one workout&mdash;there’s hardly a sense of escapism,” he says.</p>
<p>It may just be bad luck that Lululemon was sending the opposite message when it started selling Mirror, a piece of workout equipment that emphasizes at-home individuality. The camaraderie of a real exercise class is part of the appeal of companies like CrossFit, SoulCycle, and, yes, Lululemon. Virtual experiences, no matter how impressive, still miss something vital. The sounds and the presence of other people, the feelings of suffering and succeeding together&mdash;these are not things that a glossy screen can yet replace. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/lululemon-tried-to-become-a-tech-company-it-didnt-work-out/">Lululemon Tried to Become a Tech Company.

But despite cautious optimism from economists, grocery store prices are still going up, with the cost of food rising at a pace double that of regular inflation. Among the items that have seen the sharpest increase, compared to their 2022 prices, are kitchen staples like pasta (nearly 23 percent), lettuce (about 20 percent), butter (just over 19 percent), apples (nearly 17 percent), and fruit juices (close to 16 percent). Millions of Canadians can no longer afford their grocery bill; meanwhile, food bank use is predicted to increase 60 percent this year, according to a recent survey by Second Harvest. We asked Sylvain Charlebois, the director of Dalhousie University’s Agri-Food Analytics Lab and the project lead on <a href="https://www.dal.ca/sites/agri-food/research/canada-s-food-price-report-2023.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Canada’s Food Price Report 2023,</a> to explain what’s behind the sticker shock. </p>
<p><strong>Nicole Schmidt:</strong> What are the biggest reasons food price inflation is outpacing overall inflation?</p>
<p><strong>Sylvain Charlebois:</strong> The first reason is supply chains. The time it takes to move products from suppliers to grocery stores has gone up because of rising energy costs and labour shortages. It’s like blocking a garden hose. When you play around with it, the water will eventually flow through, but it takes time before the hose gets back to normal. The second factor is <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/climate-change/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">climate change</a>. Prices are expected to rise as a result of droughts and other climate catastrophes. California has already been impacted, and so has Spain. Third, <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/ukraine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ukraine</a> is a big deal. The country can feed 400 million people with its agriculture during a normal year, so obviously the war has impacted its ability to feed the world.  	</p>

</ul>
<p>Food inflation rates vary from one country to another. Take Canada. At 10.3 percent, our rate is actually one of the lowest among the G7 countries, with only the US and Japan ranking lower. According to the Consumer Price Index, food inflation in the European Union has been above 15 percent for a while. A lot of central banks have raised interest rates in an attempt to bring down inflation, and some have been successful to an extent. But unfortunately, interest rates don’t really have a short-term impact on food prices.</p>
<p><strong>NS:</strong> When I was in Canada, I spent more money at the grocery store than I do in Germany.</p>
<p><strong>SC:</strong> According to a <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/greedflation-83-of-canadian-grocery-shoppers-say-grocers-and-food-producers-are-using-inflation-as-an-excuse-to-price-gouge-878512588.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent poll</a> by global marketing agency Mintel, 83 percent of Canadians believe grocers are mainly to blame for high food prices. As an economist, I can understand why people think that. But our research at the Agri-Food Analytics Lab doesn’t indicate any evidence of greed in retail. Canada is a very challenging market to serve, given the vastness and population density that we have. The Canadian branches of many companies like Sears, Target, and Lowe’s have failed, in part, because of interprovincial barriers. There’s no one Canada; there’s several provinces and territories with different sets of rules, which is very different from the UK, or Germany, or other countries. So that’s one reason why food distribution in Canada is so costly. </p>
<p><strong>NS:</strong> Loblaw Q4 profits&mdash;and here I mean the company as a whole, not simply the supermarkets&mdash;were over $500 million. According to <a href="https://proof.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Household-Food-Insecurity-in-Canada-2021-PROOF.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a 2021 report</a>, nearly one in six Canadian households is facing food insecurity. You’re saying it doesn’t seem like grocery stores are playing as big of a role in the price increases as we think they are. But then why are they still turning these big profits?</p>
<p><strong>SC:</strong>  It’s because of non-food items. When you look at their financial statements, for example, you’ll see that food sales were up 8.4 percent, while food inflation was well above 11 percent during that quarter. This means that Loblaw is treading water with food sales at best. When you look at Shoppers Drug Mart, however, their storefront sales are up almost 12 percent, which means that they’re making money selling prescription drugs and other things, which is how Loblaw is making much of its money. </p>
<p><strong>NS:</strong> I read a price comparison of the same products at different grocery stores, and there was almost a $3 difference between peanut butter at Loblaws supermarket versus No Frills and a $7 difference between laundry detergent. But both stores are owned by the same company.  </p>
<p><strong>SC:</strong>  It’s called strategy. I don’t think consumers understand how much influence they themselves have on food prices. Each store deals with a different demographic and a different market, so it makes sense for one to offer a product at a certain price. People say it’s gouging, but to me, it’s not, because customers aren’t forced to buy something at a certain price. They could just go to the other store. And if prices everywhere were to be the same, grocers would likely be accused of collusion, which is something that we don’t want either. So both scenarios are losing scenarios for grocers right now. </p>
<p><strong>NS:</strong> Approximately 80 percent of grocery sales in Canada are controlled by the same five chains. Does that at all have an impact on prices and how our grocery store ecosystem functions?</p>
<p><strong>SC:</strong>  Oh, absolutely. This is a problem in Canada. We haven’t really done a good job of protecting independents. The five players controlling everything right now have too much power, which is why there is talk of establishing a grocer code of conduct. That would lessen the power companies like Loblaw and Walmart have in the market because, right now, they’re squeezing suppliers, and suppliers aren’t giving good deals to independents. That’s why independents are either being bought out or they’re disappearing. In many small towns across the country, you have only one grocery shop left, and when you have only one grocery shop left, guess what happens to food prices? They go up.</p>
<p><strong>NS:</strong> A scenario we go back to a lot is the bread price fixing scandal, which revealed that some of Canada’s major grocery stores were, for several years, coordinating price increases. How can we trust these institutions when things like this are going on?</p>
<p><strong>SC:</strong>  This is the other factor fuelling the hatred toward Loblaw’s CEO Galen Weston. I think Canadians feel unprotected. And this is something I said when I testified in parliament in December as part of the food inflation investigation. If the Competition Bureau goes to a company to ask for data, the company can easily refuse. That wouldn’t happen in the US. It’s just a different regime altogether.</p>
<p><strong>NS:</strong> The role of the Competition Bureau is to keep an eye on everything going on to ensure fair play is happening?</p>
<p><strong>SC:</strong>   Their main role is to assure that the Canadian public is protected, that competition laws are not breached, and that competition is upheld in some way. Whenever there’s a merger or an acquisition, the Competition Bureau is always asked to evaluate, but we have seen major acquisitions in the grocery business in the last twenty to thirty years and nobody seemed to pay much attention until prices became an issue. In 1998, Loblaws bought Provigo in Quebec and nobody blinked an eye. In 2005, Metro bought A&#038;P and nobody said anything. In 2013, Sobeys bought Safeway&mdash;nothing. So, in 2018, when Sobeys’ parent company, Empire, bought Farm Boy, we were asked by the bureau to comment. Farm Boy was an independent grocer with twenty-six stores, so we told them we didn’t think Canadians would be impacted but that they need to be careful with independents. Three years later, when Sobeys bought Longo’s&mdash;another independent grocery chain—we were asked to comment again, and we said, “Well, that changes our conversation about Farm Boy, doesn’t it?” Because all of a sudden if you have scores of stores being bought out, that’s going to become a problem. You could tell they had no clue what we were talking about. </p>
<p>Look at what’s going on between the Kroger and Albertsons grocery store chains in the US. Congress is actually looking at how consumers in New Haven, Connecticut, are going to be impacted by that merger. The approach is so granular. But it would never happen in Canada right now. </p>
<p><strong>NS:</strong> What exactly is at the heart of the difference?</p>
<p><strong>SC:</strong> Canada’s Competition Act, which is supposed to encourage equitable opportunity among businesses regardless of their size. The act itself doesn’t really give a whole lot of clout to the Competition Bureau. Meanwhile, the White House will not hesitate to get involved. A couple of years ago, the White House got investigators involved in meat packing to see whether or not there was collusion going on.  </p>
<p><strong>NS:</strong> And our federal government wouldn’t get involved in the same capacity?</p>
<p><strong>SC:</strong> It would never happen right now in Canada&mdash;ever. </p>
<p><strong>NS:</strong> The increases for food prices this year exceeded the original predictions, and I know you put out predictions for next year. So is it possible that next year’s food price increases could exceed what you predict as well?   </p>
<p><strong>SC:</strong> I hope not. In 2021, when we released our predictions for 2022, we were expecting increases of 7 percent. At the time, many, many people accused us of being alarmist. We ended out the year at over 10 percent inflation. This year, we estimated 5–7 percent, and nobody’s calling us alarmist anymore&mdash;but I certainly hope that I’m wrong.</p>
<p><strong>NS:</strong> Another big question: Are food prices doomed to stay this high, or is there a chance we might see them decline in, like, the next year or two?</p>
<p><strong>SC:</strong> Highly unlikely. In fact, I recently met with at least thirty-five companies&mdash;suppliers, not grocers&mdash;and they’re all seeing the same thing. Last year created a new baseline. Commodity prices aren’t necessarily going up, but the cost of everything is. Packaging rules are changing all over the world, and so packaging is actually going to cost way more. Salaries are expected to go up too. Someone has to pay for that. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/will-groceries-ever-be-affordable/">Will Groceries Ever Be Affordable?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

But Sarah Broad, a shift supervisor with about four years’ experience at Starbucks, says, “It started as a little bit of a joke.” </p>
<p>It was the early days of the pandemic. Broad says communication was poor and tensions were high between the company and the store’s thirty or so employees. When it came to COVID-19 precautions, “we were being told one thing and then a week later being told something else,” she says. “We felt like we didn’t know what was going on and like we were being taken advantage of.”</p>
<p>Staff were burned out. They felt they were risking their health for low pay and lacked job security, particularly as hours were cut. The usual routes for complaints&mdash;approaching store management or calling the Ethics &#038; Compliance Helpline&mdash;weren’t yielding results. Broad’s mother was in a union, and other employees had family members whose workplaces were unionized. From everything they heard, banding together seemed like a better option for the store’s staff than going through corporate channels individually. After about a month of internal discussions, one barista reached out to some unions to gauge interest.</p>
<p>Pablo Guerra, a United Steelworkers union (USW) organizer, admits there was initially hesitation in bringing Starbucks into the fold. But the stories he heard, ranging from challenges acquiring PPE to worker harassment by customers, convinced him it was an important fight. For employees, it usually takes only their time and efforts to launch a union bid, but unions themselves have to cover all the costs of planning and organizing, as dues are collected once a collective agreement has been reached. “It’s not just about money,” Guerra says. “It’s about respect. It’s about dignity.” Shortly after their initial conversations, Broad and more than 90 percent of her colleagues signed union cards. After a final vote, it was official: their Starbucks had joined the USW.</p>
<p>Unions are typically associated with longer-term careers: automakers, public sector jobs, skilled trades. Starbucks, like other food services and retail workplaces, is often viewed as a first job for teenagers or university students seeking a few shifts. </p>
<p>However, the service industry has been undergoing a shift in recent years. According to a 2019 Statistics Canada study, while a majority of minimum-wage earners are under twenty-five, about 45 percent are now older workers trying to carve out a life amid low salaries and often irregular schedules. Since at least the late 1990s, the accommodation and food services sector has had among the lowest unionization rates in Canada, at just 4.9 percent in 2021. But that may be changing, and Starbucks has emerged at the front line.</p>

</ul>
<p>Workers have been voicing everything from health and safety concerns to problems with understaffing and pay. The company produced record revenues in 2022, hitting $32.25 billion (US) globally, though a full-time barista in Canada might only earn between $15 and $20.45 an hour. Even at the highest end, that’s far below $31.37, the average hourly wage in Canada across all occupations. Some Starbucks workers, fed up with the status quo, say unions can be a solution to the many problems plaguing the sector as a whole.</p>
<p>Today, Broad says, the Victoria store is often contacted by other outlets interested in unionizing. And, though only six stores in BC and Alberta have made the jump in Canada, in the United States, it’s become a flood. In December 2021, an outlet in Buffalo, New York, became the first recent corporate-owned location to unionize in the US. In the twelve months that followed, more than 260 others joined it. </p>
<p>While that’s still a small percentage of the chain’s 10,000-plus stores in North America, the numbers are hard to ignore. But, as many have discovered, organizing&mdash;and seeing results&mdash;is easier said than done.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="smallcaps">tarbucks has a</span> fraught history with unions. In 1985, the company, then nearly fifteen years old, was still a relatively small operation, with a handful of stores around Seattle. That year, some of its employees joined the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), securing benefits like health care coverage and paid vacation for part-time workers.</p>
<p>In 1987, Howard Schultz bought the company and became CEO. As described in his 1997 memoir, Schultz viewed collective action as a sign of poor morale and mistrust among employees, and he sought to quell it. He wrote, “If [workers] had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn’t need a union.”</p>
<p>Schultz began a push to convince workers that organizing went against their best interests. As the number of stores increased, he made claims that Starbucks was a worker-friendly operation, the first US company to offer part timers health benefits. He promoted the line that a direct relationship between employer and employee, without a union getting in the way, would only improve things. Not long after, the workers moved to decertify and leave the union. Yet, as <em>Politico</em> reported in 2019, many of the benefits the company touted were first secured by the union itself.</p>
<p>John Bowman, a former Canadian Auto Workers union organizer, says that, throughout the ’90s and early 2000s, new union attempts would occasionally crop up at Starbucks. Back then, he worked with about a dozen locations in Metro Vancouver that found early, though short-lived, success with unionization. “To me, the organizing is the easier part,” he says. “The real issue is how are you going to build unionization in a workforce of that nature.”</p>
<p>Unionization, no matter the sector, does not mean instant gratification, Bowman says. This can pose a challenge when a movement is still young, as the payoff for workers doesn’t automatically follow a successful vote. It’s also difficult in industries with high turnover. And, in the food services industry, sometimes nearly all of a store’s employees can come and go over the course of a year. As a result, union interest can rapidly shift as advocates leave for other jobs. </p>
<p>Bowman recalls that some people thought it would be easy to bargain with Starbucks due to its progressive image. They believed once headquarters “got over a little snit about [them] unionizing,” they would easily work together. But, Bowman says, this wasn’t the case: though the company uses the right lingo to position itself as worker friendly and socially responsible, he says, it didn’t want to cede any of its power. “They’re really a more sophisticated Walmart,” he says.</p>
<p>This all ultimately proved fatal to those early Canadian Starbucks unions. Eventually, the Vancouver movement fizzled out, and all the unionized stores from the 1990s ultimately moved to decertify. In a statement to The Walrus, Starbucks said, “From the beginning, we’ve been clear in our belief that we are better together as partners, without a union between us, and that conviction has not changed.”</p>
<p>The question for organizers is whether things will be any different now. In the 1990s, full-time baristas weren’t highly paid, but many managed to get by better than they can today as the cost of living was significantly lower. Now, whether workers are in cities like Toronto and Vancouver with sky-high rents or living out in the suburbs, average pay doesn’t meet the necessary living wage. In many Canadian cities, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment now exceeds $2,000&mdash;a cost that would eat up nearly all of a barista’s typical monthly earnings.</p>
<p>For Broad, it’s easy to point out how unionizing has drastically improved her Victoria workplace over the past two and a half years. Grievance procedures are now clear. The common union practice of using seniority when determining schedules means that pay isn’t ruled by a manager’s whims. (Cutting hours as punishment is common in the industry, as is doling out hours to show favouritism.) There’s also a freely available collective agreement, which gives new employees information that can be opaque in the service industry: everything from pay scale to vacation policies and leave requirements.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean the process has been straightforward. Broad alleges that, after the successful union vote, Starbucks dragged its feet on finalizing their collective agreement, which wasn’t ratified for nearly a year. (In a statement to The Walrus, Starbucks stated: “In all union dealings, including collective bargaining, we have, and always will engage honestly and in good faith.”) And, in May 2022, the company announced a Canada-wide pay increase&mdash;one that, Broad says, excluded the unionized store. Though this “was frustrating to see,” she says, she still feels the decision to unionize was the right one, especially as annual raises are now built into their agreement.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">ccording to</span> Julia Smith, assistant professor of labour studies at the University of Manitoba, there’s a connection between worker activism and times of upheaval, like the two world wars and the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919, which started after high inflation and unemployment spurred about 30,000 people to take to the streets.</p>
<p>But the latter half of the twentieth century saw the labour movement slow down. As employment shifted away from manufacturing, Canadian union membership declined: from 38 percent in 1981 to 29 percent by 2022. In recent years, labour actions, like the fight for $15 minimum wage and attempts to organize gig-economy workers, have attracted attention, but seismic movements have been absent. “We don’t see a lot of those big organizing drives today in the same way, so it can feel daunting,” says Smith.</p>
<p>Organizing food and retail workplaces has proved particularly challenging. The accommodation and food services sector and the retail sector now make up over one in six workers&mdash;more than 3 million Canadian employees&mdash;but they’re dispersed across a large number of workplaces. While other blue-collar industries like manufacturing may have thousands of workers under one roof who can band together, a single fast-food restaurant may have only a dozen or so. This makes it difficult to build influence. Grocery stores are a rare exception in the sector due to factors such as their large staffs and long history of organizing dating back to the late 1800s. According to UFCW, about 40 percent of all grocery store workers&mdash;more than 140,000 in Canada&mdash;are part of the union.</p>
<p>It also doesn’t help that many big employers appear to fight unionization attempts with all they have. Walmart has been criticized for closing stores in retaliation for union activity&mdash;most notably in 2005, when it shuttered its first North American store to unionize, in Jonquière, Quebec. This past July, Starbucks Workers United, which represents workers at about 200 locations in the US, filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board after Starbucks announced it was closing more than a dozen of its stores over safety concerns, which the SBWU claimed was actually in retaliation for union activity. In a statement, Starbucks denied the allegation, and said, “There will be no tolerance for any unlawful anti-union behaviour, if ever found to be true.”</p>
<p>Employees have also accused managers at two Starbucks locations in the US of telling them that unionizing could jeopardize their gender-affirming health care coverage. (Starbucks has denied these allegations.) And, in a company-wide letter, Starbucks said that benefits and wages for unionized employees would “essentially be frozen while the parties negotiate the contract.” Workers allege that the chain is prolonging contract discussions&mdash;the Victoria location remains the only one to finalize a collective agreement so far.</p>
<p>Yet, as the effects of COVID-19 continue to ripple through the economy, there are more and more unions formed by workers, from cannabis retailers to Indigo locations, to draw inspiration from. Efforts have also been made at Amazon warehouses in Montreal and Nisku, near Edmonton. “I’m especially excited because it seems like it’s being led by the workers themselves and a lot of young workers,” Smith says.</p>
<p>This was the case in Lethbridge, Alberta (where I once worked during my three years as a barista). The city of about 100,000 was recently host to one of the most ambitious Starbucks union attempts yet. In May 2022, employees at five corporate-owned locations announced they were holding a joint vote to unionize together. A majority of employees signed union cards, leading to an official vote, which was scheduled to take place in July.</p>
<p>By law, there are usually about two weeks between when employees sign their union cards and the official ballots come due in the province&mdash;a delay during which the Alberta Labour Relations Board conducts investigations to make sure that the proper procedures have been followed. (A handful of other provinces allow for single-step certification, where a workplace can be unionized automatically if a certain percentage of employees sign union cards.) According to a recent complaint to the board, eleven workers alleged that Starbucks used this time to try to prevent the Lethbridge union from proceeding. They accused the company of “decreasing hours of work during the certification campaign,” “sending a negative message to thwart the Union’s organizing efforts,” and denying one employee’s “transfer request due to his support for and activity in the Union, which lead to his termination of employment.” (Starbucks has denied the allegations, stating, “All claims of anti-union actions or union-busting are false. To be clear, no Starbucks partner has been or will be disciplined or separated for supporting, organizing or otherwise engaging in lawful union activity.”)</p>
<p>When votes were finally counted in September, it was a tie. The union lost by default. Even so, workers say the fight continues. According to one employee, they immediately began planning the next vote: store by store this time rather than all together. In December, employees at the West Lethbridge Towne Centre location were the first to fill in their ballots. As of early January, the results were still being determined. </p>
<p>Broad says, with economic anxiety growing amid predictions of a 2023 recession, now may be a critical time to act. Her union contract offers the job security that’s often absent for her peers at other locations, covering everything from wage increases to hours based on seniority. And, according to the agreement, Starbucks and the union must discuss alternatives before any layoffs proceed. If there’s no other option, they are to be done in reverse order of seniority and feature a recall clause&mdash;offering more security than workers had before. “If anytime is going to be successful for this movement, it would be right now,” Broad says, “when people need this extra support more than ever.” </p>

There’s a term for the lingering outline of the still-readable letters in the buildup of dust and grime: label scar. Though the discount department store Zellers has largely disappeared from the Canadian landscape since its closure roughly a decade ago, the ghosts of its name and logo were still identifiable on buildings across the country years later.      </p>
<p>Founded in 1931 in London, Ontario, Zellers reached its zenith in the late ’90s with about 350 locations coast to coast. In 2011, after years of increased competition from the expansion of US discount stores such as Walmart into Canadian territory, the Hudson’s Bay Company, which had acquired Zellers in the 1970s, transferred the leases of nearly 220 Zellers stores to Target, effectively snuffing out the retailer (a handful of Zellers liquidation outlets lingered until 2020). But Target faltered in Canada, losing almost $1 billion less than a year after launching. It pulled out in 2015, shutting down all its locations in the country. Since then, suburban and exurban landscapes have been haunted by big, empty stores. Canadians on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/social-media/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">social media</a> have regularly shared images of these dead spaces as well as calls to bring back the homegrown bargain brand. Since Target’s retreat, they have frequently waxed poetic about Zellers’ in-house diner, the Skillet, or its teddy bear mascot Zeddy, or shared retro videos and photos of the stores. These outpourings regularly spawn articles pointing out the spikes in nostalgia. Since 2020, the online outlet <em>Narcity</em> has published more than twenty stories about Zellers, <a href="https://www.narcity.com/tweets-about-zellers-coming-back-to-canada-that-will-make-you-chuckle" rel="noopener" target="_blank">many of which</a> feature TikToks and tweets about the brand. In “<a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2021/12/11/whats-your-favourite-90s-mall-store-vote-in-our-nostalgic-holiday-shopping-bracket.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zellers, Terrazzo, and Vibes: An Ode to the ’90s Shopping Mall</a>,” <em>Toronto Star</em> reporter Karon Liu wrote that Zellers met with an “unjust end.” Readers seemed to agree and voted Zellers their favourite nostalgic mall store out of sixteen contenders in the <em>Star</em>&thinsp;’s <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2021/12/11/whats-your-favourite-90s-mall-store-vote-in-our-nostalgic-holiday-shopping-bracket.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2021 mall madness bracket</a>.</p>

<li><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/how-do-you-make-the-perfect-toy/">How Do You Make the Perfect Toy?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In August 2022, the Hudson’s Bay Company <a href="https://www.hbc.com/news/article/shoppers-have-something-to-zelebrate-zellers-to-launch-first-ever-ecommerce-site-and-expand-store-footprint/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> it would be reviving Zellers within existing retail space at Bay locations as well as with a digital shopping site. There was a sense of jubilation among the nostalgic on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and other social media channels. (It was often followed by secondary outpourings of nostalgia for other defunct Canadian discount stores such as BiWay, dead in 2001, or Bargain Harold’s, which went into receivership in 1992.) Readers shared Zellers anecdotes with major media outlets across the country. </p>
<p>But why do so many Canadians seem hungry for the return of the chain? We’re living in a moment rich with cheap goods and discount retailers. Walmart has more than 400 locations in Canada, Dollarama is a juggernaut with more than 1,400 stores, and Amazon offers same-day shipping to cities including Toronto, Vancouver, and Calgary. Canadians’ love for Zellers and excitement for its resurrection appears to lay bare not just the underlying economic and existential fears of the moment but also the anxieties of a relatively new country familiar with turning to corporate scripts when it comes to defining national identity.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t could be argued</span> that the internet has given us nostalgia on steroids, never letting us forget what toys and movies and brands we once loved and speeding up the pace at which we look back. In a 2014 piece for <em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/02/how-the-internet-uses-nostalgia/283966/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a></em>, Megan Garber noted that nostalgia “at its most basic level requires access to memories&mdash;and there is, of course, no better archive than the Internet.” Media outlets are also complicit, Garber suggests, with publications as varied as <em>BuzzFeed</em>, <em>New York</em> magazine, and even the future-oriented <em>Wired</em> publishing stories focused on the past. In 2015, <em><a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/early-onset-nostalgia-surge-cola-mad-libs-renaissance/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Digiday</a></em> diagnosed millennials, the first generation of “digital natives,” with “early onset nostalgia” thanks to technology, information overload, and economic anxiety. Gen Z is already looking back even though the oldest of the demographic are still in their twenties, with <em><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjpn73/gen-z-are-already-nostalgic-for-2014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vice</a></em> noting a zoomer fascination with trends from 2014&mdash;not exactly a bygone era.</p>
<p>Although Zellers may have become something of a meme for a lot of younger Canadians, there remains a major sense of loss on a physical, community level for those who miss an affordable, homegrown brand. In social media comments and in news outlets’ calls for memories, Zellers has been called a “community staple” in rural areas and small towns as well as a meeting place for families and seniors. In the <em>Toronto Star</em>, a <a href="https://www.thestar.com/opinion/letters_to_the_editors/2023/01/22/in-sudbury-wed-welcome-zellers.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">letter to the editor</a> referencing a January announcement of twenty-five revived Zellers locations, noted that Sudbury, Ontario, once home to two Zellers, would not see the retailer’s return. </p>
<p>Some of the longing for the return of Zellers also appears to be tied to former jobs, eating at the in-store restaurant, or <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/shopping/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shopping</a> there with a grandmother. Dan Guadagnolo remembers shopping at Zellers with his grandmother and father while growing up in Brampton, Ontario. Now an assistant professor at the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information, and Technology at the University of Toronto Mississauga, Guadagnolo notes that, in the past ten years, social media channels have generated a lot of “very sentimental Canadiana nostalgia.” Part of that involves the endless churn of content creation and sharing on the internet. Given how huge Zellers once was, “the scale of its familiarity is going to be something that makes us want to offer it to other people,” he says. </p>
<p>That willingness to share and champion Zellers almost feels at odds with the fact that, as a brand, Zellers wasn’t particularly fashionable in its heyday. In “A Eulogy to Zellers” published in <em><a href="https://thegauntlet.ca/2019/09/27/a-eulogy-to-zellers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Gauntlet</a></em> in 2019, Hannah Brunn notes that, by her teen years, the store’s clothing options weren’t “cool enough.” </p>
<p>Even Zellers appeared to be somewhat aware of this. Ads from decades ago feel like a stark contrast to the more recent public displays of affection for the brand. A tagline featured in commercials from the ’80s suggests a slight sense of shame or embarrassment about shopping there or being thrifty in general: “Only you know how little you paid.” One commercial with the slogan features children dancing in bright-coloured clothes. A voiceover announces, “Clothes from Zellers bring out your kids’ styles loud and clear. But they don’t make a sound about how little you paid.” It ends with a wide-eyed boy covering his mouth with his hand. Another TV ad for homewares highlights “Style&mdash;mood&mdash;secrecy” and ends with a fashionable woman, watch and jewellery sparkling, holding her finger up in an exaggerated shushing sign. </p>
<p>Guadagnolo says Zellers was never particularly cool. But there’s been a shift with time. “It’s the fact that we all kind of remember it that’s made it cool. And remember it in these very digital ways.” Instagramming a photo of a former Zellers store or tweeting about your favourite meal at the Skillet can fuel discussions online and generate a sense of well-being and community. </p>
<p>Companies routinely monitor these trips down memory lane using “social listening”&mdash;tuning in to conversations, keywords, and trends related to a specific brand&mdash;to see if the brand is worth a comeback or a marketing campaign geared toward the past. The official <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zellersofficial/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zellers Instagram account</a>, which went live in late 2022, has tapped directly into these social media conversations. Nostalgia and throwbacks are referenced directly in some of its early posts, while some others feature the excited tweets of Zellers fans superimposed on top retro photos of the retailer.</p>
<p>The current love for Zellers also feels connected to a larger trend when it comes to the marketing of discount retailers: it’s become savvy or even chic to buy inexpensive goods, removing any sense of embarrassment or need to maintain secrecy for not being able to afford higher-priced options. Last year, the second-hand chain store Value Village opened two “boutique” locations in downtown Toronto. Recent Instagram posts from the company often feature the hashtag #thriftproud alongside photos of fashionable young women. Some posts use “haul” language and pictures of full shopping carts. </p>
<p>Marketers have managed to recast low prices as a gateway to abundance. Other companies have successfully suggested that shopping choices are less about economic necessity and more about getting more. No Frills, the discount grocery chain owned by Loblaw, has also seen success with similar messaging in its swaggering #Hauler campaign, which later included superhero-like shoppers enjoying the thrill of buying more groceries for less. No Frills’ No Name store brand, which features plain packaging in yellow and black, has been an inspiration to artists and a design darling among minimalists. In the past five years, Loblaw seems to have picked up on the vibe and launched national campaigns where yellow and black ads have taken over entire subway platforms and city buildings. No Frills marketing merchandise, including bags and scarves, has also proven popular. Amid news that the company was launching a clothing line in its trademark yellow and black, Mary MacIsaac, senior vice president of marketing at Loblaw, <a href="https://toronto.citynews.ca/2018/05/04/no-frills-hauler-clothing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">told the Canadian Press</a> that customers were wearing the gear as a kind of “badge of honour.” The Hamilton-based band Arkells shot an entire music video inside a No Frills, the yellow and black branding clearly visible.</p>
<p>But this wider embrace or memeification of a discount brand can be unsettling for those who grew up low income. Anna May Henry is an artist who has used No Name imagery in her work to explore how growing up poor shaped her identity. “For so many people buying budget food isn’t a cute or cool choice, but a matter of survival. I’ve had people approach my work without looking at it too hard with comments like ‘Oh my god, No Name&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;so funny,’ which could not be farther from where I’m coming from,” she says in an email. “[It] speaks to a general tongue in cheek attitude about the brand, which seems to be most likely coming from a population that didn’t experience the shame of living below the poverty line.” However, she notes that making these products more fun and appealing likely helps in destigmatizing poverty in the grocery aisle.</p>
<p>Jenna Jacobson, an associate professor at the Ted Rogers School of Retail Management at Toronto Metropolitan University, says that part of the recent fervour for Zellers has to do with a real sense of financial anxiety in our current moment. Most large retailers try to attract multiple demographics: it makes business sense for a discount chain to try and attract both lower-income and higher-income shoppers. And companies such as Walmart also benefit during troubling economic times, <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2022/08/16/why-rich-people-are-shopping-at-walmart" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to <em>Morning Brew</em></a>, in part because the average person’s purchasing power decreases but also because of what economists call “trading down”&mdash;people with means swapping high-priced items for cheaper versions.</p>
<p>“Social media is often criticized for bringing out the curated, edited experiences&mdash;this aspirational view of people’s lives,” says Jacobson. While pledging one’s allegiance to a bargain brand doesn’t change that, she says, it may be an attempt by some people to show a kind of perceived realness online. “It’s an attempt at almost positioning oneself as authentic.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">N</span><span class="smallcaps">ot everyone</span> is excited about the return of Zellers. Following the announcement of its resurrection, James Peters called the phenomenon “puzzling” in <a href="https://cfjctoday.com/2022/08/19/peters-nostalgia-is-a-powerful-drug-but-is-it-powerful-enough-to-sustain-a-zellers-revival/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an opinion piece</a> in the Kamloops-based outlet <em>CFJC Today</em>: “People remember&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp; what, exactly? The smell? The products that could be purchased at half-a-dozen other places at the same price point?” He and many others have suggested Canadians aren’t really pining for the retail chain but for a lost era instead. Jacobson shares the idea that nostalgia for a simpler time is particularly appealing now, given the overall feeling of anxiety related not just to financial difficulties but the pandemic as well.</p>
<p>In a paper from a 2011 marketing conference, Jana Rutherford and Eric H. Shaw found that “when consumers encounter periods of discontinuity they tend to become more nostalgic.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp; [N]ostalgic behavior of consumers is a defense mechanism used to deal with negative emotions about the present or concern for the future.”  Pointing to a 1992 study in the <em>Journal of Advertising</em>, they suggested it showed that “the use of nostalgia in marketing would become more prevalent as consumers became discontented with the present or anticipated a bleak future and therefore wanted to return to a more pleasant past.”  </p>
<p>Nostalgia marketing has become a major force in recent years, with business publications and outlets such as <em><a href="https://www.prdaily.com/nostalgia-marketing-why-it-works/">PR Daily</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/01/27/the-branding-power-of-nostalgia-where-it-can-take-you/?sh=5e2ce55f3218" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Forbes</a></em> pointing out the business benefits of tapping into the feeling. In some cases, nostalgia marketing has involved the hyped-up return of discontinued products as part of a special limited-time campaign. Last year, McDonalds brought back its Boo Buckets for a few days before Halloween, swapping out the usual red Happy Meal boxes for the plastic trick-or-treating buckets it made popular in the 1980s. Also last year, Pepsi revived Crystal Pepsi for the thirtieth anniversary of the flavour, using the hashtag #showusyour90s on social media. </p>
<p>A 2021 report from Talkwalker, a company that looks into social media trends and consumer insights, found that keywords related to nostalgia and remembering the past shot up from a baseline of 13 million mentions to 24.4 million as soon as COVID-19 lockdowns started. The upheaval of the pandemic may have encouraged companies to tap into warm and fuzzy feelings relating to bygone times. “Nostalgia is a very powerful marketing mechanism,” Guadagnolo says, “especially in a country like Canada where we are so used to and so familiar with brands really, really latching on to identity and shared experience.”</p>
<p>Think of the enormously popular “I am Canadian” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMxGVfk09lU&#038;ab_channel=SHNKArchives" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Molson beer commercial</a> from 2000 which featured a rant from “Joe Canada” describing all the ways in which Canadians differ from and are superior to our neighbours to the south. (“I believe in peacekeeping, not policing, diversity, not assimilation.”) Then heritage minister Sheila Copps even played the commercial for a crowd of Americans in Boston as part of an official government conference. Or think of how Tim Hortons, owned by a huge multinational, has become a signifier of Canadianness, signalling through its ads that we’re a hockey-loving, community-oriented people. The brand has even been used as a<a href="https://thewalrus.ca/how-tim-hortons-became-a-political-prop/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> prop by politicians</a>. Former prime minister Stephen Harper used it frequently for announcements and photo-ops, and prime minister Justin Trudeau has made campaign stops at Tim Hortons as well. Zellers, it seems, isn’t far behind. In the lead-up to the Conservative Party leadership race in July 2020, Peter MacKay, a lawyer and former cabinet minister, responded to a post from a Zellers parody account calling on all leadership candidates to offer support for the retailer. MacKay, the son of a former federal cabinet minister, shared an early memory of Christmas shopping at Zellers with his grandmother. “Going to Zellers from a rural community outside New Glasgow was like going to New York City!” he tweeted. </p>
<p>Part of this is by design. Being Canadian is hard-baked into the Zellers brand. Following Walmart’s arrival in Canada in 1994, ads in the mid-’90s emphasized the company’s Canadianness. In one commercial, amid footage of farmers, construction workers, and restaurant servers, a voiceover announces, “It takes a Canadian to know how hard Canadians work,” and ends with: “Zellers&mdash;your truly Canadian store.” As Walmart made further inroads into the country, Zellers was forced to give up its slogan that the “lowest price is the law” in part because competitors were beating it on prices. In an interview with the <em>Globe and Mail</em> in 1998, a member of the ad agency responsible for Zellers’ catchphrase mourned its retirement, saying that it was as Canadian as the flag: “It’s part of our lexicon, it’s part of our vocabulary.” The Bay has picked up on this. In the press release announcing the return of the store, it called Zellers “a brand deeply rooted in the Canadian experience.”</p>
<p>For online Zellers nostalgia, undercurrents of nationalistic sentiment aren’t hard to find. In 2020, Brittlestar, the stage name of comedian and video creator Stewart Reynolds, released “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok_maJ04SS0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Moving Target</a>,” a music video set to ’80s-style synths and drum machines that laments the loss of the chain. It references the dazzle and disappointment of Target: “You and your American smile / Designed to drive me wild / I should’ve known you’d break my heart / And leave me alone with Walmart.” Given Zellers’ reputation as a relatively stable place to work, the company stands in contrast to the guilt some Canadians may feel shopping with other purveyors of cheap goods, such as Amazon and Walmart, that have much less stability and employ gig-based workers. In her eulogy, Hannah Brunn tracks this feeling: “Zellers’ simplicity was welcoming in light of our latest relationship&mdash;our dependency rather, is more like it&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;the situation we’ve found ourselves in is as scary as it is exciting. Amazon has taken over our lives, collecting those ‘mom and pop’ stores like trophies, shoving department stores into their unmarked graves.” This fear may explain the fervour of Zellers nostalgia: an anxiety about the brute force of large multinationals; a longing for a simpler time, brought on by the explosion of nostalgia-driven online content, mingled with real financial concerns; and an urge to latch on to a unifying symbol of Canadianness amid all these shakeups.</p>
<p>Can a Zellers revival solve any of these anxieties? Can the brand even stay afloat as a subsidiary of the Bay? Jacobson says bringing back Zellers will be a challenge “as there are competitors that provide bargains, such as Amazon, Walmart, Dollarama, or even second-hand marketplaces on social media, like Facebook Marketplace.” Other business experts have noted that the Bay may be bringing back the brand in part because, in late 2020, it let its trademark of Zellers lapse. According to <em><a href="https://retail-insider.com/retail-insider/2021/10/quebec-family-nabs-zellers-trademark-from-hbc-to-open-small-format-zellers-stores-and-restaurants/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Retail Insider</a></em>, a Quebec family bought it with plans to open small Zellers storefronts and restaurants; the Bay’s 2023 refresh of Zellers is seen as an attempt to wrest back control of the brand.</p>
<p>In early 2023, HBC <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/the-countdown-is-on-set-to-open-this-spring-zellers-unveils-the-first-25-locations-for-its-store-experience-inside-hudson-s-bay-stores-810846318.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced more details</a>. Each new Zellers that will open within an existing Bay store will be roughly 8,000–10,000 square feet in size, depending on the location. The online site will launch in tandem with the opening of the physical spaces, and the family restaurants will be revived as food trucks. It appears Zellers will be returning as a shadow of its former self. Those massive stores of old&mdash;beloved as places where grandmothers shopped and friends met at diner tables&mdash;will still be empty.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/zellers-nostalgia/">Zellers Is Back.

<p>Early spring thaws had begun to melt the snow that blanketed my small town in southern Ontario, allowing all the detritus of winter to slowly come free. Jace&mdash;a cross between standard poodle and Australian Shepherd&mdash;was excited by the new sights, new smells. But especially by the garbage. Entranced by all the paper and plastic and indeterminate mounds that typically emerge from former snow banks, he seemed to have decided early on that each of the items was a toy carefully set aside for his enjoyment. </p>

<p>It happened faster than I could react. He spied a particularly appetizing, child-sized sock, left for some reason on the grass by the side of the park. It was in his mouth in seconds. I realized I was doomed before I could even close the gap between us, tugging as hard as I could on the leash. Jace, not yet fully trained, had not broken the habit of resource guarding anything he could fit in his jaw (and many things he could not). He made a low growl in the back of his throat and, as I contemplated a bloody battle over the fabric, did something I didn’t expect. He cocked his head back, eyes gleaming with puppy triumph, and swallowed.</p>
<p>It was a Saturday afternoon, so our local, small-town vet wasn’t open. It took me a little under an hour to call the closest after-hours clinic, shove the dog in the back seat, and drive to a neighbouring city. They saw him right away, which was lucky, because it meant the emergency care clinic could induce vomiting. He threw up the sock, and after I waited in the car for some monitoring, we headed home in short order. The vet’s bill for that evening’s walk? Two hundred and eighty-seven dollars.</p>

<p>It could have been a lot worse, as anyone with a dog will know. But the whole thing did make me wonder if I myself had been the one to bite off more than I could chew. I’d always loved dogs but never considered how much effort went into taking care of them, and once the hard realities began to set in, I asked myself more and more often why exactly we’d signed up for this. Dogs, I was beginning to learn, love unconditionally. As long as you meet their conditions. And my memory of those first months is a blurry montage of gnashing teeth and playful barks and an endless, inexhaustible drive to run.</p>
<p>My wife and I are far from alone in bringing a new pet into our lives during the chaos of the pandemic. An <a href="https://abacusdata.ca/pets-pandemic-canada/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Abacus Data study</a> in June 2021 estimated that 3 percent of Canadians&mdash;or about 900,000 people&mdash;became first-time pet owners between the start of the pandemic and June 2021, while a <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/national-survey-of-canadian-pet-owners-reveals-an-estimated-3-million-pets-joined-canadian-homes-during-the-pandemic-889445509.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">national study by Pet Valu,</a> published in February 2022, estimated 3 million pets had joined Canadian homes since COVID-19 hit. And while now, more than a year later, I’ve come to realize I don’t regret our decision to get a dog, not all new pet owners arrived at the same conclusion. Humane societies and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCAs), drained of dogs during the peak of the pandemic by the massive demand for adoption, are full to bursting after many families, overwhelmed or facing financial pressures, subsequently surrendered their pets. Supply chain issues have caused pet food shortages and rising costs across Canada and the US, while the veterinary industry’s looming labour crisis has finally come to an acute head. There’s no question that the pandemic changed the already booming pet industry, but can the systems that support it handle the load?</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smallcaps"> y many estimates, </span> my generation is now the most dog-obsessed cohort on earth. Recent numbers see millennials outstripping even the baby boomers in pet ownership. For some, this might be because having a pet is less expensive than having children. For years, some young people&mdash;burdened by a lack of finances compared to previous generations, or perhaps just more inclined to own pets&mdash;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erinlowry/2016/08/31/why-are-so-many-millennials-opting-for-pets-not-parenthood/?sh=3b444c433963" rel="noopener" target="_blank">have been happy with that arrangement</a>. It’s also true that record-low interest rates during the pandemic kept borrowing costs down, which made the cost of a pet more palatable to some fence-sitting households. But the most obvious factor is easy to understand: pets are the antithesis of loneliness, and many people turned to dog ownership at a time marked by that feeling. </p>
<p>For some, that’s been an opportunity. Hani Auran, who co-founded <a href="https://woofpacks.ca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Woof Pack</a>&mdash;a subscription box service for dogs&mdash;in 2017, saw his business more than double from around 8,000 subscribers in its first year to more than 20,000 today. In January 2021, he, alongside his business partner, launched a line of toys, producing more elaborately themed boxes for a market flooded with new pet owners. My wife and I have been subscribers for months, and our dog has received monthly packages for “Dogsgiving” and arcade night, complete with a plastic “wooftendo” chew toy shaped vaguely like the iconic, three-pronged N64 controllers of my own childhood. And yes, it has occurred to us that our dog is spoiled.</p>
<p>Woof Pack is only a part of a wave of boutique pet businesses that target the droves of new owners eager to ensure their own pets are doted upon equally. Dog owners of today can purchase everything from <a href="https://www.sparkpaws.ca/collections/dog-apparel" rel="noopener" target="_blank">apparel for their pets</a> to <a href="https://crownandpaw.ca/products/the-admiral-custom-pet-canvas" rel="noopener" target="_blank">elaborate, custom portraits</a>. Larger retailers have seen similar growth. Pet Valu, which has over 700 stores today, added around eighty since the start of 2020, plus an additional sixty-six with its acquisition of Chico, Quebec’s largest pet specialty franchise, in February 2022. Its second quarter earnings report in 2022 stated that system-wide sales had increased by 75 percent since 2019.</p>
<p>But despite soaring revenues for pet businesses, it’s become more expensive to own a pet. And that cost is a rising concern in an unstable economy. Supply chain issues during the pandemic saw the price of pet food spike as ingredients became more costly. In June 2021, the US-based PetFood Institute reported an estimated increase of between 8 and 20 percent in the cost across all ingredients, a problem which continued into 2022. My own dog food bill often exceeds $100 a month&mdash;far higher than what we’d expected. And though we’re fortunate to be in a position to afford it, not every family is as lucky. Some humane societies and other bodies have begun to organize more pet food banks, which proliferated during the pandemic. Add the cost of vet care or training into the equation and the math is simple: dogs are expensive. And it’s an expense that not every household can continue to afford.</p>
<p>Last May, the Kingston Humane Society <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/dog-surrenders-increase-rescues-pandemic-1.6451573" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported a record number of dogs</a> in its care, with sixty-two in the shelter and over 100 in foster care. Calgary has also seen a spike in calls to surrender dogs. In PEI, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-humane-society-surrenders-1.6651136" rel="noopener" target="_blank">where many residents</a> have struggled to find affordable, pet-friendly housing, humane societies have set grim records for the number of animals surrendered. And while the intake/outcome data at humane societies across the country remained largely static throughout much of 2022, the length of the animals’ stays has increased. There are many factors contributing to this, according to Barbara Cartwright, the CEO of Humane Canada, an organization that represents fifty-five humane societies and SPCAs across the country, but she points out that one of the largest has been puppy mills. The pandemic pet boom also saw an increase in less reputable pet breeding, and many animals being surrendered today struggle with health or behavioural issues that stem from poor conditions in these mills. This can prolong the time a dog spends in a shelter before it’s ready to be adopted.</p>
<p>But perhaps the greatest challenge, affecting both pet owners and shelters alike, is access to veterinary care. Last June, the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association (CVMA), an organization that works with vets across Canada, hosted a congress to address the national workforce shortage. According to Louis Kwantes, former president of the CVMA, this shortage poses a critical problem for the profession.</p>
<p>There were concerns even prior to the pandemic. In 2019, the CVMA commissioned a national workforce study and found that, given projected rises in pet (especially dog) ownership and a roughly 3 percent annual attrition rate, the veterinary industry would need to increase its workforce by about 3.5 to 4 percent per year in order to keep up&mdash;a pace that has only been accelerated by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Many vets who were approaching retirement age chose to retire early during the pandemic, putting the extra pressures of doing the job in the COVID era&mdash;from curbside care to personal health risks&mdash;on younger vets trying to remain in the industry. As a result, the mental health of staff, Kwantes says, has also become a major concern. </p>
<p>This workforce shortage hasn’t affected everyone evenly. Rural areas have traditionally attracted fewer vets than urban ones, and in some parts of eastern Canada, for example, you might have to drive for hours to get emergency care for your animal. Small animal clinics across the country have had to shut down emergency services temporarily because of staffing issues, and Kwantes says he’s aware of at least one emergency clinic having to close for a period of time. And while many of us may be able to overlook these problems, “if it’s your pet that needs emergency care, and you can’t get it, that’s huge,” he says.</p>
<p>The shortage means that some pet owners are more likely to be referred to costly after-hours clinics, like I was when my dog swallowed that sock. And it will likely result in rising costs across the board, putting further financial pressure on some families and already struggling shelters.</p>
<p>Some solutions are in the works. In April 2022, the BC provincial government <a href="https://spca.bc.ca/news/action-veterinarian-shortage-b-c/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">committed to doubling the number of subsidized seats</a> at the Western College of Veterinary Medicine, from twenty to forty, with an investment of over $10 million. Meanwhile, some humane societies and SPCAs are working to provide resources, from education to pet food banks, to their communities in an effort to keep pets with their families.</p>
<p>And though it has been met with some controversy, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has banned importing dogs from around 100 countries with a high risk of rabies. International dogs entering the country at a slower pace could relieve some of the pressure on both vets and humane societies&mdash;though, of course, there are many ways for prospective owners to acquire dogs domestically.</p>
<p>But with the early days of the pandemic behind us&mdash;along with the outpouring of initial support for shelters&mdash;Cartwright notes that now, more than ever, they need help to maintain the social safety net that has until recently remained in place.</p>
<p>For so many of us, pets fill in the gaps when our worlds seem to crack and splinter. We yearn for companionship and, sometimes, for something soft and warm to cuddle. But that crucial role in our lives doesn’t always come easily. For me, it meant an expense of time and energy as a tireless puppy ruled my life. Yet others sacrifice a lot more to make sure anyone who wants it can experience having a pet and that their new companions are cared for.</p>
<p>Today, the systems that have held up Canadian pet owners and their animals are stretched to the breaking point. And if things don’t change, that same salve for society’s ills may be unavailable to many households in the future. When we most needed them, in the darkest days of the pandemic, dogs were there for us. Now, the simple truth is that they need us too.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/more-dogs-than-ever/">We Own More Dogs than Ever Before.

Eaton’s was the store my grandmother frequented, checking for bargains in its basement every week, eating lunch in the sedate Grill Room. The Bay was vaguely hipper. I remember it still had elevator operators then as well as its own library and post office, though the in-house orchestra was gone. Both stores had a kind of majesty to them, unaware they had peaked as retail ideas.</p>
<p>The decline of the downtown Winnipeg Bay store resembled Hemingway’s description of bankruptcy&mdash;gradual, then sudden. It was the company’s national flagship store until 1974, but with the advent of malls in that decade, it began to lose its currency. By 2019, the downtown core of Winnipeg had largely hollowed out, and some of the Bay floors were closing. What remained felt like a dismal Soviet-era shopping experience under gloomy lights. The store was built in 1926 at a cost of around $5 million; at the time of its closing, in November 2020, Cushman &#038; Wakefield, a commercial real estate firm, valued the building at $0.</p>

</ul>
<p>In April 2022, the Hudson’s Bay Company announced it was gifting the iconic Winnipeg store to the Southern Chiefs’ Organization, an alliance of southern First Nations communities in Manitoba. This gift was in fact a trade&mdash;two beaver pelts and two elk skins for the more than 500,000 square-foot building, a reflection of the original 1670 Hudson’s Bay Company charter, which promised to pay rent of two beaver pelts and two elk skins to British monarchs whenever they entered the territory.</p>
<p>Richard Baker, HBC’s current governor and chairman, acknowledged the company’s complex heritage. “HBC’s Truth and Reconciliation journey requires actions that demonstrate our commitment to moving forward together with Indigenous communities,” he said in an HBC press release. The elegant beaux-arts building will be converted to a multiuse facility that includes housing, restaurants, a museum, and child care. </p>
<p>Once a network of ninety-two stores across the country, HBC’s footprint has shrunk. Other Bay stores have also closed, and a legacy location in Calgary is reducing the retail component in its building. HBC, which was hit hard by COVID-19 lockdowns, is a company in transition. “We’re not a department store chain,” Baker said in a <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-as-pandemic-hobbles-retailers-hbc-fights-department-store-headwinds/">2020 interview with the <em>Globe and Mail</em></a>. “We’re a holding company that owns many billions of dollars of real estate.” Millions of Canadians grew up with the Hudson’s Bay Company as a place to buy towels and clothes, but land has always been at the heart of HBC. Canada’s oldest company began as a land deal (at least from the European perspective) during an outbreak of the bubonic plague and may end as a real estate deal in another plague. </p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he company’s roots</span> can be traced back to 1665, the year Pierre-Esprit Radisson and his brother-in-law, Médard Chouart, Sieur des Groseilliers, journeyed to London, UK, seeking royal backing for their fur-trading enterprise in North America. This was the year of the bubonic plague in London, where up to 100,000 people&mdash;a fifth of the city’s population&mdash;died. King Charles II had moved his court to Oxford, and Radisson and des Groseilliers drifted through London on the Thames River, past the stench of rotting bodies. Public gatherings had been banned, theatres closed, almost all economic activity had ceased, and quarantine orders were in place. The two adventurers got an audience with Charles, who liked the idea of a fur-trading enterprise. He hoped their work would bring in money to help his decimated city. In 1670, Charles granted the charter that started the Hudson’s Bay Company, but the ownership of the land was largely an abstraction. He had no idea of its size and viewed it as a commodity.  </p>
<p>In his 1974 book, <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-fourth-world"><em>The Fourth World: An Indian Reality</em></a>, Shuswap political activist George Manuel wrote that the fundamental, irreconcilable difference between Europeans and Indigenous peoples was their “ideas of land.” The European idea was that man hovered above the land, with licence to claim and sell it, while the Indigenous idea was one of kinship&mdash;man was part of the land. The imbalance of power meant that the colonizer’s mercantile philosophies, as opposed to the spiritual philosophies of the colonized, were imposed on the land and became the foundation for many modern ills.  </p>
<p>As more traders arrived, the land slowly drifted toward real estate, punctuated by the earl of Selkirk’s purchase of more than 300,000 square kilometres of land from HBC. Selkirk’s settlement housed displaced Scottish and Irish people. He paid ten shillings for the land in 1811, a deal that included the present-day site of Winnipeg as well as its “customs, profits, commodities, emoluments, benefits, and advantages,” according to an agreement between Selkirk and the Hudson’s Bay Company. This was done without consultation with the First Nations and Métis living in the area.</p>
<p>In 1867, the Dominion of Canada was formed, but much of the west was still controlled by HBC. That year, the Americans bought Alaska from the Russians for $7.2 million (US) and were looking to buy more land. Prime minister John A. Macdonald could see the Americans were going to make HBC an offer, so he leaned on the British government, which leaned on the Hudson’s Bay Company, which reluctantly sold the land to Canada for a fraction of its market value. Rupert’s Land, as it was then called, was more than twice the size of Alaska, and was more habitable and richer in natural resources. In 1869, it went for the fire-sale price of $1.5 million, a dismal deal for both HBC and the Indigenous people who were the rightful owners of the land. HBC continued to control land around its trading posts, including some surrounding Winnipeg. From the European perspective, the land had officially become real estate.</p>
<p>Through the first 200 years of its existence, HBC’s governors, beginning with Prince Rupert of the Rhine (Charles II’s cousin), were situated a world away, with no first-hand knowledge of the fur trade or the territory. HBC thrived as a monopoly, but in <em>An Account of Six Years Residence in Hudson’s Bay: From 1733 to 1736 and 1744 to 1747</em>, author Joseph Robson accused the company of having “for eighty years slept at the edge of the frozen sea, they have shown no curiosity to penetrate farther themselves, and have exerted all their art and power to crush that spirit in others.” This allowed rival North West Company, established in 1779, to gain footing in the fur trade despite its inferior supply lines.</p>
<p>The current governor of HBC, Richard Baker, is a New York real estate investor who has also been accused of being asleep by the frozen sea—at least when it came to the retail aspect of the business. Baker had limited retail experience when he bought HBC in 2008. In 2012, he took the company public and acquired the upscale department store Saks for $2.9 billion (US), with plans to expand the US luxury chain into Canada. The expansion involved vertically separating the Bay’s downtown Toronto flagship into two “half” stores, a Hudson’s Bay and a Saks. Other retail ventures were sold: Lord &#038; Taylor (which Baker already owned) and European businesses, including the department store chain Galeria Kaufhof. According to HBC fiscal reports, sales in 2016 totalled $14.5 billion; two years later, they stood at $9.4 billion. Baker faced criticism for HBC stock dropping in value and for not better utilizing its real estate. </p>
<p>In March 2020, when COVID-19 was starting to spread through the world, Baker won his bid to take the company private once more, with support from a consortium of shareholders, including, at one point, WeWork (a co­working space company) and private-equity Rhone Capital LLC, <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-wework-woes-shareholder-anger-complicate-hbc-plans-to-privatize/">according to the <em>Globe and Mail</em></a>. By this point, department stores were viewed as anachronisms. In Canada, the last of the big homegrown department stores (Simpson’s, Eaton’s, Sears, and Zellers) were all gone. In the US, Macy’s was closing stores; Neiman Marcus, Barneys, JCPenney had all filed for bankruptcy; and Lord &#038; Taylor was liquidating its stores in preparation for bankruptcy. As retail analyst Eric Matusiak <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-as-pandemic-hobbles-retailers-hbc-fights-department-store-headwinds/">told the <em>Globe and Mail</em></a>, department stores were already “dinosaurs that were dying out,” and COVID-19 was simply the asteroid that would finish them off. HBC sales had plummeted, but as Baker said, they weren’t a department store chain—they were a real estate company. </p>
<p>Baker had already sold some valuable HBC properties. In 2014, he sold the iconic Bay store in Toronto, at the corner of Queen and Yonge Streets, to developer Cadillac Fairview for $650 million, then rented the space for the Bay and Saks stores. In 2017, he sold the Lord &#038; Taylor Fifth Avenue store in New York for $850 million (US). In Canada, HBC owns or ground leases (ground leases are long leases of fifty to 100 years) fourteen of its eighty-six stores. The rest operate on shorter leases, many of them in malls. In the US, HBC owns or ground leases fifty-eight retail properties, either solely or in partnership with others. </p>
<p>If HBC is a real estate company, what is that real estate worth? In June 2020, the <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-hbc-expected-to-sell-up-to-us900-million-in-bonds-as-coronavirus/"><em>Globe and Mail</eM> reported </a>that CBRE, a commercial real estate company, had valued HBC’s stores at $5.1 billion (US), with $3.5 billion in mortgages. But the value of real estate is tied to its use. Retail was already going through a transformation before COVID-19, an online shopping–driven trend that has accelerated in the past two years and ­affected the value of retail buildings. In 2014, the Saks Fifth Avenue store was valued at $3.7 billion (US); five years later, it was valued at $1.6 billion (US). The $2.1 billion discount, HBC told <em>Bloomberg</em> in 2019, was due in part to changes in market rents and the retail landscape, among other things. And the building’s landmark status limits possible renovations and hampers redevelopment. Even without a heritage designation, remodelling HBC’s other elegant legacy stores, including Bay stores in Vancouver and Montreal, has proven to be a massive&mdash;and expensive&mdash;undertaking. And the Winnipeg HBC store is the poster child for this paradox, its value pegged at zero. A decade before it was given to the Southern Chiefs’ Organization, the store was offered to the University of Winnipeg for free, though the institution turned it down because it couldn’t afford the “acquisition, redevelopment, and operation” of the building. (In its 2019 appraisal, Cushman &#038; Wakefield estimated that it would take $111 million just to bring it up to code.)</p>
<p>Saks has teamed up with WeWork to provide office space in the flagship Fifth Avenue building, and there are ambitious plans to expand both the Vancouver and Montreal Saks stores into multiuse facilities that will include office towers. But the office vacancy rate in Montreal was 16.5 percent in 2021, a record. In 2021, New York was at 18.3 percent, the highest in thirty years. Vancouver alone has escaped the carnage, with a relatively modest vacancy rate of 7.2 percent. <em>Forbes</em> questioned “whether offering ­office space in what is one of the worst commercial real estate markets in recent U.S. history is the best use of that space.”</p>
<p>What is the value of commercial real estate in a post-COVID world, should there be one? There may not be a fast recovery in the office market. Many companies are moving to a hybrid model and, as a result, don’t need as much office space. There is a flight to quality in some major cities, where space in new, technologically sophisticated buildings is still prized, and this trend would benefit HBC’s plans for office towers in Montreal and Vancouver that cater to tech-sector tenants.</p>
<p>When it was given to the Southern Chiefs’ Organization in the spring of 2022, the downtown Winnipeg store was essentially derelict. The store is a heritage building, making it very difficult to raze and meaning the facade must remain intact. There is asbestos embedded in the floors&mdash;a complicated, expensive fix. The estimated $130 million renovation will create a museum, living space, and restaurants&mdash;including an atrium featuring skylights to bring in more natural light&mdash;partly funded by the federal and provincial governments. Baker  opposed the heritage designation when it arrived in 2019 as it makes the building more difficult to develop, and that year, he was saddled with a $302,298 (<a href="https://winnipeg.ctvnews.ca/less-than-worthless-real-estate-appraisal-deems-winnipeg-hbc-building-worth-0-1.4696818?cache=aytavhhzp">according to CTV News</a>) property tax bill for a building that wasn’t producing revenue. It was a costly asset, and passing it on to the Southern Chiefs’ Organization provided HBC with some financial relief as well as valuable PR. The prime minister himself spoke at the handover ceremony in Winnipeg on April 22, calling it “an inspired act of reclamation.” But, as a symbol of economic reconciliation, the Winnipeg store is a complicated gift and has been termed a “regifting”&mdash;essentially a royal fruitcake making the rounds over the centuries.</p>
<p>The project was publicly welcomed by the Southern Chiefs’ Organization. The working title is “Wehwehneh Bahgahkinahgohn,” Anishinaabemowin for “it is visible.” It is a beautiful building and a great architectural opportunity to do something extraordinary on a high-profile site. Some see it as a way to preserve the architectural heritage and the beginning of an optimistic ­chapter in Canada–Indigenous relations. But an episode of <em>Media Indigena</em>, a podcast broadcast from Winnipeg by journalist Rick Harp, titled “<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/looking-hbcs-ill-gotten-gift-horse-in-the-mouth/id1092220986?i=1000559419096">Looking HBC’s ill-gotten gift horse in the mouth</a>,” offered another perspective. A guest, Kenneth Williams, an assistant professor with the University of Alberta’s department of drama, suggested that, as reparations, it wasn’t enough. HBC exploited Indigenous people for centuries (it didn’t get out of the fur trade until the 1990s), with trappers, some of whom were Indigenous, making as little as $280 a year in the 1950s&mdash;less than the markup on most fur coats at the time. And the Winnipeg store was ground zero for this trade, with the largest fur storage facility in western Canada, a vault that could hold 12,000 furs. Williams suggested “the inspired act of reclamation” was merely HBC getting rid of a toxic asset.</p>
<p>The transfer of the Winnipeg store feels like another link removed from a gradually diminishing chain. In 2021, Baker spun off the e-commerce arms of Saks Fifth Avenue and its discount cousin Saks Off 5th as separate entities, with a venture capital firm, Insight Partners, investing $500 million in the e-commerce operation. This, too, was viewed by some as a real estate play.</p>
<p>“I believe this Saks split-up veils the true Baker strategy of unlocking value by somehow linking it all to real estate deals,” wrote Robin Lewis, a former vice president at Goldman Sachs, in his blog. </p>
<p>The splitting of the entities was seen by industry observers as counter­intuitive at a time when most retailers were aiming for seamless integration of their online and brick-and-mortar operations. Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia University and a former CEO of Sears Canada, saw it as a thinly veiled strategy to strip the assets of HBC so only the real estate remained. “It’s a ­financial play,” he said, “which gives him the ability to manipulate the real estate assets of Hudson’s Bay, both in Canada and the US. They’ve come up with all sorts of gobbledygook about how well it’s working. This is going to be a disaster at some point, but at the end of the day, it created a bundle of cash for Baker.”</p>
<p>It’s possible the HBC stores many of us grew up with, in those beautiful heritage buildings, will all disappear quietly. “Baker will liquidate the Bay,” Cohen predicted. “He will liquidate.” If he does&mdash;its Bay Days sales and Stanfield underwear finally gone&mdash;all that will be left will be the land. Currently, it is controlled by deeds, leaseholds, and leases that are shared by Baker, venture capitalists, equity partners, and, now, Indigenous nations&mdash;its use in flux, the buildings both protected and vulnerable. This version of the land echoes that of the seventeenth century: its ownership shared, complex, somewhat ethereal, and profiting someone in another country as a plague winds down.  </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/hudsons-bay-company/">Why Hudson’s Bay Company’s Future Is in Question</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

Depending on which of the retailer’s branches you enter, you might notice a giant bow-tie sculpture by Douglas Coupland (Squamish nation territory in British Columbia), a three-storey mural by Maya Gohill that stretches from the top to the bottom of your escalator ride (Calgary), or a green roof complete with beehives (Mississauga, Old Quebec, and Laval).</p>
<p>These curated shopping spaces are a far cry from what some consumers might associate with department stores: dim lights, overcrowded clothing rails, and sales associates that are nowhere to be found. For many Canadians, the first department store that jumps to mind is Hudson’s Bay. The once-massive empire is now a shell of its former self, with the company shutting down four of its stores in the past two years, including locations in Edmonton, Winnipeg, and Dorval, Quebec. Other large stores in Canada, like Sears and Eaton’s, have succumbed to what writers and analysts have called the “<a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/21717536/department-store-middle-class-amazon-online-shopping-covid-19" rel="noopener" target="_blank">death of the department store</a>.” Meanwhile, across the border, Lord &#038; Taylor and Neiman Marcus have reshaped the way they operate following bankruptcy filings. It’s not hard to see why: the brick-and-mortar landscape was struggling even before the <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, and Amazon and other online sellers have only made buying online more appealing in the past few years. </p>
<p>And yet Simons seems to have avoided most of this. In the past five years, the Quebec-based retailer has opened three new stores and a major distribution centre. The company plans to open its first Atlantic location, in Halifax, by early 2024. Simons isn’t technically a department store&mdash;it offers <em>most</em> departments (including clothing, accessories, and homeware) though not all the ones needed to earn the title and currently has only sixteen stores across the country&mdash;but retail analyst Craig Patterson suggests it’s certainly able to compete with its peers in the space. What’s more surprising, however, is how a large retailer like Simons has been able to remain relevant. As analysts predict the downfall of the department store, has the Canadian retailer managed to figure out the formula to not just stay afloat but actually succeed and expand?</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="smallcaps">imons has been</span> around since 1840, when it was originally founded as a dry goods shop in Quebec City by John Simons. John was said to have made seventy-two trips across the Atlantic to get a hold of Scottish and Irish linen and knitwear. It was only in the 1960s that the family-owned business began creating in-house brands, most notably Twik, which was inspired by the English fashion icon Twiggy, and is still manufactured and marketed to youth today.</p>
<p>When Peter Simons, the former owner and CEO of La Maison Simons, took the reins of the company from his father, Donald Gordon Simons, in the mid-1990s, his goal was simple. “I was trying to create a unique product and service offerings for our customers. And to do that in the last two decades, although I don’t believe in scale, I felt that we needed to be a little bit bigger in order to tap into a huge creative ecosystem,” he says. Unlike other retailers in its category, Simons’s ethos was never to become a mammoth but rather to take a steadier route. Opening one store at a time is less risky and more achievable at the company’s current size. </p>
<p>Simons’s more recent openings include locations in Quebec City in 2018, Calgary and Edmonton in 2017, Ottawa and Mississauga in 2016, and another Montreal store in 2021. If it feels like something is missing here, you’re right. Despite having two spaces in Ontario, Simons has yet to make a place for itself in what is arguably the largest economic hub in the country: Toronto.  </p>
<p>The company is scouting for spots in Toronto and Vancouver. (It was reported in 2015 that Simons was en route to joining either Scarborough Town Centre or Yorkdale, but neither came to fruition.) Patterson suspects the delay was caused by Nordstrom scooping up so many potential anchor locations shortly after Sears closed down. (The retailer currently has thirteen locations across Canada.) The other reason, of course, is that Simons is a family-owned business: there is only so much money such a company can dole out at a time.</p>
<p>Despite its limited locations, Simons understands how to make its environments feel current. Other large retailers have not kept up with that approach, at least not outside of their flagship stores. The most recent revamp of a Hudson’s Bay location would have been two years ago: the makeover of the Room, its luxury department, in downtown Vancouver. The flagship location, on Queen Street in Toronto, saw ongoing expansion and renovation in the ’70s, 2000s, and 2010s. Other than that, though, many of its nonflagship branches struggle to stay above water, with some spaces that feel outdated and get little attention. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">P</span><span class="smallcaps">erhaps, Simons understands</span> how to make in-person shopping more enjoyable. Rahul Mehta, a customer who often shops at the Square One location in Mississauga, says the design of the building itself makes him want to stick around in the shop a little longer. “There’s a bit of a small plaza, there’s bike parking, which is actually maintained, there’s a generous sidewalk, and there’s a sense that you can dwell in the space outside the building without having to spend anything&mdash;that is massively important to me.” Though Simons didn’t directly contribute to the development of the plaza, it did aim to support it architecturally. The white concrete, for example, was chosen to bring and reflect light into the space. Both Square One and Simons received a Healthy by Design award from the city of Mississauga for elements like service proximity, land-use mix, and street connectivity.</p>
<p>The thing about the department store is that its branding has always been tied to experience. Think of Hudson’s Bay’s Christmas windows, Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, or the Santa Claus parades Eaton’s held while clinging on to its last loyal customers before bankruptcy. The idea isn’t new, but Simons has championed it by doing it in reverse&mdash;come for the clothes and stay for the art. And, as e-commerce models become more popular with consumers, the need for an inviting space is more important than ever.</p>
<p>“Retailers are recognizing that it needs to be more than just displaying clothing or merchandise,” says Jenna Jacobson, an assistant professor at Toronto Metropolitan University’s Ted Rogers School of Management. “If the in-store experience [is] to compel people to come back into the store, to shop in the store, [customers are] going to want something more.” In that sense, she explains, the in-store shopping experience becomes a brand-building opportunity, with customers going in to reignite their connection with a specific brand. One way to do this is through “omni channelling,” a business strategy to have multiple “touchpoints” for transactions (website, brick-and-mortar store, marketplace, restaurant, or cafe). </p>
<p>For Simons, that value comes from the art and architecture of the space. Other successful examples include Aritzia’s A-OK Cafe on Bloor Street in Toronto, says Jacobson. According to an article from consulting firm McKinsey &#038; Company, real estate developers are working on having more restaurants within retail areas to appeal to millennial consumers, in keeping with the idea of creating “stop spots” for consumers. The taglines for the Aritzia cafe are “If you like your coffee with a side of shopping, come hang out” and “Don’t let snack-free shopping happen to you.” </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t seems that</span> what Simons lacks in locations, it makes up for with strong e-commerce. Wow Digital named it the best online customer experience in Canada in 2019 and 2020, and in 2021, it ranked in the top three, according to a survey of 14,000 participants conducted by the same company. The survey ranked the company’s app first, a win based on its “visual appeal, the personalization of the customer experience and the presence of interesting additional content.” </p>
<p>And some customers say the experience of shopping online feels similar to that of shopping in store. “I like that basically everything you see online is [the same] in person. Some stores feel like it’s two different stores that you’re shopping at,” says Nicole Mensah, a twenty-one-year-old student from Brampton, Ontario. She also appreciates the speedy shipping, something not all customers have been lucky enough to have due to supply-chain disruptions. </p>
<p>Simons opened a $300 million distribution centre in 2020, and the aim is to have it automated in the near future, with a robotics plan in the works already. According to data company PitchBook, Simons received a total of $215 million in funding for the centre, including $27 million from the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Quebec, $17 million from Investissement Quebec and an $81 million loan from the Government of Canada. Distribution centres are a key part of a business’s ability to fulfill customer orders. They serve as the bridge between suppliers and customers and allow companies to store, pick out, and pack their products, all in the same facility. Basically, it makes online shopping gets easier for everybody, and you get your package quicker. “In terms of e-commerce [and their] app, and everything that Simons has done, the retailer really is looking to the future and how consumers are going to be shopping online,” Patterson says.      </p>
<p>Another plus of the website that seems to be hitting a home run with customers is the appearance of commitment to sustainability and ethics. “For any department store I want to shop at, I’m looking for their sustainability strategy,” says Mehta. “I’m looking [to see if] they highlight and support small businesses, especially small Canadian businesses, and it’s front and centre on the Simons homepage, which is really cool.” </p>
<p>While that’s a clear motivation for shoppers, greenwashing in the fashion industry has become paramount. A report by the Changing Markets Foundation found that 39 percent of the products it assessed (across brands like ASOS, Gucci, and Zara) came with sustainability-related tags such as “eco” or “recycled,” and more than half of those products failed to meet the UK Competition and Markets Authority’s guidelines on avoiding greenwashing.</p>
<p>Good on You, a website and app that grades brands on their environmental and social performance, says that Simons “does not communicate sufficient information about its labour policies” and points out that it does not provide any evidence for minimizing packaging and use of hazardous chemicals or for water reductions. So, while the brand isn’t exactly the most environmentally friendly, its “homegrown” branding seems to be working with customers.</p>
<p>That emphasis on Canada first&mdash;Canadian made, Canadian brands, Canadian owned, and Canadian art&mdash;is somewhat rare. Titans like HBC and Nordstrom may dominate the playing field when it comes to being a household name, but they’re owned by international stakeholders. Somewhat unbeknownst to many, the Bay has been owned by a Bermuda holding company for almost three years now. Nordstrom is just its American implant competitor. One could argue that Holt Renfrew holds strong as a Canadian-owned business, but its offerings are simply out of reach for most Canadians. What Simons offers consumers is a chance at identity that the others don’t. </p>
<p>The domestic desire to shop Canadian is real. According to a survey by the Business Development Bank of Canada, 45 percent of participants had made “a specific effort to buy Canadian in recent months.” On top of that, another 24 percent made an effort to buy products specifically made in their province. The pandemic made that desire even stronger. In 2021, Interac released a survey revealing that 75 percent of Canadians said the pandemic made “shopping and supporting businesses in their community more important.” The same survey said that 55 percent of Canadians claimed their desire to support local businesses led them to “shift their spending by shopping closer to home.”</p>
<p>The approach has been important in capturing a young demographic of shoppers. Generation Z&mdash;customers around Mensah’s age&mdash;tends to be a socially conscious group of shoppers. According to a recent study, from First Insight, most Gen Z shoppers prefer to buy sustainable brands and are even willing to spend 10 percent more for sustainable products.</p>
<p>Peter Simons stepped down from his role this past March and is now the company’s chief merchant. He also continues to sit on Simons’s advisory board as well as family council. The new CEO, Bernard Leblanc, is the first person from outside the Simons family to run the company since its inception more than 100 years ago, though he’s been involved with the company since the mid-1990s. </p>
<p>He’s aware that there’s still work to be done in increasing its national footprint&mdash;and maybe one day even expanding it south of the border. But there’s “no rush to do so,” he said when we spoke in September. “We want to do things right rather than just push growth.” </p>
<p>He also added that the company has been investing in a national campaign for brand awareness and is excited for the Halifax opening in 2024 to complete Simons’s coast-to-coast presence. But the end goal remains the same: “Not to be the largest in the industry but potentially the most thoughtful.” </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/simons-shop/">Is Simons Canada’s Next Great Department Store?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

As many as six million customers across the country would receive one, according to a company estimate&mdash;a move that was expected to cost between $75 million and $150 million. This was seen as a PR scramble after the company admitted involvement in a bread price fixing scheme amid a Competition Bureau criminal probe into whether several large retailers and suppliers were coordinating to increase the price of bread. According to court documents unsealed in a class-action lawsuit, the bureau alleged that, along with grocery retailers including Sobeys and Metro and bread suppliers, Loblaw had artificially inflated the price of bread by at least $1.50 for over a decade. Each price hike would take the same pattern, which became known as the “7/10 convention”: the supplier would raise the price by 7 cents, and then the stores would raise it by 10 cents for the consumer. On and on until the price of bread was vastly inflated.</p>
<p>Immediately following the news of the bread price fixing, public trust in Loblaw plummeted 10 percent, CBC News reported. Today, the grocery industry is facing consumer frustration and concern, due in large part to newly increased prices at grocery stores. This past year, many Canadians have scrambled to adjust their grocery budgets because of rising inflation. According to Statistics Canada, in July, the price of eggs rose nearly 16 percent year over year, of fresh fruit by nearly 12 percent, and that of bakery products by over 13 percent.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://angusreid.org/inflation-bank-of-canada-grocery-prices/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">August 2022 Angus Reid poll</a> found that 78 percent of Canadians think grocery stores are taking advantage of current inflation to increase profits. A Dalhousie University study found that the three top grocers&mdash;Loblaw, Metro, and the Empire chain that owns Sobeys&mdash;all posted higher profits this year compared with their average performances over the past five years. While experts say there are a host of factors behind the price rises, including supply chain issues and increased transportation costs, the increasing profits of major grocers have sparked public outcry. Rising costs have even triggered a study by the Competition Bureau, which appears to be still investigating the bread price fixing scheme, to look into whether competition factors have impacted grocery bills as well.</p>
<p>Canadians don’t have a large array of choices when it comes to where they shop. According to some of the most recent data, available via the United States Department of Agriculture, five major retailers (Loblaw, Sobeys/Safeway, Walmart, Costco, and Metro) command nearly 80 percent of the grocery retail business in Canada. This market dominance gives them significant power over their relationships with both customers and suppliers. The shadow of the bread price fixing scandal, snarled supply chains amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and rising food prices have cast a pall over the grocery industry. Some have characterized it as an oligopoly, with a few big players dominating the market and creating conditions for possible price collusion. </p>
<p>Even before the inflation spike and inquiry, the federal government and industry members were looking into potential power imbalances. Retail experts say the key to increasing transparency for suppliers and consumers is a grocery code of conduct. It’s not a magic bullet by any means, but it could introduce more accountability in an industry that is essential for virtually all Canadians.  </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n late 2020</span>, the federal, provincial, and territorial ministers of agriculture and food created a working group to explore a code of conduct for the food industry; by the next year, industry groups and food and retail insiders were working together on a draft. The origins of the proposed code have a lot to do with the dynamics between major chains and their suppliers as well as suppliers and independent grocers. While a retailer can represent more than 20 percent of a single supplier’s volume, no single supplier represents more than 3 percent of a retailer’s volume, creating an imbalance of power, says Michael Graydon, CEO of the industry group <a href="https://www.fhcp.ca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Food, Health, and Consumer Products of Canada</a> (FHCP). One proposal, from the FHCP and Empire, suggested a common set of rules to promote fair dealing between retailers and suppliers through things like written supply arrangements and mechanisms for resolving disputes.</p>

</ul>
<p>Retailers can currently demand that suppliers pay to get their products on store shelves&mdash;and pay even more to have those products promoted in store flyers or shelved at eye level. Larger retailers will often also push some of their costs onto suppliers: for instance, by giving themselves deductions on already-sent invoices and using that money to fund their own e-commerce platforms. These deductions or price changes aren’t fully explained to many suppliers. Instead, the retailers simply tell them that these new prices are in place, and suppliers have little recourse if they want to continue getting their products on store shelves. Playing by the retailers’ rules can become very expensive very quickly. Oftentimes, suppliers have to raise the prices of their products to make their profit, and the consumer ends up footing the bill. </p>
<p>Last spring, Loblaw stores stopped stocking Frito-Lay’s potato chips because the retailer wouldn’t agree to price changes that the Frito-Lay company instituted. Some suggested it was an effort on Loblaw’s part to ensure its wholesale costs remained the same, leaving a major supplier to deal with dramatically rising prices. Others say it was actually an attempt to keep prices consistent for customers. It’s not clear how much money Frito-Lay, a subsidiary of the multinational PepsiCo, risked by standing its ground for over a month, but its chips were pulled from Loblaw, which, with its close to 2,500 stores across the country, represents a huge market share.     </p>
<p>Large retailers’ prices can indirectly affect independent stores too. Gary Sands, the senior vice president of the <a href="https://cfig.ca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Canadian Federation of Independent Grocers (CFIG)</a>, recalls that during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, independent retailers were struggling to stock items like eggs or hand sanitizers because suppliers were prioritizing the major stores. It’s in the best interest of those suppliers to keep the big grocery retailers happy as they make up a huge portion of their business. And, if suppliers, big or small, come up short in supplying these retailers, they might incur a financial penalty. </p>
<p>Sands, who is also a member of the industry steering committee working on the code, says the goal is to promote “fairness and transparency” in the grocery market. And, importantly, the industry wants to do it without government oversight. </p>
<p>But, having already failed to meet two previous deadlines, the industry committee, which includes lobby groups such as the Fruit and Vegetable Growers of Canada and the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, along with retail players, has until the end of November to submit a working draft of the code to the federal, territorial, and provincial agricultural ministers. Ultimately, if the industry committee fails in its task to finalize a proposal by the November deadline, the agricultural ministers will be forced to step in. If they do, government members will have an active role in the process and can ultimately bring about the one thing that Sands and others don’t want: government in the grocery aisles. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he Canadian Federation</span> of Independent Grocers has been pushing for a code of conduct since as far back as 2005. There are 6,900 independent grocers in Canada, and Sands says many of them serve rural, remote, and Indigenous communities. When they don’t have access to a fair supply of products, he’s seen concerns about food insecurity. Without a code of conduct, those retailers are at the mercy of suppliers, who are often at the mercy of large chain stores. A small rural grocer might not get its shipment of pasta one week if there’s a limited supply and the chain retailer in the next town upped its order. That was made clear this year, when the pandemic tightened supply chains, inflation skyrocketed, issues of fair supply were thrown into focus, and others, including government, says Sands, began “looking at the industry and realizing, <em>hey, we have an issue here</em>.”  </p>
<p>Sands says a strong code of conduct would promote fairness and competition, something that would filter down to the customer in the form of better pricing. There would also be an enforcement arm of the code, so if a grocer or supplier is found breaking any of the provisions, they would be fined or otherwise punished for their mistakes and held to account by their own industry, though those specifics are still being worked out.</p>
<p>Currently, there are few forms of recourse for retailers and suppliers who break the rules. A supplier or independent retailer could file a complaint with the federal government under the Competition Act, but the process is far from simple or straightforward. “It’s time consuming and expensive to lodge a complaint,” Sands says, “and by no means should you be assured that there’s going to be a successful resolution.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;It’s just not realistic.” </p>
<p>However, there is a sense of optimism about the code. Graydon says, “This will take time, so I anticipate there will be a transition period, but I am hopeful that&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;we have a smooth and effective implementation of the code.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="smallcaps">anada is joining</span> other countries that have or are considering codes of conduct. Graydon calls the existing code in the UK, first established in 2013, a “solid example of best practice.” The code outlines rules relating to supply agreements and payments as well as the costs of promoting products. The code in Australia has already undergone review in that country, which found that it’s improved relationships between retailers and suppliers in a short time. However, the review notes that there is more work to be done. As the code is voluntary, not all large retailers have signed on to participate. New Zealand is also currently working to institute one, though it’s not as far along in the process as Canada is.  </p>
<p>The actual specifics of a Canadian code of conduct are tough to pin down. The committee is still discussing issues like enforcement provisions. But, even once there’s consensus, would a code really work? When it comes to something like preventing a price fix, “you are likely to reduce the risk of collusion, because there will be more oversight,” predicts Sylvain Charlebois, director of the <a href="https://www.dal.ca/sites/agri-food.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Agri-Food Analytics Lab</a> at Dalhousie University. “But I think it’s practically impossible to eliminate all risk.” </p>
<p>Simon Somogyi, the Arrell Chair in the Business of Food at the University of Guelph, says any industry code will only be as good as the enforcement mechanisms. In Australia, for example, grocers who sign on to the code have to provide written contracts or agreements that relate to supply. These contracts spell out provisions such as what volume the retailers need for certain products and when they will turn to a second-tier supplier to supplement low deliveries. These relationships can be codified by the contract or supply agreements&mdash;but they also give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) guidelines to work with to enforce the code. Say, for instance, that a supplier delivers fresh oranges to a grocery store on Monday but the store rejects the delivery on Thursday. That would be a breach of the code, which requires a twenty-four-hour notice for rejecting a delivery. Now the commission has a clear directive to act.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to have a strong watchdog to make sure (the code) is enforced,” Somogyi says. “That enforcement body needs to have teeth and funding to do their job properly. And, by that, I mean: do they have jurisdiction? Do they have the ability to get people and investigate for fraud or breaches of the code?” A 2021 proposal for a code suggested retailers designate “Code Compliance Officers” to oversee compliance. The committee is tight lipped about the enforcement; it remains one of several provisions they are still discussing, though Graydon says there will be an adjudicator appointed with “authority to manage the code.” Without knowing who exactly would act as an enforcement body in Canada, or what the scope of their jurisdiction would be, it’s hard to see how effective a code might be. </p>
<p>Crucially, for Somogyi, the code must be something that all industry players are excited to sign on to, as they’ll ultimately be the ones holding each other accountable. Sobeys said in a statement that it expected a decision shortly. But, overall, the major retailers have offered few detailed comments about the code or what to expect. </p>
<p>A department spokesperson for the federal agriculture minister, Marie-Claude Bibeau, says the minister, along with her provincial counterparts, is monitoring the progress. As for what the role of government in such a code would be, the department demurred, saying that those specifics are still being discussed.</p>
<p>If the committee isn’t able to meet the deadline and government steps in, some experts worry it could lead to a patchwork approach of different codes across the provinces and territories. Some provinces, like Manitoba, have legislators calling for action, asking for a nonpartisan government committee to investigate rising food prices. Others may be more lax in their approaches, meaning that, if this code does end up in the hands of individual provinces and territories, consumers across the country may have different shopping experiences. For example, if one province enacts a code and another does not, a supplier would have two sets of regulations for the same product. That kind of variation is tricky for suppliers and retailers, and most hope to avoid too much government involvement. </p>
<p>But some experts are skeptical about the possibility of any other way forward. “At the end of the day, it’s hard to force the hand of very powerful companies like Walmart and Loblaw,” says Charlebois. “Loblaw can make or break companies. They can pick vendors they want to deal with and push away other vendors they don’t want to deal with.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;That’s why we’re even having a conversation about a code of conduct.” </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/grocer-code-of-conduct/">Rising Food Prices: Could a Grocer Code of Conduct Help?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

Donning white hard hats, a group of politicians, corporate officials, and Enoch Cree Nation leaders had gathered at a groundbreaking ceremony tied to the Trans Mountain expansion. Trans Mountain has been a linchpin of Canada’s <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/oil/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">oil</a> industry since it was built nearly seventy years ago, and its expansion on the First Nation’s land&mdash;a project that would extend the existing pipeline, for exports, from <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/alberta/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alberta</a> to the Port of Vancouver&mdash;would triple daily capacity to 890,000 barrels of oil.</p>
<p>Breaking ground would be the easy part. From the time it was proposed in 2013 by then owner Kinder Morgan, a Texas-based oil-and-gas corporation, the Trans Mountain expansion faced widespread resistance. First Nations like Tsleil-Waututh, located on BC’s coast, knew their territory would bear the brunt of increased tanker traffic. And, for citizens worried about the realities of climate change, building a lifeline for Canadian oil seemed a noxious mission. As opposition from First Nations, the BC government, municipalities, and environmentalists fuelled court cases, blockades, and rallies, Kinder Morgan’s shareholders grew uneasy. In August 2018, just a month after the Enoch Cree ceremony, the company withdrew from the project, selling its stake to the federal Liberal government for $4.5 billion. The purchase was temporary, the government said. It intended to find a new buyer.</p>

</ul>
<p>This year, the price tag for the expansion project jumped 70 percent to $21.4 billion after a series of events, including the pandemic and flooding along the pipeline route, drove up construction costs. While announcing the price increase at a press conference, deputy prime minister <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/chrystia-freeland/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chrystia Freeland</a> hinted at some form of Indigenous ownership. “We will announce the next step toward that important objective later this year,” she said. It seemed an idea whose time had come. After over a century of exclusion from the oil industry, Indigenous people would finally take the helm.</p>
<p>One person who would lead the charge was sitting in his home office, just a few kilometres away, during the July photo op. A former CEO of a resort and casino owned by the Enoch Cree, Robert Morin is a descendant of the Papaschase First Nation, which, in the eyes of Canada, no longer exists. After settlers pushed the bison&mdash;a pivotal animal in the Papaschase’s economy&mdash;to near extinction in the late 1800s, the First Nation withdrew to a small reserve in what’s now the city of Edmonton. As the town expanded, the government forced the Papaschase from their reserve and stripped them of their treaty status through a bureaucratic sleight of hand. Morin’s parents moved to Enoch Cree, where he grew up. He now calls Enoch home, but he never forgot the imprint of Canada’s lucrative dispossession over 100 years ago. The original Trans Mountain pipeline, pumping out over 250,000 barrels of oil daily, cuts across the Papaschase’s former reserve.</p>
<p>Last year, Morin became chairperson of <a href="https://www.projectreconciliation.ca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Project Reconciliation</a>, an Indigenous-led consortium vying for ownership of Trans Mountain and its new pipeline. “I had no choice but to get involved,” he says. Incomes among Enoch Cree members are well below the national average. And, with just under half of his home community in Enoch Cree Nation under the age of twenty-five, Morin is worried about adequate housing in the years to come. Funding for child welfare services also concerns him. With a name that crystallizes its ambition, Project Reconciliation offers a potential solution: financial independence from a government that has caused intractable harm. “If you have that extra wealth and that extra opportunity in revenue, you’re not depending upon the services of the government,” says Morin. Right now, those services are falling short, just as they have for over a century. If it goes through, Project Reconciliation could be the largest single Indigenous-owned energy investment in North America.</p>
<p>“We’ve survived here as First Nation people,” he adds. “We’ve been suppressed. And we’ve been pushed aside for the majority of the years that Canada has been a country. I think we have an opportunity here to change that.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n the past decade,</span> reconciliation has become a political sound bite and an aspirational mantra. In 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission defined it as “establishing and maintaining a mutually respectful relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples.” Critics of the term believe that the relationship remains too fraught to be fixed. They note that “terra nullius” (or land belonging to no one) was written into Canada’s founding legal doctrine, allowing colonists to ignore the original inhabitants. The idea still shapes the country’s laws. When First Nations try to affirm their collective rights enshrined in the constitution, they face what, in a 2018 speech, former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould called a “prove it” mentality. This often involves expensive court battles that demand reams of evidence of past occupation&mdash;evidence that has often been weakened or erased by colonialism itself. In other words, what is there to reconcile if respectful relations never existed?</p>
<p>In the midst of this reckoning, Project Reconciliation is driven by a simple premise: by buying into resource development on their lands, Indigenous peoples can narrow the wealth-and-power gap that exists with settlers. Project Reconciliation isn’t alone in this belief. Sixteen First Nations have tentatively agreed to a 10 percent stake in the Coastal GasLink pipeline under construction in northern BC. This year, a group of twenty-three First Nations and Métis communities signed a deal with Enbridge to buy a $1.12 billion minority stake in a network of pipelines in northern Alberta.</p>
<p>Such arrangements come in the wake of the costly lesson the oil-and-gas industry learned from Indigenous-led resistance. When the Northern Gateway pipeline was proposed for BC’s west coast in 2010, First Nations didn’t just challenge the line itself. They contended Canada had no right to make sweeping decisions about their territories&mdash;full stop. As the pipeline’s federal-review panel carried out hearings, the Idle No More movement spread across the country, calling for Indigenous sovereignty over land and water. Facing the spectre of relentless court challenges, the pipeline was soon on the rocks. In 2013, Ottawa-based Macdonald-Laurier Institute, a think tank whose funders include the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, recognized the playing field had changed and that partnering with nations was key to the industry’s future. Macdonald-Laurier’s solution was to offer First Nations equity&mdash;a financial share&mdash;in oil-and-gas projects affecting their territories.</p>
<p>The benefits seemed clear. Unlike the decades-long slog of fighting for title in the courts, negotiating with governments loath to give up control, and the dangerous prospects of asserting jurisdiction through lengthy blockades of roads or rail lines, the results of an Indigenous stake in resource development can be fast and straightforward: as soon as oil flows, money follows.</p>
<p>Those benefits have attracted two other competing bids for Indigenous ownership of Trans Mountain. They include the Chinook Pathways partnership&mdash;which seeks co-ownership with Pembina Pipeline Corporation, a Calgary-based company&mdash;and Nesika Services, a nonprofit representing communities along the pipeline’s route.</p>
<p>Morin, Project Reconciliation’s chairperson, believes his bid is the best choice. Project Reconciliation is unique, not only in seeking full ownership of the pipeline but also in its plan to direct a share of the profits into an “Indigenous sovereign wealth fund,” which would reinvest in clean-energy projects like carbon capture and storage, ideally transforming pipeline proceeds into a source of self-generating income. Project Reconciliation, says Morin, is “the only project that has talked about changing the revenue and the business component of Trans Mountain.” For an industry that has long treated Indigenous territories as its playground, such a fund could redirect wealth to those it had been taken from.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it remains unclear how certain the benefits of Project Reconciliation really are. To start, its scheme for structuring a possible purchase of Trans Mountain involves plentiful intermediaries. Pipeline companies are like landlords, and oil companies pay rent to use the pipe. Indigenous communities that sign on to Project Reconciliation would step into that role via a limited partnership&mdash;a business made up of distinct partners who shoulder different amounts of risk should the project go south. As long as they don’t physically stop the pipeline from running, Indigenous nations are shielded from liability, and the risk of losing money or going bankrupt falls exclusively on the financiers.</p>
<p>But such a scenario comes with a different gamble. The project would be funded entirely by debt in the form of bonds issued by a bank and sold to financial institutions, and that means lots of interest. Before reaping any financial benefits, in other words, Project Reconciliation will need to pay its bills. The biggest of these will be that debt&mdash;which, if Project Reconciliation meets the full $21.4 billion asking price, would amount to $1.07 billion annually for twenty years, not including interest. Then there’s the bill for the Trans Mountain Corporation, the government-owned company that is currently building the expansion and that Project Reconciliation intends to hire as the pipeline’s operator. TMC had $364 million in operating expenses last year. Insurance would take another big bite, and even with coverage, events like oil spills would encroach on profits&mdash;a relatively small leak from Trans Mountain on Sumas First Nation’s land in 2020 cost the company nearly $18 million to clean up.</p>
<p>Once the deal is in place to purchase the new and existing pipelines, Project Reconciliation’s role will shift to managing the business. It will charge the group of Indigenous nations that sign on $5 million per year for its services. So far, the project&mdash;which has a staff of twenty full-time employees&mdash;has already spent $4 million, and much of that comes from the retirement savings of Stephen Mason. A non-Indigenous oil-industry executive and consultant, Mason was asked in 2018 by the oil company Husky Energy (today Cenovus Energy) to help organize an Indigenous-led bid for the pipeline. Husky would ship its oil through the Trans Mountain expansion, and it had a vested interest in its success. Mason agreed. “We’ve got to change this,” he says, referring to the ways resource projects have frozen out First Nations. “If I can do anything as I’m nearing the end of my career, I can be part of that transformational change.” Today, Mason remains a major funder of Project Reconciliation. “I’m the bulk of it,” he says, declining to identify “a few” other funders. If the deal ever gets signed, he anticipates getting some of that money back.</p>
<p>After all those costs are factored in, a yet-to-be determined percentage of the proceeds will be diverted to the Indigenous sovereign wealth fund. What’s left will be distributed among the signatory nations as profit&mdash;they would receive different shares depending on their proximity to the line. The pivotal question: How much profit can they expect?</p>
<p>It all hinges on tolls&mdash;the fees oil companies pay to ship their oil. They are Trans Mountain’s sole source of revenue. So far, eleven oil companies have contracts binding them to toll payments for the next fifteen to twenty years. But their negotiated rates&mdash;baked into their contracts since 2013&mdash;are locked in below the project’s costs. This is one reason that Trans Mountain anticipates spending on cost overruns at least $10.5 billion more than it can hope to get back in toll revenue. In fact, a recent report found Trans Mountain would need to double its current tolls in order to be profitable&mdash;a hike that could negate the lauded financial benefits of shipping oil through the line. “The big problem with this project is that the tolls aren’t paying for it,” says economist Robyn Allan, who adds that, for a pipeline built entirely on debt, rising interest rates only compound that financial crunch.</p>
<p>Dennis Cornelson, Project Reconciliation’s managing director, remains confident the government would subsidize the sale and that shippers not locked into long-term contracts&mdash;which make up about 20 percent of the pipeline’s capacity&mdash;will shoulder higher costs. “The market has moved up in terms of what shippers are willing to pay,” he says. Despite a sea of unknowns, Project Reconciliation maintains that Indigenous nations that sign on could make more than $400 million in profits per year. “We don’t see it being any less,” says Mason. “It could be more.”</p>
<p>Project Reconciliation is now in discussions with the federal government. The company won’t disclose how many Indigenous nations have signed on. It has also yet to disclose how much those nations are willing to pay and what the costs of debt will be. But, to some, signing on isn’t just a question of revenue&mdash;there is also the risk the pipeline could go ahead with no Indigenous partners at all.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="smallcaps">iana Wolf Leg</span> has seen the consequences of an oil-and-gas project gone awry. Her First Nation, the Siksika Nation, an hour’s drive east of Calgary, entered into partnerships with oil companies that agreed to manage the infrastructure on its territory. “The oil company that came on to Siksika mismanaged it,” she says. “It just completely shut down.” Wolf Leg describes old oil drills sitting unchecked on the territory. “It’s just bad,” she says. (The Siksika Nation did not answer requests for comment.)</p>
<p>Wolf Leg is getting her bachelor’s degree in business at the University of Calgary. When it comes to Project Reconciliation, she started out ambivalent. “I wanted nothing to do with it,” she says. Her cousin, Gregory John, had worked as an outreach consultant with the project in its early stages and convinced her to start attending lunches and meetings with its representatives. “I’m like, ‘Okay, I’ll try it out,’” she says.</p>
<p>Over time, she grew more enthusiastic. The stream of income from the project, she decided, could provide breathing room to transition to a new, less-polluting economy. Now she’s the project’s lead outreach manager, sending emails to nations across the western provinces, asking them to meet with representatives of Project Reconciliation. Some are interested, some not. “It’s been hard,” she says, describing vitriolic messages from those against the pipeline and condescending meetings with industry executives and government officials who compliment her “exotic” earrings.</p>
<p>Project Reconciliation’s promotional materials make sunny predictions that an Indigenous-owned pipeline can support a new relationship between Canada and Indigenous nations. Wolf Leg is less upbeat. “I still don’t like the pipeline,” she says. What she sees in Project Reconciliation is a chance for Indigenous nations to have a say in the pipeline if it does go ahead and to be better protected from harm if it fails. “That hit something,” she says. “I was like, ‘Okay, I’m on board.’”</p>
<p>That line of thinking is familiar to Clifford Gordon Atleo, an assistant professor in resource and environmental management at Simon Fraser University. Whether accepting or denying resource extraction, he says, communities “come at it from the perspective of doing whatever they can to influence decisions or pressure decisions.” Since the 1600s, settler industries have damaged the lands Indigenous people lived and relied on. With their traditional livelihoods threatened, Indigenous nations adapted, finding their own ways to participate in the industrial-resource sector. Now many of those adaptive solutions are also on the brink, says Atleo. With the decline of traditional whale hunts, his own First Nation, the Nuu-chah-nulth on Vancouver Island, entered into the commercial-fishing industry on the west coast. The First Nation went from having 200 industrial fishing boats to just six over the span of one generation. Across the country, from Nova Scotia to British Columbia, Indigenous people working in sawmills faced wavering employment prospects due to unstable lumber markets and overlogging.</p>
<p>That history often leaves Indigenous people between a “rock and a hard place” when deciding if or how to engage with resource extraction on their territories, says Atleo. He bristles when colonial cultures hold Indigenous people up to an environmental-purity test that they themselves fail to clear, often with more resources and infrastructure at their disposal. When daily needs like housing and clean water aren’t being met, communities tend to make strategic, context-based decisions in the service of self-determination. They “try to leverage whatever they can” while making choices that align with their values, says Atleo. He still worries about the bind this puts Indigenous peoples in: embrace resource development or fall by the wayside. He questions visions of reconciliation centred on rampant economic growth. “Our participation comes with a cost,” he says.</p>
<p>Stewart Phillip, long-time chief of the Penticton Indian Band and current president of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs, calls economic reconciliation a “fairy tale” and initiatives like Indigenous ownership of Trans Mountain “razzle-dazzle economics.” Indigenous nations that hitch their economic futures to such resource projects are often beholden to the boom-and-bust cycles of resource politics, says Phillip. “What’s missing in all of those projects is long-term sustainability.” He says, “They’re all market driven, and more often than not, they fail.” For Phillip, true economic reconciliation requires more than just partnering with industry players. He also wants nations to receive a share of government revenue taken from and made on their land. That configuration would require Canadian governments to perceive Indigenous nations not as wards of the state but as governments themselves&mdash;a sea change in the relationship. “These are issues that no one&mdash;certainly not governments&mdash;wants to engage in,” Phillip says.</p>
<p>Many Indigenous people and First Nations remain opposed to the Trans Mountain pipeline. That includes the Tsleil-Waututh First Nation, whose reserve is a mere twenty-minute drive from the oil-storage tank farm that marks the pipeline terminus in Burnaby, just east of Vancouver. Tsleil-Waututh has spent years restoring the inlet that, prior to the colonial era, provided about 90 percent of their diet in the form of oysters, crabs, fish, and other seafood. In 2020, for the first time in nearly half a century, Tsleil-Waututh members harvested clams for the third year in a row. Stubbles of pearly herring eggs were found on the rocks of nearby False Creek for the first time since the 1800s. Stream restoration has bolstered still-threatened salmon runs, and transient orcas have made a cherished reappearance.</p>
<p>“The work that we’re doing is working, and things are starting to come back to the ecosystems that are natural to this territory,” says Charlene Aleck, a spokesperson for the Tsleil-Waututh Nation’s Sacred Trust Initiative, which is fighting the pipeline expansion in the courts and on the ground. That expansion could result in a roughly sevenfold increase in tanker traffic in Tsleil-Waututh waters, jumping from sixty to more than 400 tankers per year. The oil tanks, too, are expected to triple in size, holding over 5 million barrels of oil. Spills on land and at sea could be catastrophic, and then there’s the climate.</p>
<p>So far, Canada is one of the few G7 countries whose carbon emissions have increased since the 2016 Paris Agreement on climate change, and that’s without accounting for the emissions from oil produced here and burned elsewhere. The federal government claims Trans Mountain fits into Canada’s climate commitments because its revenue can fund the transition to renewable energy. Aleck disagrees. “To say we need this pipeline in order to pay for climate change is just like saying we need to sell more cigarettes to buy campaigns for lung cancer.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Trans Mountain’s revenues depend on Canada’s oil-and-gas sector growing for at least the next two decades, despite warnings that new investment will push temperatures beyond a 1.5 degree warming level if those fuels are combusted. According to geoscientist J. David Hughes, Canada’s oil-and-gas sector already produces enough carbon on its own to blow past the country’s 2050 climate target by 81 percent&mdash;even if all other emissions are reduced to zero. And the macro impacts of climate change could have a causal relationship to oil spills. Last year, a slew of disasters befell BC, including wildfires and floods that left sections of Trans Mountain’s existing pipeline bobbing loose in rivers where they used to be buried.</p>
<p>Rueben George, Sundance chief and member of the Tsleil-Waututh First Nation, isn’t willing to risk it. “It’s inevitable,” he says. “It’s not if a spill will happen but when.” Already, Trans Mountain has reported eighty-four oil spills to the Canada Energy Regulator since 1961. That number doesn’t include a 2020 spill that leaked over 150,000 litres on Sumas First Nation territory. According to a study from Simon Fraser University, published in 2015, the company says there’s a 99 percent chance of another spill in the next half century. When George calls the pipeline “economic smallpox,” it is hard to avoid thinking of the goods laced with deadly disease that early colonists traded to Indigenous communities. Still, George is cognizant of the tough decisions Indigenous nations face. “I don’t say anything bad about any nation that negotiated,” he says. “The hand we’ve been given to play has been devastating.”</p>
<p>It’s a point on which Morin agrees. “We’ve had 150 years of failure,” he says, referencing the years of economic exclusion. “Here’s a new direction.” </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/could-an-indigenous-owned-pipeline-be-a-force-for-good/">Could an Indigenous-Owned Pipeline Be a Force for Good?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>
