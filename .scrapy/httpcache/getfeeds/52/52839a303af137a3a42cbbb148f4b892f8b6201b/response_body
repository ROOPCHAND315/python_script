<p>It is the one letter whose name changes at the forty-ninth parallel. Even now, I can only read it as “Zed” with effort. You’ve read it too, and its sound in your mind tells you something important about who and where you are.</p>
<p>Z is a small hook on which I have hung an excessive weight of fear and hope. Z means that I am here. On most days, being in Canada does not mean much beyond the ordinary, but there are days when I cannot read or hear or say the letter Z without a sense of stupid, unearned relief. One was the day I watched, on my laptop in Toronto, rioters sack the Capitol. It was the first full pandemic winter: I remember the makeshift home office in our basement, the hum of the space heater, the snow melting on the doormat, the Capitol office where I worked in my twenties suddenly on the screen, with friends and old co-workers inside (mercifully unhurt, it turned out). That night, the same as every night, I sang my daughters the ABC song before bed: “.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;W, X, Y, and Zed.”</p>

<p>My family is American and has been for generations. I come from nineteenth-century Jewish immigrants on both sides. America’s democratic decline, or erosion, or backsliding&mdash;grave and heavy metaphors all&mdash;should not be my concern in anything other than the bloodless, calculative sense of the way it impinges on my new home. But countries don’t let us off that easily. Hence the claustrophobic sense that, even here, I am still there, in a violent place with more violence to come. Hence my interest in the letter Z.</p>
<p>I would like to believe that I have landed elsewhere, a place with a more usable past and a more open future. I don’t know when or if I’ll begin to think of myself as Canadian. I can’t predict how my three young daughters will come to think of themselves. But I know that a man with children, as the saying goes, has given hostages to fortune. I know that they are hostages to the fortune of <em>this</em> place. And so my feelings for this place, with all of the compounded love and worry and frustration, are bound up with the love and worry and frustration of a parent&mdash;in a way that the feelings grow more entangled the deeper my children’s roots here grow, in a way that I couldn’t begin to disentangle them if I tried.</p>

<p>In the United States, I played a bit role in American politics, as a speechwriter in the House and Senate, and then I went back to school to earn my PhD. Now I teach political theory in Toronto. When I try to explain what brought me here, I first look for one of the big capitalized nouns that dotted the immigration stories I learned growing up: Freedom, Religion, Opportunity. But in the space where the great abstract noun is supposed to be, I find only a human-sized tangle of motives. </p>
<p>There is the prosaic: a job. There is the prudential: excellent public schools, fewer guns, paid parental leave, a future in which my children are at least marginally less likely to be crushed under student debt or health care bills. And there are the motives I struggle to find words for even now&mdash;the clench in my stomach when I read the news from home, the foolish relief centred arbitrarily on the letter Z.  </p>
<p>Who are Canadians to me? “They” or “we”? Neither feels right. To tell Canadians what I believe <em>they</em> are and what I think <em>they</em> should do feels aloof and arrogant. More importantly, it feels false to our community of neighbours and friends here, people I certainly imagine sharing the first-person plural with me. And yet <em>we</em> still feels arrogant in its own right. Who am I, trailing my Americanness behind me, to tell Canadians who <em>we</em> are?</p>
<p>Fully aware that there is no satisfactory solution, I am making an arbitrary choice: <em>we</em>. Call it the aspirational <em>we</em>. The aspiration is simply this: that at some indefinite point in the future, it will come to be accurate.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">f there is one theme</span> in the literature of Canadian nationalism, it is the all-pervasive fear of being reduced to a cartographical fiction&mdash;or perhaps the fear that Canadians already are and simply, mortifyingly, haven’t noticed yet.</p>
<p>Historically, the Canadian fear of absorption has been compounded by the self-deprecating sense that our differences from America are trivial, that nothing much is in danger of being absorbed after all. As Northrop Frye put it: “What is resented in Canada about annexation to the United States is not annexation itself, but the feeling that Canada would disappear into a larger entity without having anything of any real distinctiveness to contribute to that entity.”</p>
<p>But that claim, if it ever was true, is simply not true anymore. Canadians of an older generation could look south and see a more or less equally democratic neighbour&mdash;louder and richer but not enormously distinct from English Canada. Canadians of this generation look south and see something that demands our fear. And this just at the moment we have lost the words for our differences.</p>
<p>Set aside the many millions of Americans who celebrate what their country is becoming; among the rest, over the past decade, I’ve observed a diversity of personalized breaking points that I can only describe as kaleidoscopic. A photo of an immigrant boy behind chain link, draped in a foil blanket. Police in riot gear smashing the head of an elderly protester onto concrete in upstate New York. The president, in a cloud of teargas, brandishing the Bible like a weapon. Uvalde, or El Paso, or Parkland, or Tree of Life, or Pulse nightclub, or Charleston, or Sandy Hook.</p>
<p>I don’t know how January 6 will be remembered, how my children will learn it in school one day: as a failure, a blip, the high-water mark of an authoritarian movement that Americans decisively rejected, beginning with the elections two years later, or as a trial run, a proof of concept, a beginning rather than an ending. But I also don’t know if I’ll ever see another American presidential election that both parties accept as legitimate. I do know that a majority of Republican representatives voted to overturn the 2020 presidential election. I know that, even in the midst of a disappointing midterm for their party, some 200 election-denying Republicans were elected to federal office. I know that nineteen states responded to the election of a Democratic president by rolling back voting rights. I know that politicians have long been in the practice of selecting their own voters for House elections, that the Supreme Court shows no inclination to stop them, and that the algorithms helping them draw their districts have never been more sophisticated. I know that the Senate is the institutional expression of white, rural, minority rule, and that this is fine, because America is a republic, not a democracy. I know what <em>autogolpe</em> means now. I suspect that American English is done being a net importer of authoritarian terms. </p>
<p>In June 2020, a reporter asked Justin Trudeau about Donald Trump’s threat to crush protesters with military force. Nothing sums up the Canadian response to all of these developments better than Trudeau’s famous twenty-one seconds of silence. Say what you will about him, but in that moment, he spoke authentically for his people: our terror at the mere thought of antagonizing the big neighbour, our self-congratulatory sense that truly bad things happen elsewhere, leavened by a pro forma allowance that, of course, we aren’t perfect (“It’s time for us as Canadians to recognize that we too have our challenges”).</p>
<p>Twenty months later, our capital was occupied, our crossings to America cut off, our Emergencies Act invoked for the first time. We too have our challenges.</p>
<p>It was commonly treated as a laugh line that one of the leaders of the Ottawa truck blockade, appearing in court, invoked his First Amendment rights. (“First Amendment?” asked the judge. “What’s that?”) But what a perfect illustration of the fact that the far-right movements in Canada and America are continuous with one another, that the forces that produced Trumpism in America are on the move here too: the same political vocabulary, the same collective imagination, the same conspiracy theories, the same funding sources. The same difficulty, among the political class in both countries, in imagining a constructive response to those forces beyond the sledgehammer of law enforcement.</p>
<p>What I heard in those twenty-one seconds of silence was the most eloquent expression possible of the great Canadian exemption: the idea that the forces upending democracies around the world somehow don’t reach this far north. What I saw in the Ottawa blockade&mdash;our own, slow-motion January 6&mdash;was its convincing refutation. Our exemption has rarely seemed less secure.</p>
<p>If that is true, then asserting our difference&mdash;asserting it in a way that shapes our culture, our diplomacy, our domestic politics, our sense of ourselves&mdash;matters in this generation in a way that it has rarely mattered before. Because there <em>is</em> a difference, beginning with this basic fact that has yet to penetrate our politics: <em>our neighbour is an eroding democracy</em>. </p>
<p>Canadian politics needs to start from that reality, because it is the political fact with the farthest-reaching consequences for Canadian life. Canada is not exempt from the polarization, the authoritarianism, and the conspiracizing that have put the future of American democracy into doubt. But Canada is different. If those forces are not so advanced here, it is not because Canada is congenitally behind the times. It is because our democracy can draw on a set of resources that are distinctly of this place. With that in mind, Canadian distinctiveness is not a vanity object: it is the essential safeguard of Canadian democracy.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">R</span><span class="smallcaps">eading reports</span> of the first shots of the American Civil War, the Ontario Reform leader George Brown said simply: “We are glad we are not them.” Our future depends on our ability to say something similar, and to mean it; to say it explicitly, not silently; to say it openly enough that it becomes an organizing principle of our national life, not simply a comforting excuse for our failures. Our future depends on our mental independence from America. We can’t effectively protect what sets us apart&mdash;from our own institutions like parliamentary government to a remarkable openness to immigration&mdash;without understanding what makes them our own. We can’t aspire to anything meaningfully better until we are secure in our difference, until we stop seeing ourselves through American eyes.</p>
<p>In saying that, I do not mean to imply that Canada is some sort of privileged child of history or that all this is a matter of our purity and their contamination. If anything, for much of our history, things have been the other way around. What I have to offer is not some sort of transcendent truth about national characters but rather a set of strategies adapted to the demands of this historical moment, taken in a broad sense&mdash;that is, the sense that does not expect the problem to be buried with Trump, the sense that does not expect the Canadian exemption to last in the absence of determined and creative action to lock it in place.</p>
<p>An eroding democracy is a threat to democracy in its neighbours. Think of the ways in which far-right and nativist forces collaborate across borders. Think of Tucker Carlson filming from Viktor Orbán’s Hungary, or Steve Bannon’s post-Trump career as a European fascist, or the cheers for Nigel Farage at a convention for American conservatives, or the pipeline of funding that connects Vladimir Putin and Marine Le Pen, or the 2023 re-enactment of the Capitol riot, planned from Orlando and staged in Brasília. Globally, as measured by Freedom House, those forces have contributed to sixteen consecutive years of democratic erosion. Such forces bear on Canada in many ways, from alleged Chinese interference in federal elections to real estate prices bid up by foreign oligarchs in Vancouver or Toronto. But, by virtue of proximity and power, the most important conduits of democratic instability run due south.</p>
<p>Those conduits are symbolized by the roughly 44 percent of funding for the Ottawa blockade that originated in the United States, by its round-the-clock promotion on Fox News and other right-wing media, and by its celebration in the American far-right and anti-vax movements. In the words of a 2022 report issued by Canadian intelligence experts, including high-level advisers to both the Harper and Trudeau governments, “the United States is and will remain our closest ally, but it could also become a source of threat and instability.” A little less cautiously, we might say that it already has. As one of the report’s authors put it, “there are serious risks of democratic backsliding in the U.S., and at this point, that is not a theoretical risk. So all of that is a threat to our sovereignty, to our security, and in some cases, to our democratic institutions.”</p>
<p>On their own, those facts are worrisome enough; in context, they are more so. The history of this hemisphere is a history of a hegemon willing and able to build up and pull down neighbouring governments&mdash;a history from which Canada has by no means been exempt. It is hard to imagine a democratically eroded America being <em>more</em> friendly to Canadian democracy, a democracy that would begin to look like a standing rebuke.</p>
<p>More abstractly, America’s power and prestige have always lent it a sort of political gravity. Powerful states, whatever their form of government, prompt envy and emulation. It seems as if they make the history the rest of us merely watch, as if they come from slightly in the future. They set the bounds of common sense within which the rest of us operate. Maybe an authoritarian America would provoke only revulsion here&mdash;I’m sure it would in many of us. But authoritarianism wouldn’t have a constituency if it didn’t have its own glamour and appeal. Slowly and steadily, without any of us explicitly acknowledging its influence and many of us loudly disclaiming it, it would shape our sense of what is possible here&mdash;of what is permissible here. </p>
<p>Resisting that process begins by looking the facts in the eye: the historical situation in which Canadians find themselves is fundamentally changed. Once, our connections to America were the many channels through which democratic ideas and practices entered our country; today, the situation is closer to the opposite. A free society cannot insulate itself from such influences, nor should it want to. But it can sharpen its critical capacity to assess and filter those influences as they arrive.</p>
<p>Our difference is not a luxury good, something for a rich and mostly contented people to worry about in the absence of more pressing concerns. On the contrary, it is our democratic immune system. And if that is the case, then the central challenge of Canadian politics at this moment is to develop and elaborate the idea of our difference; to discover, if we can, its deep roots in our history; and to give that idea an institutional and political expression.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="smallcaps">aturated as we are</span> by American media, and used to our position as a junior power on this continent, it is all too easy to see our difference through an American lens. What we see, and internalize, is a set of trivialities: milk in bags, beavers, some peculiar spellings. Even some potentially further-reaching facts, like universal health care, stand out in isolation, almost as accidents, maybe as objects that we are fearful of somehow misplacing. The prototypical American gesture toward Canada is a pat on the head. “A really nice apartment over a meth lab,” in Robin Williams’s famous line. America’s Hat.</p>
<p>I don’t want to read too deeply into that gesture, because it’s the privilege of any empire not to take too deep an interest in its smaller, weaker neighbours. For our part, we do not need others to take us seriously. We do need to take ourselves seriously. In that regard, the problem is that the triviality we see reflected back at us is the product of someone else’s needs, not our own. Much of our trouble in imagining ourselves as meaningfully separate serves political ends we never consented to and answers questions we ourselves never asked.</p>
<p>Canadians need to think more deliberately about building (in the words of David Graeber and David Wengrow) <em>structures of refusal</em>: deliberate, systematic choices about what to accept from our neighbour and what to reject, the choices through which we define and maintain our difference. We are what we refuse. In an age of democratic decline, Canada’s democracy depends on refusal&mdash;serious, targeted, and creative.</p>
<p>In my book <em><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.ca/books/Not-Here/Rob-Goodman/9781668012437" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Not Here: Why American Democracy Is Eroding and How Canada Can Protect Itself</a></em>, I lay out four key refusals, all of which can help make an authoritarian future less likely in Canada. The refusal of the dangerous idea of one “real” Canadian people. The refusal of political charisma and founder worship. The refusal to separate democracy from economic solidarity. And the refusal to let great-power conflict abroad justify democratic erosion at home.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">t times,</span> it seems as if the visible signs of our difference are so small and so slight that I’m a fool to hang so much on them. And then the light shifts, and they become the evidence of things unseen: the long “o” in <em>process</em> and <em>tomorrow</em> and <em>sorry</em>; “washrooms”; “lineups”; waiting for the light to change at the crosswalk, without a car in sight; the late onset of summer, so joyful that it hurts. <em>Things will be different here</em>. When the news from home is particularly bad, I’m embarrassed that things so trivial should be so consoling, ashamed by the intensity with which I want to believe that things will be different here, by the fear that they will not be.</p>
<p>I’ve been singing my daughters the ABC song at bedtime their whole lives. I changed it when we moved here: “.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;W, X, Y, and Zed.” <em>Things will be different here</em>. My youngest daughter is just a few months older than this book. My middle daughter has been here since she was two months old; she came in her sleep, facing backward in a bucket car seat in a van trailing a U-Haul, and that version is the only one she knows. But my oldest daughter still remembers when I sang it to her in our tiny apartment in the States, and she knows something about the difficulty of leaving; and whenever I try to change the last letter, she reacts with outrage that anyone would violate the sanctity of the alphabet. Before I can end, she claps her hand over my mouth: “Zee, man. It’s Zee.”</p>

The report from the province’s auditor general about the Ontario premier’s plan <a href="https://www.auditor.on.ca/en/content/specialreports/specialreports/Greenbelt_en.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">found damning evidence of corruption</a>. The integrity commissioner launched an investigation and <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/9928760/greenbelt-steve-clark-integrity-report/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">found the same</a>. The RCMP has since <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rcmp-criminal-investigation-ford-greenbelt-1.6991595" rel="noopener" target="_blank">launched a criminal probe</a>. Two staffers and two cabinet ministers resigned over it&mdash;and a third minister, Monte McNaughton, left for what he claims are unrelated reasons. Ford’s poll numbers plummeted, and his personal approval recently hit an <a href="https://angusreid.org/doug-ford-pc-greenbelt-steve-clark-developers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">all-time low</a> as the majority of respondents in one poll found the Greenbelt deal corrupt. The affair was so scandalous that after weeks of defending the plan, Ford reversed course and cancelled it.</p>
<p>Scandalous&mdash;but hardly surprising. There may not be enough hard drive space in the known universe to catalogue Ford’s many failures as premier. The Ontario Federation of Labour has a <a href="https://ofl.ca/ford-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ford Tracker</a>, which lets visitors “Follow &#038; fight Ford’s decisions that affect you.” It lists detailed, month-by-month fiascos, humiliations, and ignominies. You must click a “Read More” button to see the list, ten at a time. Clicking through, the minutes move slowly. Like it’ll never end. A few dozen clicks in, you start to wonder just how long it’s going to take to get to 2018&mdash;or however long back it goes.</p>

</ul>
<p>But you don’t have to spend the better part of a day clicking to know the Ford government has a long history of failure. It’s a history that runs from the embarrassing but frivolous to the grotesque and serious.</p>
<p>It’s problematic that Ford went a week without using his <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/9892929/doug-ford-faces-questions-personal-phone/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">government phone</a>, had in the past relied on an <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/doug-ford-can-t-give-up-his-blackberry-phone-neither-can-these-canadians/article_ff2d5ae4-7f7b-5978-9c77-c3e826e56f33.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unsecure Blackberry</a>, and reportedly <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx5qaq/doug-ford-is-holed-up-alone-learning-how-to-use-a-computer-report" rel="noopener" target="_blank">didn’t know how to use a laptop</a>. He fought the federal government on carbon pricing by <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/carbon-tax-gas-pump-stickers-ford-struck-down-1.5712981" rel="noopener" target="_blank">forcing gas stations to place decals</a> at the pump blaming the feds for higher gas prices&mdash;but they quite literally didn’t stick. That didn’t matter, though, since the courts struck down his plan. He procured new licence plates for the province that <a href="https://cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/licenceplates-driving-ontario-driver-407-1.5466551" rel="noopener" target="_blank">weren’t visible in the dark</a>. He pushed a gimmicky <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/doug-ford-announces-buck-a-beer-1.4775959" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buck-a-beer policy</a> that got next to no uptake.

<p>Ford also oversaw a government that failed so badly on long-term care that it led to deaths. He failed autistic children and their families, ignoring his own <a href="https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/doug-ford-s-record-on-autism-is-abysmal-on-june-2-consider-how-ontario-should/article_c7788cc0-2ccd-5c6a-8dc1-512cf63a2da1.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Autism Advisory Panel’s recommendations</a>. He ended <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rent-control-toronto-ford-series-1.6974129" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rent control</a> for new units during a housing crisis. He <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ford-toronto-councillors-supreme-court-1.5943656" rel="noopener" target="_blank">gutted Toronto City Council</a> midway through a local election, directly interfering in the city’s core democratic institution. He <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ford-proud-cancel-green-energy-1.5368745" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cancelled green energy contracts</a> that cost the province hundreds of millions of dollars. He <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/01/25/ontario-health-care-crisis-for-profit-services/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">launched a plan</a> to further privatize Ontario’s health care system. He <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/9779674/bill-124-timeline-ford-government/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">capped public sector wage</a> increases in a bill that was later struck down as unconstitutional. Later, he tried to <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/9243491/ontario-unions-reaction-ford-government-notwithstanding-clause/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">override the fundamental right of a union to strike</a>, employing the rarely used notwithstanding clause (for a second time) to nullify the Charter right.

He introduced a <a href="https://theconversation.com/doug-fords-reboot-of-sex-education-in-ontario-same-as-it-ever-was-122299" rel="noopener" target="_blank">much-maligned sex ed curriculum</a>. He abandoned the City of Ottawa during the 2022 convoy occupation. He <a href="https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/documents-reveal-ontario-has-no-immediate-plans-to-increase-odsp-ow-funds-despite-steadily-growing-caseload-1.6498417" rel="noopener" target="_blank">starved the Ontario Disability Support and Ontario Works programs</a> of new funding in the face of an increasing caseload. Earlier this year, a disabled woman was driven to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rose-finlay-medically-assisted-dying-odsp-1.6868917" rel="noopener" target="_blank">consider assisted death</a> rather than struggle to sort out ODSP.</p>
<p>There are more failures to list, but one can read only so many words in a day. As remarkable as the catalogue of catastrophes is, it’s just as extraordinary that Ford continues to govern Ontario and could still after the next election. Despite persistent calls for his resignation, he remains premier and, at least for now, seems to have a tight grip on his caucus.</p>
<p>Ford was defiant despite the recent Greenbelt reversal. He insists he <a href="https://www.cp24.com/news/here-s-what-to-expect-as-mpps-return-to-queen-s-park-1.6576049" rel="noopener" target="_blank">doesn’t govern by polls</a> and he could still win an election today. That may be true. He’s won two already&mdash;both majorities. His second win was bigger than his first despite his <a href="https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/when-ontario-s-magical-thinking-on-covid-19-fails-doug-ford-turns-to-plan-b/article_70ead801-38ca-59c9-8db9-6fe8738cc8aa.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pandemic mismanagement</a>, including <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-premier-doug-ford-absence-news-conference-1.6185940" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AWOL stints</a>.</p>
<p>Ford came to power and remained there thanks to a confluence of events it would be hard to recreate: the resignation of Tory leader Patrick Brown just ahead of the election <a href="https://macleans.ca/politics/patrick-brown-denies-troubling-allegations-in-hasty-statement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">amidst allegations of sexual misconduct</a>, a sliver-thin party leadership victory, voter fatigue with the Ontario Liberals, opposition party lethargy and strategic errors, and vote splitting among electors who could agree they didn’t want Ford but couldn’t agree on who they’d rather have.</p>
<p>The question now isn’t just how a province like Ontario&mdash;the most populous province in the country, home to Toronto, the economic engine and cultural capital of the country&mdash;ended up with a guy like Doug Ford as premier. The real question is: How do you get rid of him?</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="smallcaps">ord is emblematic</span> of a politics of complacency rooted in conservative orthodoxy and soft, phony populism&mdash;as if small government and low taxes can solve the multiple, intersecting crises we face so long as the orthodoxy comes with a smile and a double-double. When combined with an electoral system that favours parties with the capacity to target a narrow plurality of voters in the right place, it’s hard to dislodge a government like Ford’s, particularly when the opposition parties underperform.</p>
<p>Longevity despite government corruption, incompetence, wretched policy, and ethical breaches isn’t new in national and sub-national politics in Canada. The country was founded on scandal. The Pacific Scandal of 1873 saw the country’s founding prime minister, John A. Macdonald, resign after his government took an election fund kickback in exchange for awarding a contract to build the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1878, Macdonald won a majority and would go on to win the next three elections in a row. We put him on the $10 bill.</p>
<p>For years, the Liberal government of Jean Chrétien was haunted by allegations of questionable real estate dealings that came to be known as Shawinigate and by the Sponsorship Scandal. The Liberals managed to govern through them both until Chrétien’s successor, Paul Martin, lost in 2006.</p>
<p>The Conservative government of Stephen Harper, which replaced the Martin government, weathered the election-spending “In and Out” fiasco, the Robocall scandal, and the Couillard Affair, in which then foreign minister Maxime Bernier left classified military documents in his ex-girlfriend’s apartment. Harper also prorogued Parliament to skirt accountability around the government’s treatment of detainees in Afghanistan. Despite all of this, and more, Harper managed to hang to power for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government has faced several scandals and ethical lapses, including two regarding SNC Lavalin (one about campaign donations and the other about interference with the attorney general’s office) and a visit to the Aga Khan’s private island. For all his fumbles, Trudeau held on to government in 2019 and 2021, despite winning fewer votes than the federal Conservatives in each. By 2025, the year of the next scheduled election, the Trudeau government will have been in power for a decade.</p>
<p>Voters in Canada are patient and forgiving&mdash;until they’re not. Perhaps “patient” isn’t the right word. “Long suffering” might be better. Old wisdom says that governments are not defeated; they defeat themselves. They get arrogant, tired, sloppy; voters come to associate them with everything that’s gone wrong during their tenure, whether it was their fault or not. The 1980s Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney is a textbook example of the phenomenon. After winning back-to-back majorities in 1984 and 1988, the party was reduced to two seats in the House of Commons in the 1993 election, just months after Kim Campbell took over from Mulroney.</p>
<p>Ford has managed to leverage the political upheaval from voter unhappiness into a winning formula. In the 2018 Ontario election, after fifteen years in power, the provincial Liberals were wildly unpopular. The PCs won seventy-six seats and formed a majority government with 40.5 percent of the vote, compared to the New Democratic Party’s forty seats and 33.6 percent vote share. Turnout was 56.7 percent. The vast majority of voters&mdash;nearly 60 percent of them&mdash;preferred someone other than Ford as premier, but the province ended up with him nonetheless.</p>
<p>The 2022 election told a similar story, with Ford turning a 40.8 percent vote share into an even bigger majority, with eighty-three seats. The NDP and Liberals managed 23.7 percent and 23.9 percent respectively, and the Greens came in at just under 6 percent. This time, however, turnout was a dismal 43.5 percent. That meant the Ford government won a mere 18 percent of eligible voter support.</p>
<p>In both elections, particularly in 2022, the opposition parties were so busy fighting one another that Ford’s win became that much easier. As Liberal leader Steven Del Duca said to NDP leader Andrea Horwath at the time, “Every time you attack me&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;Doug Ford smiles.” That was true. And vice versa, of course. The two sides were fighting for the centre and centre-left vote, which was split then and is still split now.</p>
<p>While the centre and centre-left vote is sundered, the PCs will enjoy an electoral advantage, since voters will divide themselves between the Liberals and the NDP, preventing either from winning enough votes to unseat Ford. If the vote begins to coalesce around either the NDP or the Liberals, the PC government’s prospects will change, but that isn’t quite happening yet. And it may not if the opposition parties, particularly once the Liberals choose a new leader, fight amongst themselves as much as, or more than, they fight the premier. For now, Ford and his government remain in a comfortable&mdash;if not iron-clad&mdash;place. And Ford knows it.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">V</span><span class="smallcaps">oters are angry,</span> tired, and disaffected. They don’t see themselves in their province’s politics. For years, people have fought to get through the day and believe that Queen’s Park has left them behind. For many, Ford speaks to their struggles&mdash;and promises to meet their needs and interests. But there’s more to it than that. Cynicism, alienation, and the shortcomings of the opposition parties have also contributed to Ford’s electoral success. Continued political disappointment and the structural exclusion of people from political life depresses political action, drives down electoral turnout, and exacerbates poor governance.</p>
<p>While people tune out politics, no opposition party has yet rallied enough voters and convinced them that it is <em>the</em> alternative to Ford. Each thinks it ought to be them and not the other side. Of course they do&mdash;it’s their job. But the effect of doing that job and following immediate interests is that Ford obtains an electoral advantage. This is an old problem in multi-party single member plurality (first-past-the-post) electoral systems, one that Ford and his PCs are counting on.</p>
<p>The forty-fourth Ontario election is scheduled for the summer of 2026. That’s over two and a half years away. The New Democrats elected a new leader, Marit Stiles, last February. She’s breathed new life into the party and used Ford’s Greenbelt failures to hammer the premier. The Liberals are set to elect their own new head in December, and they find themselves neck and neck with the NDP in the polls despite being leaderless. But Ford and his Tories still enjoy more than a <a href="https://338canada.com/ontario/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ten-point projected lead</a> on each of them.</p>
<p>The Greenbelt scandal has yet to reach its apogee, but Ford said he isn’t worried about the scandal. And he, while cynical, is right not to worry too much <em>for the moment</em>. But between now and the next chance to hold his government to account at the ballot box lies what amounts to decades in political time. Lots can happen in two and a half years&mdash;scandals add up, failures start sticking to you. Voters do eventually tend to get tired and fed up with governments. The PCs governed Ontario uninterrupted between 1943 and 1987 after initially replacing a Liberal grouping that had decayed over the years while in power and was later reduced, like its successors decades later, to third position in the legislature.</p>
<p>It’s hard&mdash;and indeed chilling&mdash;to imagine a PC government in Ontario lasting over four decades today. It’s worse to imagine this one lasting another month, let alone much longer. But Ford and his side remain political survivors with an enviable electoral advantage and just enough shame to appear to care. That is a dangerous, often successful, combination that Ontarians may have to live with for the foreseeable future.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/we-may-be-stuck-with-doug-ford/">We May Be Stuck with Doug Ford</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

The forty-five-year-old was a prominent figure in the Sikh community in BC. He had moved to Canada from the Indian state of Punjab in 1997 and worked as a plumber. At the time of his killing, he was president of the Sikh temple in Surrey. Many in the Sikh community in Canada believed that the Indian government had something to do with the murder. Then, on September 18, following weeks of worsening ties with India, <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/justin-trudeau/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau</a> made it official. “Over the past number of weeks,” he said in Parliament, “Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the government of India and the killing of a Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijjar.” India has denied the accusation, calling it “absurd.”</p>
<p>Nijjar had been <a href="https://thewire.in/world/hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-khalistan-speculation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">declared a terrorist</a> in India in late 2020. A press release issued at the time by the National Investigation Agency, India’s specialized counterterrorism law enforcement agency, stated that Nijjar stood accused of “launching a concerted secessionist campaign” for the creation of Khalistan, a separate sovereign state for Sikhs in South Asia. The separatist Khalistan movement had been at its peak in Punjab in the 1980s but lost steam after the violent insurgency was crushed through sustained operations by Indian security forces, which included the storming of the Golden Temple, the holiest Sikh shrine, in the city of Amritsar in 1984. India remains strongly opposed to the Khalistan movement and is particularly irked by many in the Sikh diaspora who continue to demand a separate homeland for Sikhs. </p>

</ul>
<p>Nijjar was a vocal backer of Khalistan and was associated with the group Sikhs for Justice, which organized a referendum in Brampton, Ontario, last fall over the creation of Khalistan. Part of a global series of votes aimed at gauging consensus, the turnout of thousands of people negated claims of its being a fringe movement. Nijjar had been planning another referendum this month in Surrey. </p>
<p>In June, adding to the speculation about the Indian government’s role in the killing were <a href="https://twitter.com/HindolSengupta/status/1677748407019147264" rel="noopener" target="_blank">celebratory social media posts</a> by Hindu nationalists in India: he was the <a href="https://thewire.in/world/hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-khalistan-speculation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">third pro-Khalistan leader</a> to die outside the country in forty-five days. Others <a href="https://theprint.in/opinion/security-code/in-hardeep-singh-nijjar-killing-look-beyond-the-usual-suspect-there-is-gangs-guns-and-god/1651294/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">claimed</a> that Nijjar’s killing was part of a toxic war for the control of well-funded Sikh religious institutions in Canada, waged through criminal networks (though the charge has not been substantiated further). The Indian government maintained a cryptic silence, allowing rumours about its part in the mysterious murder to flourish. </p>
<p>Following the killing, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/crime/masked-suspects-fled-on-foot-after-killing-sikh-leader-hardeep-nijjar" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote</a> to then public safety minister Marco Mendicino, asking him to investigate. Singh underscored that the murder happened “just a few weeks after the National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister described India as one of the top sources of foreign interference targeting Canadians.” He was referring to a conference held by the Canadian Global Affairs Institute in Ottawa on June 2, where Jody Thomas, the national security and intelligence adviser to Trudeau, had included India among authoritarian states like Russia, Iran, and China.</p>
<p>Thomas’s allegation was rebutted by India’s external affairs minister, S. Jaishankar, at a press conference on June 8 in New Delhi. He said that he was reminded of the Hindi expression “ulta chor kotwal ko daante,” tantamount to “the pot calling the kettle black”&mdash;arguing that India was the aggrieved party in terms of foreign interference because Canada was giving space “to separatists, extremists.” </p>
<p>The Indian government, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, believes Canada has been negligent in addressing its concerns about Sikh separatists because the ruling coalition in Ottawa is dependent on Sikh votes during elections. Jaishankar’s aggressive statements&mdash;and Trudeau’s explosive allegations&mdash;give credence to theories that if Canada won’t tackle Sikh separatists on its soil, India will. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smallcaps">hile Canada’s federal agencies</span> have indirectly warned about India’s interference in Canadian politics in recent years, it has rarely been done by name or in public and has almost always been kept buried in internal documents. According to the Canadian Press, heavily redacted official documents released last year under the Access to Information Act revealed “the <a href="https://torontosun.com/news/national/india-among-top-sources-of-foreign-interference-in-canada-jody-thomas" rel="noopener" target="_blank">potential for foreign interference</a> stemming from Indian students’ concerns that Canada was slow to grant required study permits.” Prior to that, a 2018 report prepared for deputy ministers attending a retreat on national security had warned that Indo-Canadians were among those running the risk of “being influenced, overtly or covertly, by foreign governments with their own agendas.” It warned that “the lines between legitimate advocacy and lobbying and pressures imposed to advance the economic and political interests of foreign actors are becoming increasingly blurred.”</p>
<p>That year, Thomas’s predecessor, Daniel Jean, had suggested that rogue elements in the Indian government had sought to embarrass Trudeau during his 2018 visit and may have allowed a Sikh separatist to visit India just to embarrass the Canadian leader “for being soft on Sikh separatism.” In his book <em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/600389/trudeau-by-john-ivison/9780771048951" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trudeau: The Education of a Prime Minister</a></em>, journalist John Ivison quotes the prime minister’s former principal secretary Gerald Butts accusing Modi of trying to “screw” Trudeau during the trip and helping his opposition, the Conservatives. The trip had started off on a disappointing note as the Trudeau delegation was received at the airport by a junior minister, not even a member of Modi’s cabinet. International and local observers speculated that Trudeau was being snubbed over his ties with separatists. The disastrous visit had marked the nadir of bilateral ties between the two countries. India was angry over Trudeau’s presence at a Sikh event in Toronto in 2017. Indian media had reported that the event included the display of Khalistani flags; posters of the Sikh separatist leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who was killed in the army operation of 1984 at the Golden Temple; and a celebration of a motion passed by the legislative assembly of Ontario calling the anti-Sikh riots in India in 1984 a genocide. </p>
<p>Trudeau had seemed visibly miffed by the treatment he received in India, and the Hindu nationalist government under Modi was not keen to make amends. Ties between the two governments worsened in the next couple of years as the Indian side felt that Trudeau’s government was supporting Sikh separatists for its own electoral gains. “Frankly, we are at a loss to understand, other than the requirements of vote bank politics, why anybody would do this,” Jaishankar alleged at the press conference this June. “If anybody has a complaint, we have a complaint about Canada&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;the space that they are giving to Khalistanis and to violent extremists,” he claimed. A fortnight later, <a href="https://twitter.com/suhasinih/status/1674046697855655936" rel="noopener" target="_blank">he said</a>, “We made it very clear [to Canada]&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;that if there are activities which are permitted from Canada that impinge on our national security, territorial integrity and security, then we will have to respond.” </p>
<p>The tensions resonated at the G20 summit held in New Delhi earlier this month. As per an official statement put out by the Indian side, Modi conveyed strong concerns about “continuing anti-India activities of extremist elements in Canada [who] are promoting secessionism and inciting violence against Indian diplomats, damaging diplomatic premises, and threatening the Indian community in Canada and their places of worship.” On Khalistan extremism and foreign interference, Trudeau, on the other hand, said, “They both came up. Over the years, with Prime Minister Modi, we’ve had many conversations on both of those issues&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;Canada will always defend freedom of expression, freedom of conscience, freedom of peaceful protest. That’s something that’s extremely important to us. At the same time, we are always there to prevent violence, to push back against hatred.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">s an authoritarian leader,</span> Modi is not receptive to any democratic protest, as reflected in India’s being downgraded to an electoral autocracy by Sweden’s V-Dem research institute. In 2020, Indian farmers organized a major successful agitation on the outskirts of New Delhi against new agriculture laws promulgated by the government. The protests lasted for months and involved tens of thousands of farmers and their families. Sikhs happened to provide the bulk of the leadership of the movement and garnered a lot of sympathy and support from their religious brethren in Canada. The ideologues of Modi’s party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, tried to discredit the protesting Sikhs as pro-Khalistan separatists, a technique they have perfected by labelling any protest by Indian Muslims as being pro-Pakistan. When the Canadian government expressed concern about some of the harsh policing measures unleashed on the farmers, New Delhi accused it of meddling in India’s internal affairs. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pro-government media in India prominently covered news of a so-called Khalistan referendum by Sikh separatists and the defacement of some Hindu temples in Canada by extreme elements of the Sikh community, further inflaming anger in New Delhi. The Indian government <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-canada-fms-discuss-reset-in-ties-with-indo-pacific-strategy/article66479145.ece" rel="noopener" target="_blank">issued a statement</a> in which it expressed its disappointment that the “perpetrators of these crimes have not been brought to justice so far in Canada” despite its appeals to the Trudeau government. </p>
<p>Last year’s arrangement between Trudeau’s Liberals and Jagmeet Singh’s NDP&mdash;whereby the latter would support the government in some matters&mdash;seemed to confirm the apprehensions about him in New Delhi. Singh has made statements that can be seen as being pro-Khalistan and has publicly accused India of human rights violations against Sikhs in Punjab. Under his leadership, the NDP has also argued that Canada should limit its ties to the South Asian nation. In India, Singh is seen as part of the violent separatist movement that wrecked Punjab in the 1980s and ’90s. For Modi’s government, Singh is a persona non grata, even though that may not be his formal status in official records. Those in coalition with his party stand tarnished by association. </p>
<p>The fear of the rise of Sikh separatism in Canada feeds into the insecurities and vulnerabilities&mdash;about India’s sovereignty, integrity, and unity&mdash;in New Delhi. Punjab passed through a decade-long cycle of violent separatist insurgency, which ended in the mid-1990s but whose trauma continues to afflict India’s security establishment. The country’s top security czar since 2014, Ajit Doval, is a former intelligence operative whose career highlight has been intelligence operations against Sikh separatists in Punjab in the 1980s. He is aware of the networks that operated in Canada and that, he believes, continue to harbour renegades even now. Doval’s memories, revived during the farmers’ protest of 2020/21, have driven the Indian attitude regarding Canada and the UK, two countries considered by New Delhi to be soft toward Sikh separatists.</p>
<p>India has also recently been courted globally, especially by the Joe Biden administration, which laid the red carpet for Modi during his first official state visit to Washington, DC, in June. Buoyed by its self-image as a global power, New Delhi sees tough Canadian action against Sikh groups as a precondition for healthy bilateral ties. India’s ultimatum has, however, fallen on deaf ears. For Canada, as a democracy that values strong institutions, ties with India are important but not critical enough to dispense with democratic norms about religious minorities&mdash;even when Sikh organizations take a separatist line. The Indian security establishment, under Doval, has now drawn accusations of taking matters into its own hands and being involved in the killings of pro-Khalistan leaders outside India. </p>
<p>At the same time, Sikh separatism is the logical corollary to the idea of India as a “Hindu Rashtra,” a Hindu nation. The Hindu Rashtra would entail an interpretation of Hindu texts, such as those elaborating the caste system, and the construction of a state and laws based on those texts. In the most extreme interpretation, it could also be exclusionary, where only Hindus can hold certain offices by law and discriminatory practices are legally instituted against religious minorities such as Muslims. It has been a long-standing dream of the Hindu right wing to see India transform from the plural, tolerant, and diverse country it has been, as enshrined in its Constitution, into a Hindu nation where the religious majority is dominant and firmly in power. That dream is now being vigorously pursued by Modi’s party and is unofficially already a reality in many ways. Radical Sikhs argue that if India can be a country only for Hindus, then Sikhs should also have their own sovereign state in the form of Khalistan. </p>
<p>The matter gets complicated because the ideologues of Hindutva, or Hindu nationalism, see Sikhs as Hindus, a claim Sikhs vehemently oppose. As per the logic of this ideology, which is based on the principle of Hindu dominance, people are considered loyal to the land where the holy sites of their religion exist. For Modi’s party, Sikhs (even though they may be Canadian for generations) are Indians as they are seen as Hindus, but even Sikhs who batted for a plural India and fought against Khalistan are neither willing to be considered Hindus nor willing to accept India as a Hindu Rashtra. “The Khalistani threat needs to exist, and they hype it up,” Hartosh Singh Bal, senior journalist and executive editor of <em>The Caravan</em> magazine, told me, referring to the view of Modi’s party and its parent body, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, “to explain [away] the strong and sustained opposition by ordinary Sikhs to their ideological project.” </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he current state</span> of Canada–India relations goes against the grain of the ties the two countries have historically shared, reaching back to India’s colonial era, when freedom fighters ran their fight against the British from Canada. The two countries are also members of the Commonwealth. As democracies established on the liberal values and concepts of inclusiveness, religious freedom, and the welfare state, they share a natural affinity. Canada is home to one of the largest diasporas of Indian heritage in the world, at over 1.3 million. India is the top country of origin for international students in Canada. In 2021, Canada accepted a record 400,000-plus immigrants, and India accounted for approximately 128,000 of them. As a percentage, Sikhs form a larger share of the national population in Canada than they do in India. Bilateral trade between the two countries was expected to hit a range of $4.4 billion to $6.5 billion (US) until negotiations ran aground in the wake of recent tensions.  </p>
<p>The regressively nationalist Modi government, however, finds the liberal values publicly espoused by Trudeau to be antithetical to the ideas it espouses on many social, cultural, and political issues. For instance, when Jaishankar disparaged the Trudeau government for its unwillingness to act against Sikh separatists, he portrayed it as an imperative of “vote bank politics.” The term is unique to India’s political lexicon. It has been used by Hindutva ideologues to discredit voting by religious minorities in India for liberal parties, contending that they are captive voters of such parties. He implied the same in the case of Sikh voters and the Liberal–NDP arrangement in Canada, suggesting that there is an appeasement of extremist Sikh groups for their votes. Tacit in his remarks is the implication that Canada should not look after its religious minorities but deal with them as Modi’s majoritarian regime treats minorities in India, politically disempowering Sikhs to the same extent.</p>
<p>The absence of a natural fit between the two governments is compounded by Canada’s lack of hard power which could be of immediate use to India against China. It is here that much was expected after Canada released its Indo-Pacific strategy in 2022 with the aim of establishing closer economic and scientific ties. Things started looking up when the two governments agreed to start negotiations on an interim trade agreement. “2023 could become the year of India–Canada reset, given the Indo-Pacific strategy convergence, trade talks which could culminate in an Early Progress Trade Agreement, and a number of high-level meetings this year,” former Indian high commissioner to Canada Ajay Bisaria had told the <em>Hindu</em> at the start of the year.</p>
<p>But with the expulsion of top diplomats from both countries following Trudeau’s accusation, the initial enthusiasm for cooperation has waned. Earlier this month, in the midst of strained relations between the two countries, Canada announced it would postpone a trade mission to India scheduled for the following month. No reason was offered at the time. The killing of Nijjar and the allegations and counter allegations&mdash;at the highest levels of government&mdash;of foreign meddling show that bilateral ties between India and Canada have hit their lowest point yet, holding the relationship, which has so much to offer to the people of the two countries, hostage.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/india-canada-relations/">Why Would India Assassinate a Sikh Leader on Canadian Soil?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1600" height="1067" src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Cyca_TrudeauSplit_Alamy_1800.jpeg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="A 2017 photo of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his then-wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau in Hamburg, Germany." loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="" srcset="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Cyca_TrudeauSplit_Alamy_1800.jpeg 1600w, https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Cyca_TrudeauSplit_Alamy_1800-735x490.jpeg 735w, https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Cyca_TrudeauSplit_Alamy_1800-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Cyca_TrudeauSplit_Alamy_1800-1200x800.jpeg 1200w, https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Cyca_TrudeauSplit_Alamy_1800-348x232.jpeg 348w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n the spring</span> of 2005, Sophie Grégoire wed <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/justin-trudeau/">Justin Trudeau</a>, son of a Canadian prime minister. She arrived at the Montreal church in a 2004 Rolls-Royce Phantom, wearing a custom gown from local atelier Les Noces Couture and clutching a bouquet of white roses. After the Catholic ceremony, 180 guests enjoyed a reception at the now-closed Hotel Le St-James, where they dined on Alberta beef and danced to Brazilian music. The couple’s relationship began in 2003, on a romcom-worthy first date during which Canada’s future prime minister was so lovestruck that he walked into a lamppost. We know all these details because <em>Maclean’s</em> was granted access for a behind-the-scenes feature to cover their big day. The magazine reported that the ceremony was “intimate and personal,” part of “a sweet and appropriately understated fairy-tale wedding.” </p>
<p>But the fairy tale ended on August 2, after eighteen years of marriage, when Grégoire and Trudeau made synchronized <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/instagram/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Instagram</a> posts revealing they had separated, in a cordial message shared in both official languages. Their separation followed a well-worn celebrity template established in 2014 by exonerated ski resort menace Gwyneth Paltrow and Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, who popularized the term “conscious uncoupling” in an announcement that has been riffed on by public figures ever since. The format is one of scrupulous civility and faultless unity, which emphasizes the couple’s mutual agreement to separate, their shared respect for one another, and their desire for privacy, all summarized briefly in a tasteful text-image posted to the grid. </p>
<p>Responses were immediate. Some were malicious, others thirsty, but they were drowned out by characteristically Canadian politeness. From across the political spectrum, a chorus of voices proclaimed the announcement to be none of anyone’s business. “Trudeau and his policies deserve criticism, not his personal life,” tweeted political columnist Brian Lilley, while journalist <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/author/david-moscrop/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">David Moscrop</a> agreed: “My take on the Trudeau separation is I don’t care and I don’t see how it affects the public interest in any significant way.” While it’s unquestionable that there is no place or purpose for cruel speculation, Trudeau’s marriage and private life have always been a deliberately cultivated topic of public interest&mdash;one that has propelled and shaped his trajectory as a politician.</p>

<li><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-false-promise-of-trudeaus-sunny-ways/">Reconciliation: The False Promise of Trudeau’s Sunny Ways</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It makes perfect sense that Trudeau, who intimately understands his own celebrity and the power of social media, would share the news of his separation this way. Trudeau’s Instagram account has been instrumental in his political career and image making&mdash;a space for building one of the key pillars of his savvy personal brand: that of friendly approachability and intimate access. All politicians are performers, but Trudeau, with a lifetime of experience in the public eye and an actor’s instincts, is better than most at playing to an audience. </p>
<p>While Trudeau’s father, Pierre, was packaged as a different variety of leading man&mdash;a rogue and a playboy&mdash;the younger’s charisma was calibrated to twenty-first-century preferences: here was Hot Dad. In 2014, <em>Chatelaine</em> published a profile of Trudeau with the <a href="https://chatelaine.com/living/is-justin-trudeau-the-candidate-canadian-women-have-been-waiting-for/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unsubtle headline</a> “Is Justin Trudeau the candidate women have been waiting for?” The focus was not explicitly on his politics but, instead, on what his personal life conveyed about them. Here was “a loving, hands-on parent; a warm, approachable counterpoint to Stephen Harper,” his predecessor who <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/archive/ca/entry/harpers-handshake-with-son-book-claims-pm-was-hurt-by-reaction_n_4136852" rel="noopener" target="_blank">had been mocked</a> in the media for formally shaking hands with his own children at school drop-off. In contrast, the lavish photo spread in <em>Chatelaine</em> showed Trudeau joyfully lofting his baby in the air, piling onto a surprisingly regular-looking couch with his adorable kids, and&mdash;pushing the limits of credibility&mdash;posing in the pool, all five family members fully clothed and laughing. </p>
<p>Witness the praise heaped upon a man who takes his own children to the playground and you will understand, as Trudeau’s PR team did, that our society loves an engaged, devoted father. It resonated well with his platform: progressive, pro-choice, “woman-friendly.” Where his father was an unabashed champion of coercive assimilation, Trudeau promised reconciliation and justice for Indigenous people. The Conservative opposition campaign tried to brand him as a frivolous, floppy-haired celebrity who was “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQOcN5uOlBc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">not ready</a>” to lead, but his visible role as paterfamilias demonstrated commitment, seriousness, maturity. This was communicated explicitly in his campaigning, which subverted the “not ready” messaging to critique the Conservative status quo and was also reinforced through his savvy use of social media.</p>
<p>For politicians who are always trying to downplay their elite credentials and convince the public of their relatability and authenticity, social media can be a tremendous asset. Instagram is a highly mediated space that offers the illusion of direct access and genuine, unscripted interaction. As cultural critic and writer Anne Helen Petersen <a href="https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-thread-vibes-are-off" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pointed out</a> in her Substack publication, <em>Culture Study</em>, “The conversation [on Instagram] is easier to both control and ignore; of all the social networks, it most closely resembles the fawning broadcast style of the fan magazine.” And Trudeau, born into the spotlight, has a masterful ability to control a conversation. </p>
<p>A 2016 <em>Globe and Mail</em> article about <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-unmediated-photo-is-themessage/article31389091/">Trudeau’s dynamic</a> with his photographer, Adam Scotti, called him “the first prime minister of the Instagram age” and described the process of “meticulously selecting” images for his social media accounts. “This Prime Minister’s use of photography transcends his looks and comfort in the spotlight,” wrote journalist Eric Andrew-Gee. Trudeau was keenly aware of the messages conveyed by his facial expressions and carefully chosen clothing. Even off script, he understands how to harness the power of social media to reinforce his political image. In April, <a href="https://globalnews.ca/video/9622731/wow-trudeau-challenges-young-ppc-supporter-after-anti-abortion-statements" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a clip</a> of his interaction with a People’s Party of Canada supporter at a University of Manitoba event went viral after Trudeau confidently parried the young man’s anti-abortion arguments, getting the last word in before moving on with a smile. This is not to say that his actions are insincere, only that he always knows how they’ll play on camera&mdash;as he did in 2014, when he helped to carry a man in a wheelchair down a set of stairs at a Montreal metro station in an unscripted act of thoughtfulness and brawniness that <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/archive/ca/entry/justin-trudeau-carries-man-in-wheelchair-down-stairs-photo_n_5159721" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quickly went viral</a>.</p>
<p>The problem, after eight years, is that while Trudeau’s personal performance has remained flawless, his politics and promises have not lived up to it. He did not get rid of the first-past-the-post system of elections, or make government more transparent and accessible, or live up to his promises on reconciliation. During his tenure, the national crises of health care, housing, and climate change have worsened. And while he is still garnering sizable public approval compared to previous prime ministers, including his father, <a href="https://angusreid.org/trudeau-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his support has slipped</a>, according to data from Angus Reid. No matter how carefully chosen, images can do only so much to compensate for actions&mdash;and inactions. It’s hard now to picture Trudeau ambling shirtless and carefree into a candid photo, as he did on two separate occasions in a single week of 2016; times and expectations have changed as Canada’s economic and social struggles have grown more serious, and Trudeau’s image as a leader is evolving with them. A country in crisis does not want to see its prime minister flexing his abs on a Tofino surf trip or goofing around in the family pool. </p>
<p>With the separation post, Trudeau is publicly entering a new chapter in his personal life, which, as he has built it, is also his political life. (Grégoire is entering a new chapter as well, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/books/sophie-gr%C3%A9goire-trudeau-publishing-two-books-on-the-importance-of-personal-and-collective-wellness-1.6847879" rel="noopener" target="_blank">with a self-help book</a> about “self-knowledge, acceptance, and empowerment,” scheduled for release next spring.) Inevitably, it will be a chapter no less visible, no less curated, no less scripted than it was before. The separation announcement may be many things: sad, sincere, personal. But it’s not uncalculated, nor is it meaningless. No Canadian prime minister has ever won four consecutive elections, as Trudeau hopes to do in the next election, and he’ll almost certainly be drawing on his personal life to bolster his political image once again. His brand is evolving, and whatever the new role of Divorcé Trudeau may look like, one thing is certain: he’s still aware of his audience.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/trudeau-split/">Of Course We’re Interested in the Trudeau Split</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

Jean Carroll <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/e-jean-carroll-discusses-trumps-comeuppance" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was asked</a> whether her legal victory against <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/donald-trump/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a> represented the former president’s long-awaited comeuppance. Her response captured the spirit of the moment: “I think it just may be.”</p>
<p>She appeared tentatively hopeful. The interview was published two and a half weeks after <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/e-jean-carroll-trump-lawsuit-battery-defamation-verdict/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a jury found</a> Trump had sexually abused Carroll. Finally, a court of law had nailed Trump for his frequently repulsive behaviour toward women. Just thirteen days after that verdict, he was indicted on <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-2nd-indictment-1.6870727" rel="noopener" target="_blank">thirty-seven criminal charges</a>, including conspiracy to obstruct justice. He could face up to twenty years in prison if convicted on all charges. And this week he was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66263089">indicted once again</a>: four more counts for attempting to upend the 2020 presidential election results.</p>
<p>Some of his most prominent allies are also in trouble. In April, Tucker Carlson <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/4/25/23697600/tucker-carlson-tonight-fox-news-dominion-lawsuit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was fired</a> from Fox News, excused from the show that bore his name and which was, for a time, the most watched cable news program in history. And in May, George Santos, a Trump-aligned congressman whose myriad lies about his biography have made international headlines, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/congressman-george-santos-charged-fraud-money-laundering-theft-public-funds-and-false" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was charged</a> with a slew of crimes, including wire fraud and money laundering.</p>

</ul>
<p>I’ve taken pleasure in watching Trump and those who propped him up finally face some kind of reckoning. If a progressive’s aim is to defeat the enemies of progress, then we’ve lurched ahead in the war against injustice. Why shouldn’t I savour these wins? </p>
<p>What I’m experiencing is schadenfreude, a German term for the pleasure we derive from the misfortune of others. There isn’t a precise English equivalent. Sadism comes close, but the sadist gets off on inflicting pain. As Tiffany Watt Smith <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/oct/14/the-secret-joys-of-schadenfreude-why-it-shouldnt-be-a-guilty-pleasure" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote</a> in the <em>Guardian</em>, schadenfreude is a spectator sport. </p>
<p>And who is a better target for schadenfreude right now than Trump? A man who won the presidency by painting Hillary Clinton as a criminal, who spent every day of his presidency punching down on those with the least privilege, who has arguably fostered more division and vitriol than any other figure in my lifetime. Naturally, his defeat, which for a long time seemed impossible, will come with a tasty shot of pure dopamine. </p>
<p>But what happens when that dopamine subsides? Even if Trump goes to prison for the rest of his life, and even if every single one of his allies were to join him there, the world they helped usher won’t immediately disappear. In twenty states, gender-affirming care has been banned for people under the age of eighteen. That situation directly affects more people than Trump’s indictment ever will. The Supreme Court has been stacked with Trump-appointed conservative justices and&mdash;no matter Trump’s fate&mdash;it will likely remain so for the foreseeable future.  </p>
<p>Canadian progressives have their own political opponents. In New Brunswick, Bill Hogan, the minister of education and early childhood development, recently amended a policy so that teachers will no longer need to respect their students’ preferred pronouns, a move that pro-trans advocates lambasted. Alberta premier Danielle Smith, who secured a decisive majority in the election in her province in May, compared vaccinated people to Adolf Hitler’s followers (she later apologized for those comments). <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/quebec/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Quebec</a> premier François Legault also won a comfortable majority after implementing controversial policies like <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/our-national-silence-on-bill-21/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bill 21</a>, which bars people working in public positions from wearing religious garments, and which has most <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bill-21-impact-religious-minorities-survey-1.6541241" rel="noopener" target="_blank">acutely affected</a> Muslim women. Most worrisome of them all is <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/pierre-poilievre/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pierre Poilievre</a>, a hard-core partisan with a populist flair who, based on the latest data, is <a href="https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/pierre-poilievre-s-conservatives-widen-their-lead-over-justin-trudeau-s-liberals-with-vast-majority/article_239eebc7-d0ea-5a80-b921-1e1020583f63.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">leading opinion polls</a>. </p>
<p>It would be easy to take to social media and pine for the downfall of these politicians. But schadenfreude is not progress. Progress, for me, has always been a positive word. It conjures the principle of the good fight. It implies an aspirational desire to do good by others, not a thirst for retribution. Progress is justice for marginalized peoples which, for starters, looks like material reparations. It is an unwavering recognition that what a human can be is fluid, and it’s a commitment to securing equality and equity for all, even if someone’s life experience or identity is different or unfamiliar. For some, it can look like ousting conservatives and voting progressives into power, but electing a certain kind of politician from a certain section of the political spectrum surely offers an inadequate measure of progress.</p>
<p>There is no political capital in schadenfreude. Things can improve if we demand improved treatment from our governments through activism and collective action and vocal criticism and votes, but more lasting change will arise if we cultivate an environment where basic human decency is not up for debate. Progress is rarely as visible and concrete as a court decision. It is slow and difficult to measure but always, even in small ways, in motion. </p>
<p>In June, a San Diego library suddenly found itself out of books to place in its Pride Month display. The mystery soon unravelled: the library received an email from anti-LGBTQ community members who said they had checked out nearly all the queer and trans books from the library. They threatened to hold the books hostage unless the library expelled them from its catalogue. But after the story was reported in the local paper, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/22/us/pride-books-library-protest.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">something wonderful happened</a>. Boxes on boxes full of replacement books arrived at the library, and the system received a $30,000 infusion to buy more <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/lgbtq/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LGBTQ</a> books and expand its queer-friendly programming, including drag queen story hours. Half that money came from individual donations, and the other half came from the city government. </p>
<p>There will always be people dedicated to the cause of intolerance. But it doesn’t seem like a plausible or efficient aim to try and convert or exact revenge on each and every one of them. Let San Diego be a model: we can only move forward if we spend our time and energy and resources drowning hate with love. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-downside-of-celebrating-trumps-legal-woes/">The Downside of Celebrating Trump’s Legal Woes</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

And while Olivia Chow and her team might not describe their victory in Toronto’s mayoral by-election as a cakewalk, the challenges they now face are considerable. As mayor, Chow must navigate a chronically underfunded Toronto while navigating relationships with a divided city council, a Progressive Conservative government in Ontario fond of bullying the province’s cities, a Liberal federal government facing its own challenges, and a progressive community that has big expectations of her. </p>
<p>If you followed the <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/elections/election-results-reports/election-results/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">results</a> on election night, you saw a neck-and-neck race, with Ana Bailão leading for part of the night. By the time counting was over, Chow had pressed ahead with 269,372 votes to Bailão’s 235,175: a margin of victory just under 5 percent&mdash;comfortable, but hardly a blowout. A former city councillor and deputy mayor, Bailão was endorsed by John Tory, whose scandal-induced resignation from the mayoralty launched the by-election in the first place. Bailão has been labelled “a pragmatic centrist,” which describes a heap of Canadian politicians across levels of government. Her campaign made her look like an establishment candidate offering more of the same. And “same,” for skeptics, meant underinvestment in the city and de-prioritization of public space&mdash;hallmarks of the Tory years. Chow wasn’t an establishment candidate; her campaign was premised on a break with that past, arguing in favour of raising revenue, of community engagement, and of a city in which everyone might find themselves at home. </p>

</ul>
<p>That difference could matter. Indeed, it could end up serving the new mayor well. If investments in public infrastructure backed by community buy-in pay off, the city might see results. Better, safer, more frequent transit. Or more affordable homes and people off the street. Accessible and clean public parks and spaces. Trash cans with room for, you know, trash. Saman Tabasinejad, acting executive director of Progress Toronto, a progressive advocacy organization, says Chow has set a high baseline. “With John Tory we had to fight for basic things like opening up the washrooms in parks,” she says. “Whereas now we’re in a different scenario. Advocates have someone who has shown that she listens and meets with activists.”</p>
<p>That different scenario became official on Wednesday, July 12, when Chow rode to City Hall on a bicycle to be sworn in as mayor in a ceremony emceed by actor Jean Yoon. Two days before, Chow called for a review of Ontario’s property assessment system in the wake of a <em><a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/investigations/troubling-property-tax-trend-hitting-toronto-s-cheapest-homes-while-mansions-catch-a-break-star/article_39c30e19-5b6a-52b6-a37c-85430114312a.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Toronto Star</a></em> investigation that found inequities between the richest and poorest owners, with the former not paying their share compared to the latter.</p>
<p>Chow’s win represents a chance to run Toronto differently. She also represents a racialized community that has been shut out of the city’s top office despite making up a sizable portion of its population. She was born to a middle-class family in Hong Kong in 1957 and came to Canada with them in 1970. By 1985, she had entered politics as a school trustee. Later, she became a Toronto city councillor and, after that, a member of Parliament. She ran for mayor of Toronto in 2014 and lost. In 2015, she tried to return to federal politics but lost the election to Liberal Adam Vaughan. The losses did not stop her. But now she faces a bigger challenge than those elections: changing the course of a city that has long been travelling, stubbornly, in the same direction.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smallcaps">uilding a different city</span> means adopting a different way of thinking about cities. It also means a new way of doing business. Tabasinejad believes Chow’s approach of relying on social movements to bolster her mandate while standing up, in plain sight, to other levels of government will work. “One thing that sets Olivia apart from her predecessors is the fact that she’s going to be negotiating in public,” she says. Tory and Bailão were cast as master negotiators with connections, who could work the backrooms and across all levels of government, but Tabasinejad doesn’t buy it. “That’s hogwash,” she argues. “That hasn’t worked.” Backroom deals and backslapping buddy politics will only get you so far. Cozy relationships with elites are one thing, but without public pressure and support from core communities, politicians are all too likely to shy away from making difficult or controversial decisions&mdash;like shifting resources away from police and to community-led, non-policing programs. Moreover, it’s all too easy for politicians in the backroom to accept that what their well-to-do, suited buddies are telling them is the gospel truth.</p>
<p>But to be successful, there’s another key part of her mayoralty that Chow will have to unlock: convincing non-progressives that her break with the Toronto of the past is better for the city’s future. You might look at overflowing garbage cans and transit delays and think the argument is self-evident, but convincing Torontonians to invest in their city&mdash;yes, taxes&mdash;after years of austerity conditioning is a project. Chow faces an entrenched political establishment, and not a few members of that establishment seem convinced her election will bring a Marxist revolution. The Canadian Taxpayers Federation <a href="https://www.taxpayer.com/newsroom/chow-a-threat-to-toronto-taxpayers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">called her a “threat to Toronto taxpayers</a>.” During the race, Ontario premier Doug Ford opposed Chow as a “lefty” mayor, saying her win would be an “<a href="https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/olivia-chow-as-toronto-mayor-would-be-an-unmitigated-disaster-doug-ford-says-1.6450392" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unmitigated disaster</a>” and warning her tenure would drive business away from the city. Tabasinejad says progressives “have to talk to people on the ground” and “create a groundswell movement and dispel people’s fears.” That entails selling Chow’s agenda across the city and putting pressure on city councillors, Premier Ford, and Prime Minister Trudeau to get on board. </p>
<p>Within days of winning the election, Chow faced her first skirmish with the province over the Ford government’s Ontario Place project. The redevelopment, which will span twelve acres, includes an upscale spa, an expanded entertainment facility, and a massive parking garage to go with it. Toronto city officials said some of the design “overwhelms the public realm” and “prioritizes private uses” by limiting access to the waterfront to those willing to pay. Chow is fighting for that public realm, but the Ford government has played what it likely thinks is a checkmate. “If an agreement to transfer the City of Toronto-owned water or lands to the Government of Ontario is not reached, expropriation will be required,&#8221; says a report prepared for the government’s environmental assessment of the project. In short, the Ford government needs the space to redevelop, and it will get it, one way or another&mdash;even if it has to force the city to give it up.</p>
<p>The Ontario Place redevelopment seems an ideal issue for Chow to take a stand on. She ran on a promise to “keep Ontario Place public,” and she’s sticking to that promise. She must. Her vision for the city is premised on inclusion, which means maximum public space, accessible and open to everyone.</p>
<p>Asked about the environmental assessment report, she said she’d take the Ford government to court if they try to seize city land. “Hopefully we don’t get to a stage where we have two levels of government seeing each other in court,” she said, noting that the option was “available.” </p>
<p>Will that work? We’ll see. The struggle over Ontario Place may serve as a study of how Chow will balance movement building, conciliation, and fighting. There’s no way she can please everyone. Such is the nature of governing. The question is whether she can choose her battles wisely over the next three years, capitalize on social movement support, and deliver structural change on the city’s political priorities. But struggle is something left-wing progressives are used to. What they’re less used to is winning.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/olivia-chow-election/">Olivia Chow Won the Battle for Toronto.

		<description><![CDATA[Why are voters in Canada’s biggest city treated like they can’t make their own democratic decisions?]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="1320" src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Miller_TorontoDemocracy_1200.jpeg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="A photograph of Toronto City Hall." loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="" /><p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n 1998</span>, the Ontario government, led by the Progressive Conservative premier Mike Harris, amalgamated the then city of <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/Toronto/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Toronto</a>, its neighbours of Scarborough, North York, East York, York, and Etobicoke, and the regional government (Metropolitan Toronto) against the will of the elected governments and the residents. In a referendum, voters in all of the municipalities voted overwhelmingly <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/torontos-struggle-against-amalgamation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">against amalgamation</a>, but it proceeded nonetheless. The courts upheld the legislation despite legal challenges, essentially ruling that the province, because it has the legal ability to legislate over municipalities, had the authority to impose an amalgamation against the will of the residents and the people elected by them.</p>
<p>Amalgamation was a double-edged sword: on the one hand, its very size risked the existing tradition of robust engagement with residents; on the other, it empowered the city government and the office of mayor with a tremendous platform&mdash;speaking for about 2.3 million residents&mdash;a population not only bigger than that of most Canadian provinces but only a little smaller than the then populations of Alberta and British Columbia.</p>
<p>Since the amalgamation, cities around the world have risen in influence and power. Starting in about 2007, due in part to the explosive growth of megacities in China and a migration to cities in many regions across the globe, more people now live in urban areas than rural. For the first time in human history, the world has become predominantly urban. <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/urbandevelopment/overview#" rel="noopener" target="_blank">According to the World Bank</a>, cities are where the bulk of economic activity happens: they generate over 80 percent of global GDP.</p>

<li><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/how-toronto-lost-its-groove/">How Toronto Lost Its Groove</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Over the past fifteen years or so, city governments have asserted their influence internationally over a range of issues: on climate change, health, migration, and diplomacy, to name just a few. They can do this, and be remarkably effective, not just because they have a strong voice but because they, as an order of government, largely have a powerful combination of delivering real services and a practice of strong engagement with their residents. They are globally powerful precisely because they are effective and democratic local governments.</p>
<p>In Toronto’s case, though, despite the size of the city, voters are treated as if they do not have the ability or the right to make democratic decisions about their own governance. Not only is this alarmingly anti-democratic but it goes against trends around the world, where a new era of strong cities is leading change. </p>
<p>Toronto is sadly moving in the opposite direction. What would it take to bring the city back?</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smallcaps">ver the past five years</span>, successive provincial legislation, enabled by a largely compliant mayor, has diminished the stature of Canada’s largest city and the ability of its residents to democratically participate in its governance&mdash;all without their consent or participation in any way. This, to me, was an assault on civic democracy. When he was still mayor, John Tory admitted meeting privately with the premier to raise these changes, which meant reducing public representation, assuming veto powers, and asking for and receiving minority rule&mdash;all of which shrinks the influence of citizens on the decisions affecting them and their communities.</p>
<p>And by effectively surrendering to the provincial government the ability to make strategic decisions&mdash;like where to locate new rapid transit lines&mdash;he has dramatically diminished the city’s role and influence. In February, Tory <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/john-tory-final-day-mayor-1.6751834#" rel="noopener" target="_blank">resigned</a> in disgrace over his affair with a staffer. His legacy is the voluntary reduction of the power and influence of the City of Toronto&mdash;and a corresponding diminution of the ability of its residents to meaningfully participate in the life of the city. The forthcoming by-election for mayor of Toronto will determine whether the office is held by someone who understands and acts on these key principles&mdash;or not.</p>
<p>In 2008, during my second term as mayor, I was elected by my international peers to be the chair of C40 Cities, a coalition of the mayors of major cities working together to help the world avoid climate breakdown. In 2016, the group committed to doing its fair share to keep the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees at a time when national governments were congratulating themselves on the Paris Agreement, which agreed to a weaker target of 2 degrees. C40 isn’t alone; inspired by the writing of Benjamin R. Barber (<em>If Mayors Ruled the World</em>), the Global Parliament of Mayors held its first meeting in 2016, and the Mayors Migration Council launched in 2018. Writing in <em>Foreign Policy</em> in 2021, Nina Hachigian, then deputy mayor of international relations for Los Angeles, said the following about the growing role of cities on the international stage:</p>
<blockquote><p>It may come as a surprise to some, but state and local governments interact with the world outside U.S. borders in many more ways than in the past. Local leaders are the actual boots on the ground when transnational threats hit U.S. shores, setting pandemic rules, distributing vaccines, coping with extreme weather, and caring for migrants. Local governments have become key national security actors.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Their direct role in foreign policy has also been growing. For example, U.S. local leaders regularly nurture relationships with foreign governments. In any given week in Los Angeles, where I am the deputy mayor for international affairs, Mayor Eric Garcetti could be speaking with his counterparts in Tokyo, Jakarta, or Mexico City, the ambassadors of India or France, or the secretary-general of the United Nations. Before the pandemic, Los Angeles hosted heads of state and government ministers on a regular basis. Of course, these relationships do not define the contours of national ones, but the sum total of local ties&mdash;involving government, civil society, business, and countless individual people&mdash;is a critical stabilizer. In a democracy, especially one with a federal, decentralized system, these ties create the political space for closer relations or, in some cases, frostier ones.</p></blockquote>
<p>While she was writing from an American perspective, the age of cities is a global phenomenon. Although this trend has been empowered by increased urbanization, there is also a subtler reason for the growth of cities on the world stage: the basic form and structure of this order of government. While responsibilities vary globally, cities generally must deliver real services&mdash;not just policies&mdash;and have a strong connection to their residents. Healthy and vibrant local democracies include a variety of required and voluntary ways to engage with residents, and many resident-driven organizations work with City Hall. These interactions create a sense of connection between people and their local government and, at their best, ensure that the services the government delivers meet the needs of its residents as expressed by them.</p>
<p>In Toronto’s case, the services provided by the city are broad and touch virtually every aspect of daily life, except for hospitals and education. The city runs social services for people&mdash;like child care, recreation, and youth programmes. It provides income support and housing&mdash;and in fact is Canada’s biggest landlord. And much, much more: public health, public safety through fire, police and paramedics, public transit, libraries, parks, trees, environment, clean water, electricity, small business supports, roads, and transportation. And, of course, planning, which decides where, what type of, and often how new buildings can be built.  </p>
<p>Traditionally, there has been a strong sense of civic engagement in Toronto&mdash;and a willingness in council to listen to residents through robust public-engagement processes and lively debates. It was this engagement that stopped the Spadina Expressway coming into the downtown; that convinced the Toronto Transit Commission to retain its streetcar lines; that protected Rouge Park, now North America’s largest urban park; and brought back the Don River, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/toronto-don-river-roars-back-to-life" rel="noopener" target="_blank">declared dead in 1969</a>&mdash;all thanks to a strong, engaged citizenry.</p>
<p>The heft of the new megacity also enabled Toronto, in partnership with other Canadian cities, to take a leadership role in building the “New Deal for Cities” with the Paul Martin government in 2005&mdash;a deal that resulted in billions of dollars in funding for transit and housing in Toronto, and if his government had not fallen, it likely would have resulted in a tripartite agreement between Toronto, Queen’s Park, and Ottawa about a variety of issues that would have empowered the Toronto government. Together with the City of Toronto Act in 2006, there was a recognition of the significance of the city government and of the rights of its residents to not only vote but to determine important issues themselves through the representatives they democratically elected&mdash;issues like the number of city wards, their size, and, therefore, the number of councillors.</p>
<p>As it was, the federal funding (accompanied by significant agreements reached with the province and new revenue sources permitted by the City of Toronto Act) helped transform Toronto’s ability to provide services. For example, transit service increased dramatically and, by 2010, ridership was setting new single-day records. The TTC also began construction on an ambitious expansion plan crafted by the city, based on its own assessments of where transit is needed most. </p>
<p>Is it possible to demonstrate academically the direct line between democratic accountability and the engagement of residents? Possibly. But the contrast with today is clear.</p>
<p>In many ways, Toronto appears broken because basic services have been starved for years. In 2018, the reduction in the number of council wards in Ontario from forty-five to twenty-five gave the city’s nearly 3 million residents less representation. The new “<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-strong-mayor-1.6576122" rel="noopener" target="_blank">strong mayor</a>” powers from the province&mdash;which give the mayor the authority to veto certain bylaws and to table the budget, instead of the council doing so&mdash;also came into effect. The failure to grow the tax base has resulted in the service cuts that have been the object of so much public concern. Together with the impacts of <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COVID-19</a>&mdash;meaning, a decrease in TTC ridership (and, therefore, revenue)&mdash;have resulted in a roughly $1 billion deficit in Toronto. It’s all resulted in disengaged citizens and made the city weaker.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he course</span> can be changed. Broadly speaking, it will require both council and the next mayor to show political fortitude and a recognition that their role, particularly for the mayor, is to fight for the best interests of Toronto’s residents&mdash;not through backroom deals but very much in public view.</p>
<p>Residents have a right to a real say over the policies, services, and actions that affect them and their communities. Initiatives like Listening to Toronto (a series of pre-budget community-engagement events that I instituted in my time as mayor), participatory budgeting (in which residents help determine how to allocate public funds), and providing responsive city services through measures like 311 all are a place to start, as was the 2016 broad public consultation about ward boundaries, in which people demanded more representation, not less.</p>
<p>The mayor and council need to develop plans to address the needs of the residents of Toronto. From transit and active transportation to planning, housing, homelessness, and much more, the needs of Torontonians are best met when the city sets out the plan and forces the province and Ottawa to respond rather than when the city passively accepts their mandates.</p>
<p>And by bringing together coalitions of mayors and the cities they lead provincially and nationally, Toronto, in the past, has helped change federal and provincial policies and funding significantly, delivering billions of dollars in investments to the people of this city. A coalition of leading cities is far more powerful than the voice of one mayor or council, particularly when that coalition is focused on a small number of common goals&mdash;which, in my experience, is no more than three. This was how the New Deal for Cities was crafted: in partnership with Ottawa and with cities and towns, large and small, but driven by the largest Canadian cities.  </p>
<p>Today, a government unable to afford the services its residents expect has time only to focus inward, not to rebuild the connections with local residents lost through legislation for which no one had a mandate, certainly not from Torontonians. It is a loss at home. A loss nationally. And a loss for the world. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/city-diminished-the-shrinking-power-and-influence-of-toronto/">City Diminished: The Shrinking Power and Influence of Toronto</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

From time to time, a seat will become vacant between general elections&mdash;members resign or die&mdash;and an election is required within six months to fill it. In a legislature with 338 seats and a country with a voracious pundit class and deep roster of political operatives, the occasional ad hoc electoral contest becomes a chessboard on which players battle over the future of the nation. It all sounds grand and very important, but typically, the races themselves mean little for law, policy, or the next general election. They do, however, shape perceptions and drive the way we think and talk about parties and their leaders. They give parties a chance to trial and experiment with electoral strategies. Of course, they also return members of Parliament to constituents, but that fact tends to get lost in the melee. </p>
<p>On June 19, by-elections were held to fill four House of Commons seats. Perhaps above all, the races were framed as the first electoral test for Pierre Poilievre. As the new leader of the Conservative Party, elected in September 2022, Poilievre was in the spotlight. From the beginning, he was, by design, a polarizing figure. He ran for the leadership the same way he’s run the Conservative Party since becoming leader&mdash;in the style of a right-wing YouTuber, elbows up, keen to smash norms and bite like a rabid bulldog. He has balanced working-class outreach&mdash;by way of talking about inflation, affordability, and housing policy&mdash;with social and cultural sorties on drug policy and the so-called “woke” agenda. </p>

<li><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/pierre-poilievre-the-secret-to-his-success/">Pierre Poilievre: The Secret to His Success</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For his efforts, spring and summer polls and projections have had his party neck and neck with&mdash;sometimes ahead, sometimes just behind&mdash;Prime Minister <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/justin-trudeau/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Justin Trudeau</a> and the governing Liberal Party, which is accumulating its share of baggage after nearly eight years in power. Under Trudeau, the Liberals have managed some feats&mdash;the Canada child benefit, carbon pricing, successful COVID-19 vaccine procurement&mdash;but have fallen into scandals and failures, from abandoning electoral reform to SNC-Lavalin corruption allegations and a contested bill on internet-streaming regulation. </p>
<p>Under Poilievre, the Conservatives are projected to be well within government-forming distance, according to the polls. But the last two Conservative Party leaders weren’t far off themselves. Both Andrew Scheer in 2019 and Erin O’Toole in 2021 managed to win more votes than Justin Trudeau in their respective federal elections. But aggregate popular vote doesn’t determine outcomes in Canadian elections. Seat count does.</p>
<p>One of the oldest lines in politics is that “governments defeat themselves.” Governments get long in the tooth, complacent, arrogant. Voters get sick of them and look to the opposition to replace them. It’s like a home renovation: “I’m so sick of that tile.” It’s true that governments defeat themselves&mdash;but only if opposition parties don’t beat <em>themselves</em> first. We can draw some tentative conclusions from Monday’s races, but the trick with by-elections is not to draw too many firm conclusions from them. A handful of elections do not necessarily serve as a predictor of what’s to come in a general election. We don’t know when the next federal election will be&mdash;it could come as late as fall 2025&mdash;but we do know, when it does come, there will be 338 elections at once. By comparison, four by-elections are a drop in the bucket. We can, however, look at each by-election and ask how parties fared against expectations and history. </p>
<p>Each of the four seats up for grabs on Monday were safe seats. They were held equally by the Liberals and Conservatives: two each. In the 2021 general election, Jim Carr won Winnipeg South Centre by nearly eighteen percentage points over his Conservative Party competitor. In Notre-Dame-de-Grâce&mdash;Westmount, Liberal Marc Garneau broke the 50 percent threshold, winning the seat with almost thirty-five percentage points over the New Democratic Party second-place finisher. In Portage-Lisgar, Conservative Candice Bergen fared nearly as well, taking 52.5 percent of the ballots&mdash;and she would have done better had it not been for the second-place finisher of the People’s Party of Canada. In Oxford, Ontario Dave MacKenzie won with 47 percent, well ahead of the Liberal candidate, who finished with 20.5 percent.</p>
<p>As results rolled in on Monday night, it was clear early on that the Liberals and Conservatives would both keep the seats they’d gone into the by-elections with. Don’t be tempted to conclude too much from this beyond the fact that safe seats that were expected to remain safe seats stayed&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;safe. By-elections tend to be an unrepresentative sample of the country and a mere snapshot in time. And these four races were no different. There may be some side stories here and there&mdash;for instance, the Greens and their deputy leader, Jonathan Pedneault, had a good night in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce&mdash;Westmount. In 2021, the Greens finished fifth in the riding, with just 4 percent of the vote. This time around, they finished fourth, with over 13 percent and within 100 votes of second place.</p>
<p>Of the contests, it was Portage-Lisgar that was the most interesting&mdash;for all the wrong reasons. There, People’s Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier was vying for a seat in Parliament after three losses in a row, courting social conservatives by promising to ban some abortions and oppose “evil” transgender-inclusive policies. Throughout the campaign, the Conservatives and the far-right PPC were at each other’s throats, struggling over the same voter base and the definition of who counts as right-wing. Unsympathetic observers might be inclined to say, “Let them fight”; a fractured right duking it out, depleting resources and tarnishing reputations, is all the better for the centre and left. But Poilievre’s cynical attempt to tie the PPC leader to the World Economic Forum&mdash;which holds an annual conference in Davos, Switzerland, villainous to many conservatives&mdash;and cast Bernier as a shill in the pocket of the elites who secretly dictate global affairs was reminiscent of conspiracy mongering and right-wing extremism. For his part, Bernier cast his Tory opponent as a fake conservative.</p>
<p>If the next general election features more conspiracy theory&ndash;driven battles over who is a “true” conservative as the CPC moves to protect its right flank, worried that it might lose conservative base voters to the PPC, political discourse in Canada could become even nastier than it already is. Of course, there’s also the chance that this loss&mdash;this utter shellacking&mdash;buries Bernier and his lot once and for all. Bernier indicated that he’s sticking around and he’ll run in Portage-Lisgar again in the next election.</p>
<p>Now that the by-elections are over, parties and their surrogates will battle over what they mean&mdash;drawing outsized conclusions and spinning them for the media and the public. Try to ignore them and don’t fall for their tricks. What’s more important than spinning half truths and full lies is that, behind the scenes, parties will evaluate what worked and what didn’t work in anticipation of the next general election.</p>
<p>There will be at least one more by-election&mdash;in <a href="https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=med&#038;dir=pre&#038;document=jan0523&#038;lang=e" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Calgary Heritage</a>, a <a href="https://www.elections.ca/res/rep/off/ovr2021app/53/11876e.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">safe Conservative seat</a>&mdash;before the next general election. Trudeau has called it for <a href="https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2023/06/18/prime-minister-announces-election-calgary-heritage" rel="noopener" target="_blank">July 24</a>. That means we’ll do this again soon, barring a sudden, unlikely general election call. Whether party fortunes or strategies change between now and then depends little on the four elections just held, with the possible exception of some bad lessons from Portage-Lisgar, but that won’t stop the usual suspects from doing their best to convince you otherwise.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/pierre-poilievre-by-election/">Did Pierre Poilievre Pass His First Test?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p><span class="dropcap">&#8220;I</span><span class="smallcaps">nside the Senate</span> you can already see [the] presence of an Inuk Elder who is getting ready to light the qulliq,” Rosemary Barton, CBC chief political correspondent, told viewers on July 26, 2021.</p>
<p>The black and yellow news ticker at the bottom of the screen announced that Mary Simon would be installed as Canada’s first ever Indigenous governor general. “[The qulliq] is a traditional Inuit oil lamp that was used to sometimes warm the home, warm the igloo,” continued Barton, doing her best to describe something that most Canadians had probably never seen. The network cut to a shot of Inuk Elder Sally Webster inside the Senate chamber, striking a match on a red box and lighting the oil. “Oh! There it’s happening right as I speak, look at that,” said Barton.</p>

<p>Spread atop a nearby table were a few official documents and four medals. Each medal signifies an Order, a ceremonial office&mdash;the Order of Canada, say, or the Order of Military Merit&mdash;to which Simon would be inducted so she could carry out her responsibilities as the Crown’s representative in Canada. The display reminded me of the way at.óow, or sacred regalia, is set before witnesses at a Tlingit potlatch, or the way wampum treaty belts and gustoweh feather headdresses are laid at the front of a longhouse before the Haudenosaunee recite Kayanerenkó:wa, their <a href="https://oneida-nsn.gov/our-ways/our-story/great-law-of-peace/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Great Law of Peace</a>. But of all the symbols endowed with special significance that day, it was the qulliq that stood out. And, boy, did Barton want to get her pronunciation right. “The qulliq, as it’s called,” she said. “I would imagine the very first time it’s been lit here, too, inside the Senate.”</p>
<p>At the head of the state, the tippy top, above the clamour of parliamentarians, premiers, and prime ministers&mdash;in fact, above all politicians and their policies&mdash;sits tradition. In Canada, as in the other commonwealth offspring of the British empire, the Crown is the sovereign. Appointed by the Crown, the governor general is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and constitutional head of state. Though the role is apolitical, the governor general can offer counsel to the prime minister. They bestow honours like the Order of Canada on worthy citizens. And they convene politicians and Canadians at home and abroad, setting the table for conversations that shape Canadian civic culture and identity.</p>
<p>The governor general is one of the oldest colonial institutions in North America and can be traced back to the early seventeeth century, and to the first governor of New France. After the British defeated the French in the Seven Years’ War, English governors assumed the office. The role was mandated during Confederation. A Canadian-born governor general, however, was not appointed for almost 300 years, until 1952, during the disintegration of the British empire. Seven years after that, the first French Canadian was sworn in.</p>
<p>Ever since, there has been an unofficial policy of alternating between anglophone and francophone heads of state. The idea is that, above the tensions of Canadian society&mdash;between English and French, Liberals and Conservatives, settlers and Indigenous&mdash;there is a common symbol, institution, and office that’s not mired in politics or policy. While the republic to Canada’s south wages cultural battles verging on civil war, the prevailing Canadian political philosophy is that “peace, order and good government” are achieved, in part, by keeping the Crown, represented by the governor general, above the fracas. That’s the Canadian way. But that’s not the tradition this story is about.</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n May 2021</span>, ground-penetrating radar detected more than 200 potential unmarked graves of children in an apple orchard beside the former <a href="https://tkemlups.ca/kirs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kamloops Indian Residential School</a>, where my kyé7e (“kya-ah,” grandmother) completed high school. The discovery exposed the crimes underlying a nation built on land taken from Indigenous peoples&mdash;systemic abuse, assault, rape, even murder&mdash;and reinforced the need for a national reckoning. Makeshift memorials sprung up across the country. People took to the streets. Institutions named after the architects of cultural genocide changed their nomenclature. Statues fell. Churches were vandalized. Some even burned. And as more <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/first-nations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">First Nations</a> initiated their own investigations, the potential number of child-sized graves climbed into the thousands.</p>
<p>Less than two months after the discovery at Kamloops, Prime Minister <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/justin-trudeau/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Justin Trudeau</a> called Inuk leader and former Canadian diplomat Mary Jeannie May Simon to offer her a job. Canada has had four women (two of them refugees) and dozens of white men serve as governor general for a term that usually lasts five years. But there had never been an Indigenous person appointed. (New Zealand, another former settler colony of the British empire, has had three Māori governors general.)</p>
<p>Simon’s path to that role was unlike any walked by a governor general before. Like all Inuit born between 1941 and 1978, she was given a loonie-sized red metal disc as a form of identification when she was a child. It had an intricate picture of a crown on one side and her ID number on the other. Simon’s parents&mdash;her father a white store manager and her mother an Inuk woman&mdash;were not allowed to marry according to the policies of her father’s employer, the Hudson’s Bay Company. Canada took many of Simon’s community members from loving homes to <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/residential-schools/">residential schools</a>. During World War II, Canada appropriated Inuit land for military bases and natural resources. In the 1950s and ’60s, Canada used relocated Inuit bodies and communities to lay claim to the far north in its tussle against other world powers. When those same world powers met to make decisions that would impact Inuit land, water, and life in the ’80s and ’90s, they did not initially give Inuit a seat at the table. Today, Inuit are one of the only linguistic groups in the world who constitute a majority in their region but cannot access social services in their primary language, Inuktut. Canada and the Crown have wronged them many times.</p>
<p>Simon spent much of her career fighting those wrongs. “I’ve been working on Indigenous rights for forty-seven years,” Simon told me. “I am first and foremost an Inuk.” And hers was often a winning fight. Unlike many other Indigenous peoples, Inuit held on to much of their territory, language, and culture. And when qallunaat (“ha-loo-not,” or colonizers) tried to take these, Inuit took the qallunaat on in their qallunaat courts, qallunaat negotiating rooms, and qallunaat parliament. In the ’70s, Inuit and their Cree neighbours stood up to Quebec and said that the province could not build an enormous complex of hydroelectric dams, which would permanently flood their lands along James Bay, without dealing with Indigenous peoples first. Their collective stand halted construction for a time and compelled the province to sign what is sometimes called the first “modern treaty,” in 1975. The agreement marked the end of the days when qallunaat could bulldoze Indigenous lands and peoples before we’d had our say. Simon cut her teeth on those negotiations. There aren’t many history books that tell the story of Simon and the Inuit movement. Indigenous history of any kind&mdash;the tragic or the triumphant&mdash;doesn’t get much ink. But if you check the record, you’ll see that at almost every turn, Mary Simon was there.</p>
<p>Her installation ceremony was held in the same building that, forty years earlier, was the main staging ground for negotiating the patriation of Canada’s Constitution from the British. As a member of the Inuit Committee on National Issues, Simon was one of the people who made sure Inuit specifically and Indigenous peoples collectively had our rights ensconced in the Constitution. (Today, there’s an Indigenous streetwear brand, Section 35, named for the clause that affirms those rights.) In one of the committee’s meetings with then prime minister Pierre Trudeau, held in March 1984, she insisted that gender and sexual equality for Indigenous women needed to be explicitly protected. Indigenous women&mdash;including her own mother&mdash;had lost their native status due to a provision in the Indian Act that stated a native woman who married a non-native man forfeited her native status. Trudeau disagreed, arguing that gender and sexual equality had already been addressed in the Constitution. The exchange stands out as one of the most significant, if overlooked, moments in Canadian feminist history. </p>
<p>“I wish you and your sisters would take it out of your head that somehow we are deliberately trying to frustrate the concept of equality. At least, in the law, everyone has assured you here that we are not,” Trudeau intoned, with an incredulity that bordered on condescension. Between sentences, he sucked the temple tip of his eyeglasses while he tried to set his argument straight. “You know, in a sense, you’re equal when you think you’re equal. And if you think you are unequal, the law won’t change much.” </p>
<p>“Mr. Prime Minister, I consider myself an equal,” responded Simon without batting an eye. “I am an Aboriginal representative who represents both male and female persons in Northern Quebec. I have always tried to be very unbiased towards whom I represent because I feel that, as people, we have one interest, and that is our collective and individual rights. And all I’m saying here is, as someone who represents both sides, I would like to see the equality clause once and for all settled.” She was on the winning side of that fight too. In 1985, the Indian Act was amended so that Indigenous women kept their status when marrying a non-native. Furthermore, women who married prior to the amendment could regain their status. </p>
<p>But Simon’s battles did not stop at the national level. In the 1990s, she outmanoeuvred American diplomats to win Inuit and other <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/arctic/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arctic</a> Indigenous peoples permanent seats on the Arctic Council, a multinational forum comprised of states and Indigenous peoples in the region. The Arctic Council is today the only international forum where Indigenous peoples sit at the same table as nation states. Step by step, Simon and other Inuit have crafted one of the greatest political traditions of any Indigenous or minority group in the world. “I knew Mary Simon before I actually met Mary Simon,” said <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/becoming-natan-obed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Natan Obed</a>, the president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, a national organization that represents 65,000 Inuit across Inuit Nunangat&mdash;Inuit homelands in Canada. He describes Simon as a leader with “a certain kind of power” rooted in grace, empathy, and presence. “She has been confident and poised in the face of colonial racism and the attitudes that Canadian politicians, including prime ministers of the day, had towards Indigenous peoples and especially Indigenous women,” said Obed.</p>

<p>That’s who Justin Trudeau called and asked to come to the other side of the table and help&mdash;as the Crown’s representative&mdash;his nation atone for its sins. Standing in the same room where she out-debated and out-negotiated prime ministers, the new governor general introduced herself in her mother tongue, a language where soft consonants catch supple vowels in the palate. “I was born Mary Jeannie May in Arctic Quebec, now known as Nunavik. My Inuk name is Ningiukudluk,” declared Her Excellency, who wore a stately black dress adorned with elegant floral designs beaded by Inuk artist Julie Grenier. Floral patterns and beads both arrived with the French in North America, where Indigenous peoples made them into enduring art. Then she looked at Trudeau. “And, prime minister, it means ‘bossy little old lady.’”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">R</span><span class="smallcaps">ideau Hall</span>, the governor general’s residence in Ottawa, is effectively a modest English-style palace. Fanning out across almost eighty acres in the affluent New Edinburgh neighbourhood, the estate is larger than some of the tracts of reserve land held by my First Nation, the Canim Lake Band, where houses are scarce and unpalatial. At Rideau Hall, there’s a rose garden, a cricket pitch, and, of course, an outdoor hockey rink in the winter. The hall is named after the nearby canal built to help fortify Canada against the threat of American invasion after the War of 1812. The walkway up to the Queen’s Entrance on the west side of the grounds is lined with trees and art. One piece, in particular, caught my eye&mdash;a carved cedar pole depicting a man holding a salmon above the two-headed serpent known as sisiutl and topped by a thunderbird, the mythic avian who shoots lightning from his eyes, flaps thunder from his wings, and fishes whales from the sea. The piece was carved by Mungo Martin, the Kwakwaka’wakw Michelangelo who played a leading role in the twentieth-century renaissance of Northwest Coast art. With its imperial history and Indigenous treasures, Rideau Hall feels like the setting for a <em>Get Out</em>-style Indigenous psychological horror film. It’s spooky.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth II had died a week before I visited. Her body lay in state on the other side of the Atlantic, in London’s Westminster Hall. At Rideau Hall, Canadians were encouraged to come and pay their respects, but few did. In front of the hall, there was a place to leave flowers and a book where mourners could pen their well wishes for the deceased monarch more than 5,000 kilometres away. My people travel great distances for funerals. After a death, we sit with the bodies of our kin for four days. A big wake is a sign of honour and respect. But as I approached the Queen’s Entrance, the grounds of the Crown’s Ottawa estate felt vast and empty. An Ipsos poll taken after the queen’s death <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/news-polls/canadians-conflicted-on-future-role-of-monarchy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">found that</a> 54 percent of Canadians believed their nation should sever formal ties with the monarchy. Anti-Crown sentiment has grown 10 percent since 2011, according to the research firm. Though I count myself among this growing disaffected majority, I still signed Her Majesty’s condolence book. “Me7 yecwmenstsut-k Kukpi7 Elizabeth,” I wrote in a language the Crown tried to scrub from my kyé7e’s tongue. It means: “You take care, Queen (Chief) Elizabeth.”</p>
<p>As I was departing, I spotted two men wearing Métis woven sashes and black vests beaded with golden vines of pastel-coloured flowers. The elder was Clément Chartier, ambassador of the Manitoba Métis Federation and someone who had advocated alongside Simon for the constitutional protection of Indigenous rights. Chartier was accompanied by Will Goodon, a cabinet minister of the Manitoba Métis. I asked the men if they were there to mourn the queen. “Us?” responded Chartier. “She stole our land!”</p>
<p>He was only half joking. The 1870 Manitoba Act promised Métis land on their native Red River. But the Crown reneged. In 1873 and 1874, Parliament revised the Manitoba Act eleven times to make it more difficult for Métis to exercise legal claims to land. Many Métis were also illiterate, making them more likely to fall through the cracks in nineteenth-century frontier bureaucracy and become targets for con men. The dispossession of Métis led to the North-West Resistance, during which Louis Riel, a Métis leader, founder of Manitoba, and Catholic revisionist prophet, led his people in an armed uprising against Canada. Riel’s people didn’t get their land back, but over time, Manitoba Métis land claims slogged their way through the judiciary. In 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government had not lived up to the honour of the Crown. Despite that, the Manitoba Métis are still without their land. </p>
<p>In his years as president of the Métis Nation-Saskatchewan, Chartier refused to attend events hosted by the governor general. In his younger years, he was a rabble rouser. He knew Secwépemc Chief George Manuel, the second president of the National Indian Brotherhood, and says he was close to George’s activist son, Art. This was the heyday of the Red Power movement for native sovereignty. In 1973, a young Chartier and Art Manuel occupied the Department of Indian Affairs building in Ottawa for twenty-four hours. But like George Manuel, who accepted the Order of Canada from the governor general before his death, Chartier eventually came around to the benefits of working with the Crown. In the 2000s, he met with Michaëlle Jean, a Haitian Canadian who was the first Black governor general. In 2009, the then governor general hosted an event at Rideau Hall to inaugurate the work of the <a href="https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1450124405592/1529106060525" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a>. A few years after that, Chartier met the queen. “As I went along, I started feeling more a part of Canada and realized, if we were going to make headway, we would have to participate in these institutions,” Chartier explained. “The governor general is part of that.”</p>
<p class="pull-quote">Though Indigenous peoples were mistreated by the Crown, a divorce from the monarchy would throw our rights into legal limbo.</p>
<p>Goodon, who is from the Turtle Mountains in Manitoba, respects Chartier’s more accommodating view but questions the need for the monarchy. He remembers how his father, a trapper who worked and lived in the bush, had to pay the Crown royalties for his pelts. National boundaries negotiated by faraway representatives of the Crown disrupted Métis life on the land. “What is the purpose of it?” he asked, rhetorically, of the monarchy. “I don’t know how it’s compatible with actual tenets of democracy.”</p>
<p>These are the tensions at the heart of Indigenous&ndash;Crown relations. On the one hand, laws like the Royal Proclamation of 1763 as well as treaties and land claims negotiated with the Crown (and often not with the Canadian government of the day) are the basis for Indigenous rights and title in Canadian law. In fact, the Royal Proclamation issued by King George III is sometimes called the Indian Magna Carta. But the taking of land, children, and human life was also carried out in the name of the Crown. The central premise of reconciliation is that these wrongs, which played out across centuries and a continent, and which Canada’s own Truth and Reconciliation Commission deemed a “cultural genocide,” can be made right. But reasonable people might ask whether the Crown has ever had any honour and whether an institution that is definitionally undemocratic and imperial can meaningfully decolonize.</p>
<p>These are intractable questions. It would be challenging, if not impossible, for Canada to sever ties with the Crown. The House of Commons, Senate, all ten provinces, and hundreds of Indigenous communities would each have to give their consent for such a break. And of these parties, First Nations would likely be the hardest to convince. Though Indigenous peoples were mistreated by the Crown, a divorce from the monarchy would throw our rights into legal limbo. After the passing of the queen, the Assembly of First Nations, the national body representing Indian bands like my own, expressed condolences to the royal family and reiterated the value we place on the “sacred Treaty relationship with the British Crown.” While decolonization elsewhere meant colonists had to give up their colonies and colonial institutions, in Canada, the Crown and Indigenous peoples are stuck with one another.</p>
<p>The appointment of the first Indigenous governor general has deepened these colonial entanglements. “It is both wonderful and confusing,” Obed told me when we met at his office in downtown Ottawa. “It is such a great thing to have optimism and hope, especially in a party that has wronged you. But, at the same time, there is that other side of it where there is justifiable anger towards these institutions.”</p>
<p>It feels like a trap. On the one hand, of course you should go into the broken institution that harms our people and fix it. On the other hand, it’s a broken institution that harms our people.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thewalrus.ca/who-we-are-now/"><img style="width: 100%;" src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/20th-banner-in-article-horizontal.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he shortwave radio</span> buzzed and crackled as Jeannie Angnatuk twisted the dial to try to bring in the station. As we learn from Simon’s selected lectures, <em>Inuit: One Future&mdash;One Arctic</em>, Jeannie was her maternal grandmother. Simon carries her first name as a middle name. The radio belonged to Bob May, Simon’s father, the manager of the local Hudson’s Bay Company trading post. Though they lived in a tent deep in the bush near the Koksoak River, which drains into Ungava Bay on the north shore of Quebec, Angnatuk could sometimes catch the BBC. The static dimmed and the broadcast came in. I imagine Angnatuk recognized the familiar sound of Inuit music immediately: singing, likely accompanied by the hollow tik-tik, tik-tik of a stick on the wooden frame of a qilaut (drum). Maybe it was a song about migrating geese or a successful caribou hunt, or maybe it was a simple lullaby. Whatever it was, it was beautiful.</p>
<p>Angnatuk called outside to her grandchildren, the offspring of Bob May and Nancy Angnatuk-Askew. Simon was the oldest of four girls and the second oldest of eight siblings. Her grandmother taught them about Inuit culture and history. Simon knew to heed her call. “You have to listen to this,” Angnatuk told her family in Inuktitut as they huddled around the radio. “These are our relatives who live in faraway lands.” The singers came from a place called Akukituk, the Inuktitut word for Greenland. Inuit were all one people, explained Angnatuk, and they were going to be united someday.</p>
<p>About 1,000 years ago, the ancestors of Inuit spread out across the Arctic. They travelled by the stars, fished Arctic char with three-pronged spears called kakivak, and hunted walrus, seals, polar bears, and even bowhead whales, which can weigh as much as 54.4 tonnes, with bows, spears, and harpoons. They designed some of the warmest clothes in the world and perfected the kayak. Eventually, they reached Greenland, where they discovered the Vikings. The Vikings called Inuit “skraeling,” or “wretched,” same as the other natives they encountered. Norse and Inuit coexisted for centuries, possibly until the medieval warm period ended, but the former’s culture was not as well suited to the cold as that of Inuit. Most begin the story of colonization with Columbus in 1492, but in the first encounter between colonists and Indigenous peoples on the North American continent, it was actually Inuit who prevailed and Europeans who mysteriously disappeared, by 1450. Years later, Simon would say it was her grandmother’s dream, inspired by the voices of Greenlandic Inuit, that inspired her own work. </p>
<p>Simon was born in 1947 in Kangiqsualujjuaq, Quebec. Bob and Nancy raised their children with Jeannie in what was then Fort-Chimo and is now Kuujjuaq, Quebec. It was a time of immense change. Though Inuit had encountered qallunaat centuries before, colonization came late. “The modern world arrived slowly in some places in the world, and quickly in others. But in the Arctic, it appeared in a single generation,” writes Sheila Watt-Cloutier, an Inuk activist and author also from Kuujjuaq, in <em>The Right to Be Cold</em>. “In a sense, Inuit of my generation have lived in both the ice age and the space age.”</p>
<p>In 1939, the Supreme Court ruled that Inuit were to be classified as “Indians” under the Constitution and should therefore come under Canadian jurisdiction. During World War II, the United States Air Force built bases on Inuit land in Kuujjuaq (Fort-Chimo), Iqaluit (Frobisher Bay), and Paallavvik (Padloping Island). These were used as pit stops for planes en route to Europe. It was also during World War II that the Canadian government created the disc number identification system. Simon’s number was E9-761: “E” meant she was from the east of Gjoa Haven, “9” meant she was from northern Quebec, and “761” was her personal number. The discs and numbers were discontinued in the 1970s, after Inuit adopted last names through a government program called Project Surname.</p>
<p>The Crown came north too. Simon recalls her grandmother owned a picture of the queen and talked about the monarch with her friends. “I remember how much she was revered,” said the governor general. Despite Angnatuk’s fondness for the queen, subjugation of the Arctic to Crown law was one of the most harrowing eras in Inuit history. “In the period leading up to the 1960s and 1970s, the relationship between the Europeans and Inuit was a grossly one-sided one,” wrote Simon in an article for <em>International Journal</em>. “We Inuit suffered a steady loss of control over our ability to make decisions&mdash;decisions for ourselves and for the lands and waters that have sustained us for thousands of years. We became a colonized people.”</p>
<p>In an interview with <em>Up Here</em> magazine, Simon <a href="https://www.uphere.ca/articles/if-youre-northerner-youre-always-northerner" rel="noopener" target="_blank">remembered</a> walking to school with her friends&mdash;skipping, laughing, fighting with the boys, and chatting in Inuktitut. But when they approached campus, one of them would say, “Stop talking!” And they’d fall silent&mdash;no Inuktitut, no English. Inuit have a word for the feeling the children had: ilira&mdash;a “mix of apprehension and fear that causes a suppression of opinion and voice,” explains Hugh Brody in <em>The Other Side of Eden</em>. “When southerners told Inuit to do things that were against Inuit tradition, or related to the things that qallunaat wanted from the North, Inuit felt that they had to say yes. They felt too much ilira to say no.”</p>
<p>After grade six, Inuit children from Kuujjuaq were taken away to a residential school in Churchill, Manitoba. But not Simon&mdash;her father was white. Nancy and Bob’s children, the only Inuit kids left in their village, were homeschooled. Simon remembered when crying adults, after church on Sundays, would hug her and her brothers and sisters hard because their own babies were gone. “They missed their children so much that they almost treated us like we were their children,” Simon told <em>Up Here</em>. “The winters were long and lonely.”</p>
<p>Children weren’t the only ones taken from their homes. In the 1950s, Canada <a href="https://www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/ottawa-inuit-agree-on-compensation-for-forced-relocation-in-1950s/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">relocated</a> Inuit to settlements. Two of the most infamous relocations took place in 1953 and 1955, when Canada removed Inuit from Inukjuak in northern Quebec and Pond Inlet on Baffin Island to two High Arctic settlements: one at Grise Fiord on Ellesmere Island and another near the military base at Resolute Bay on Cornwallis Island. The official reason for this forced migration was humanitarian. Inuit in Inukjuak, according to the government, were overpopulated and dependent on welfare. But according to Inuit, relocated families were coerced into leaving. In the High Arctic, they served as “human flagpoles” buffering Canadian sovereignty during the Cold War. There, they suffered. Communities splintered, with wedges driven between families and generations. They struggled to adjust to the long, dark winters and short summers. Their deep knowledge of the Inukjuak ecosystem didn’t translate to the scant flora and fauna of Grise Fiord and Resolute Bay. Some contracted tuberculosis. Others nearly starved. </p>
<p>By the 1960s, most Inuit were living in settlements. But removal and resettlement did not put an end to what the Canadian government had come to call the “Eskimo Problem.” Inuit relied on sled dogs for hunting and transportation. A good sled dog could find its way home in a storm. Dogs were known to dig out igloos buried in winter and pull fallen hunters out of broken sea ice. “The husky dogs allow us to be at peace with ourselves, providing us with the ability to provide food for our families, and knowing that they will alert us if there is any danger,” said a hunter in the documentary <em>Echo of the Last Howl</em>. “Those dogs are the best lifeguards.” </p>
<p>In the 1950s and ’60s, according to Watt-Cloutier’s <em>The Right to Be Cold</em>, Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers and government officials travelled the region hunting for Inuit dog teams. The Mounties claimed that many were infected with canine distemper and had turned violent. The dogs were confiscated and sent south for so-called health care. They were never seen again. More often, hunters were told to bring their dogs to a specific area, where the animals were immediately shot by police. “In some instances,” writes Watt-Cloutier, “the carcasses were thrown in piles and burned. All this happened in view of their shocked owners.” This slaughter deprived Inuit of the mobility that was the basis of their livelihood. Inuit culture transformed rapidly as a cash economy replaced the traditional one. Without their children, dogs, and way of life, many turned to alcohol.</p>
<p>To survive, Inuit had to learn to live in Inuit and qallunaat worlds&mdash;ice age and space age&mdash;simultaneously. Simon, a child of both, was exceptionally good at cultural time and space travel. “She was truly raised in two worlds,” her husband, Whit Fraser, told me. He recalls sitting around the table with Mary and her parents, Bob and Nancy. “The languages would shift depending on who was the centre of the conversation or who was speaking,” he said. “Inuktitut between Bob and Nancy. Inuktitut between Nancy and her mother. English between her and her father. English with me. English with me and her mother and father. And that worked. I don’t understand Inuktitut, and I certainly don’t speak it. But I never felt left out of the conversation.”</p>
<p>Sometimes it seems as though Inuit are being punished for holding on to their language. After Simon was announced governor general, French Canadians complained she couldn’t speak French. The day school Simon attended in Kuujjuaq didn’t teach it. Though the governor general is bilingual in English and Inuktitut, one of the first, original, and oldest languages of this land, that wasn’t good enough for some French Canadians. Hundreds penned formal complaints about Simon’s appointment to the commissioner of official languages, who opened an investigation. A <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-governor-general-mary-simon-faces-legal-challenge-over-appointment/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lawsuit</a> has even been filed.</p>
<p>As the governor general has no policy-making privileges, her influence over reconciliation relies on her ability to connect heads of state and government with Indigenous peoples&mdash;to navigate conversations about and across painful histories that are still being unearthed. Simon has lived those realities and navigated those difficult conversations her entire life. “The path to reconciliation is really about talking to one another,” Simon told me, in an interview, of her decision to take the governor general’s job. “Having the conversations. Telling each other our own stories. And also to talk about what’s been happening in Canada in regards to Indigenous peoples. Because many, many Canadians don’t know.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smallcaps">ary Simon sat</span> in the dark boardroom of a Montreal skyscraper with that feeling of ilira creeping up in her chest. These were the offices of the James Bay Energy Corporation, a subsidiary of Hydro-Québec that was building one of the largest hydro-electric dams in the world&mdash;on Inuit and Cree land in northern Quebec. The James Bay Project, as it was called, was announced by Quebec premier Robert Bourassa in 1971. It would divert or dam several rivers and construct eight generating stations in northern Quebec. One generating station, named after Bourassa, would create a man-made waterfall taller than Niagara Falls. Designed to fulfill a campaign promise, the James Bay Project would produce thousands of jobs and enough power for Quebec to begin exporting energy to the United States. But as a consequence, an area about the size of Jamaica would be submerged. Inuit and Cree who lived on that land were not consulted before construction began. In 1973, a Superior Court judge granted these Inuit and Cree an injunction, but the James Bay Energy Corporation appealed. So as they sat across the table from provincial negotiators, construction on the James Bay Project continued. “We were a rag-tag, poorly funded group of Inuit and Cree up against governments and very powerful industrial interests,” Simon later recalled.</p>
<p>Just a few years earlier, in 1969, the same year prime minister Pierre Trudeau published a white paper proposing to abolish the Indian Act to permanently assimilate Indigenous peoples, Simon took a job with the CBC Northern Service. She produced radio and TV programs in Inuktitut, wrote for <em>Inuit Today</em> magazine, and learned about the James Bay Project. These were the early days of the Inuit movement and the heyday of the American Indian Movement when diasporic Inuit from different regions came together for the first time. Like other Indigenous peoples, Inuit often gathered in cities far from their homelands. They would discuss political strategies to protect and reclaim their rights, culture, and land, over traditional foods. Frozen, but more often dried, caribou, fish, and seal from the north would be laid out on cardboard in the middle of the room. Attendees would cut a hunk, usually with one shared semicircular knife called an ulu. </p>
<p>At meetings of this budding brotherhood, Simon stood out. “Mary was part of that group of Inuit who were forging the path towards Inuit being recognized as their own distinctive group of Aboriginal peoples in Canada,” recalled Nancy Karetak-Lindell, a former member of Parliament representing Nunavut. “She was one of the very few women in leadership at that time, which didn’t go unnoticed by young women who were watching all of this.” </p>
<p>Simon played a role negotiating the James Bay Northern Quebec Agreement signed in 1975. She later described these negotiations as her “first real experience” working on Indigenous rights. The agreement recognized that Inuit and Cree should at least have some say in economic development on lands they had never legally relinquished. It affirmed their rights to hunt, trap, fish, and self-govern in the James Bay region. But it also extinguished their legal title to the territory. In exchange, Quebec agreed to pay $225 million to support Inuit and Cree education, social services, and economic development over twenty years. Three Indigenous-owned corporations were created to manage the settlement money. Thus, the Northern Quebec Inuit Association became a corporation called Makivik, which means “to rise up.” Watt-Cloutier writes about a member of the negotiating team who later compared the agreement to an old tale about six hunters who can’t find any game and have to eat the leftovers of a picky snowy owl. “Our trying to get legal concepts and legal rights recognized by the government is often like the snowy owl&mdash;we often have to eat what he won’t eat, and we have to make do with that. But, hopefully, that will give us enough energy to go on with the hunt.”</p>
<p>In the Inuit hunt for rights, Simon’s responsibilities were growing. Elected secretary of the Northern Quebec Inuit Association in 1976, she presided over the implementation of the James Bay Northern Quebec Agreement as vice president of Makivik from 1979 to 1982 and then as president from 1982 to 1985. Those were the same years that she advocated for the recognition of Indigenous rights in the Constitution as a member of the Inuit Committee on National Issues. She later played a prominent role in the negotiation of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords, which pushed further constitutional reforms. During the Charlottetown Accord negotiations, Simon was one of a trio of Indigenous women dubbed the “Mothers of Confederation,” in part because the accord codified the Indigenous right to self-government. A referendum on the Charlottetown Accord in 1992 was defeated by a coalition that included former prime minister Pierre Trudeau as well as voters in Quebec and the western provinces. In the Northwest Territories, home to many Inuit, a majority of voters approved the referendum. Canada has not attempted constitutional reform since. But in 1993, Inuit won the <a href="https://nunatsiaq.com/stories/article/yesterdays-news-historic-land-claim-agreement-signed-in-igloolik/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">largest land claim</a> in Canadian history and created their own self-governing territory anyway: <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/nunavut/">Nunavut</a>.</p>
<p>In a span of less than thirty years, Inuit wrestled power away from qallunaat and transformed how their lands&mdash;fully one-third of the country&mdash;are governed. Simon’s rise coincided with that history, but her political genius came into its own when she led not just Inuit but all Indigenous peoples to new heights.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smallcaps">ary Simon walked</span> into the meeting in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, and began looking for the placard indicating her seat. According to Fraser’s memoir, <em>True North Rising</em>, space had been set in that sterile way hotel conference rooms are done up: clothed tables arranged in a rectangle so that diplomats and negotiators can converse as equals&mdash;eye to eye, nation to nation, sovereign to sovereign. The year was 1990. Simon was president of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, an international body representing about 160,000 Inuit in Canada, Greenland, Alaska, and Chukotka (Russia). In 1977, the council was formed as “a means of ensuring protection of Inuit culture and the Arctic’s resources,” writes Simon in her book <em>Inuit: One Future&mdash;One Arctic</em>. In 1986, Simon was tapped to lead the organization.</p>
<p>The purpose of the 1990 meeting was to negotiate the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy, an agreement among nations with territory in the Arctic Circle to monitor and protect the Arctic environment as well as its flora and fauna from global warming, pollutants, and waste. If you were to look at the globe from the north, you would see that Inuit Nunangat, Greenland, Chukotka, and Alaska form a sort of half crescent around the Arctic Ocean&mdash;or, as some oceanographers call it, the “Arctic Mediterranean.” In this northern sea world, an archipelago of ninety-four major islands and more than 35,000 minor ones, Inuit are the dominant population in all but Chukotka. And yet, at the table of nations making decisions about the future of the Arctic, no Inuit had a seat.</p>
<p>The United States’ lead negotiator, ambassador R. Rucker Scully, made it clear that the Americans wanted only “sovereign” nations at the table. He told Simon that she was not a participant in the Yellowknife meeting, merely a presenter. Because she was not a diplomat from one of the five member nations of the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy Group, she would have no seat. </p>
<p>For Simon and the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, this would not do. She marched out of the meeting and into the lobby and gave waiting reporters a story: “Arctic Inuit Not Welcome at Arctic Conference.” Canadian bureaucrats, who did not want to appear prejudiced, scrambled to get Simon away from the journalists’ cameras, notebooks, and recorders. With the leverage created by the bad press, a new set of negotiations began, with the member nations attempting to placate Simon and the Inuit Circumpolar Conference. Simon and Inuit had, by then, already reformed Canadian sovereignty to accommodate Indigenous peoples. Now they were aiming to do the same to the international order.</p>
<p>In 1994, prime minister Jean Chrétien appointed Simon as Canada’s first ambassador for circumpolar affairs. In that role, she was tasked with helping bring together an eight-country group now known as the Arctic Council. In Ottawa, in 1996, Simon negotiated seats on the Arctic Council for Indigenous peoples as “permanent participants.” The designation gives Indigenous peoples less leverage than a member state but more than a non-Arctic observer state (such as China, Germany, or the United Kingdom), creating an entirely new framework for Indigenous influence over international policy making and politics.</p>
<p>As permanent participants, Indigenous organizations have submitted proposals and consulted with voting member states to ensure Indigenous rights and Indigenous knowledge are included and respected in international agreements across a wide range of issues, from conservation to shipping corridors and free trade agreements. “Permanent participants were able to sit at the table with the senior Arctic officials and the ministers and to have the dialogue that is absolutely necessary for consensus building,” Simon later said. “We couldn’t go much further than that. So we agreed to this status.” The six Indigenous organizations on the Arctic Council remain the only Indigenous peoples with a say in any international body. This might sound like little more than a clerical change, but it’s not. In the Arctic, which comprises 4 percent of the Earth’s surface, Indigenous peoples have a seat at the table of nations.</p>
<p>In <em>True North Rising</em>, Fraser recalls attending a formal dinner in Washington, DC, as chair of the Canadian Polar Commission. He was seated next to an American diplomat who worked for Scully, and the two men were getting along just fine. Then, out of the blue, the American said, “Tell me, Whit, there is this very difficult Inuit woman, Mary Simon. Do you know her?”</p>
<p>The woman sitting on the other side of Fraser nearly choked on her food. Her name was Marianne Stenbaek. A McGill University professor, Stenbaek was one of Mary Simon’s best friends.</p>
<p>“I do know her,” replied Fraser, not missing a beat. “Very well, in fact, and you are right, she can be very headstrong.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smallcaps">y people</span>, the Secwepemc and St’át’imc nations from what is now British Columbia, are quite Catholic. We baptize our children, eat the body and drink the blood of Christ, and sing hymns in our Salish tongue. Though we don’t often speak of Coyote, the trickster from whom we are descended, we still cause trouble, like he did, from time to time. In the 1990s, for example, activists from our nations put their bodies in the paths of trucks hauling the last old-growth trees out of our forests. The St’át’imc, my grandfather’s people, composed a song back in those days. It goes: “Hey-ya-ho, hey-ya hey-yo. Canada is all Indian land!” That’s the song protesters sang to shame Justin Trudeau when he arrived at the Kamloops Indian Residential School in <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2022/05/24/news/trudeau-receives-mixed-reaction-kamloops-memorial" rel="noopener" target="_blank">May 2022</a> to mark the end of a year of mourning for the dead children hidden in the former school’s apple orchard. </p>
<p>And maybe Trudeau deserved it. Though many of us are Catholic Indians, the Secwepemc still practise our traditional funerary and mourning rites. These last a year, during which we do not hunt, fish, or harvest our traditional foods. We put away all photographs of the dead. Long ago, we would not even speak the dead’s name. After that year, we return to the grave. We give away the deceased’s belongings. And, often, we feast and play a traditional gambling game, lahal. Though he had been invited to Kamloops for the first ever National Day of Truth and Reconciliation, Trudeau observed the holiday commemorating the genocide of our children by taking his family on vacation. So when it was the prime minister’s turn to speak to survivors and descendants in Kamloops, he was heckled. The task of delivering a meaningful eulogy on behalf of Canada fell to Mary Simon. </p>
<p>Though she has served for less than two years, Simon has represented the Crown during one of the most tumultuous eras in its history. There was a pandemic and then a backlash against the public health measures instituted to contain it, culminating in an attempted takeover of Ottawa by a convoy of truckers. There was a federal election, a visit from the pope who apologized to residential school survivors, and the death of the queen. There were, in other words, many turning points where the nation might have lost the plot. But that day, Simon wasn’t speaking from a Canadian perspective. She was speaking from an Indigenous one. “Today, we make ourselves heard across the country,” said the governor general. “Although it is hard, we are telling Canadians and the world about our wounds and pain.”</p>
<p>The governor general, like her people, has persisted against immense unfairness and indignity. Though Inuit have beaten qallunaat at their own game at the local, territorial, provincial, national, and international levels, Inuit have not escaped the death trap of colonization. Today the Arctic is warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the world. While the United Nations considers global warming of two degrees to be potentially catastrophic, average temperatures in the past century have already risen by two or more degrees in some parts of the Arctic. Warmer temperatures thin the ice, making it dangerous to hunt. They soften the snow, making it difficult to build igloos. They make the game smaller and scarcer. And they change animal behaviours and migration routes, rendering knowledge built over generations of observation useless. Though Inuit have produced almost none of the emissions now heating the planet, the cold environment that makes them who they are is melting&mdash;a portent for the rest of us. </p>
<p>And yet I wouldn’t bet against the first peoples of the far north. They long outlasted the first colonists they met. Their children were taken. Their dogs were shot. They were relocated. Their lands were flooded. And they were told repeatedly they had no place nor claim in the courts, negotiating rooms, or parliaments where decisions about their lives were made for them. And yet, time and again, they figured out how to make themselves heard. And then Mary Simon got them to the head of the table. Monarchs die. Empires fall. The Vikings are long gone. The Soviet, French, and British empires too. And here Inuit are, still gathering over the bounty of their lands and waters, telling stories of heroic leaders like Simon as they plot out the next ways they’re going to outfox qallunaat. That’s how it’s been the past fifty years. That’s likely how it will be for the next fifty. And who is to say that tradition&mdash;the tradition of the qulliq, not the Crown&mdash;won’t carry on long into the future?</p>
<p>Simon might be the representative of an office rooted in Canadian and British imperialism. But she rose to that office through an Inuit political tradition that successfully combatted imperialism and transformed Canadian sovereignty and the international order in a remarkably short time frame&mdash;in no small part, because of her. Most people have no clue that Indigenous peoples even have political traditions. To my knowledge, few, if any, political science departments in the world bother to study this history and look at these questions that way. But those interested in winning power for the Indigenous and colonized world would be wise to know the story of Simon and her people. </p>
<p>“There is a word in Inuktitut, my mother tongue: Ajuinnata,” said Her Excellency the Right Honourable Mary Simon as she brought her eulogy in Kamloops to a close. “It means to never give up, to keep going, no matter how difficult the cause may be. You never gave up. You continued to tell your stories&mdash;continued to tell these children’s stories. Together you confront this painful past. Together, you will make sure these children are brought home. And together we will continue building a better future for Indigenous peoples.” </p>
