You&#8217;ll find the rest of our selections <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/category/issues/november-2023/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p><em>When Lawrence Hill published this essay eighteen years ago, could he have known how long it would keep its contemporary aura? Today, we often hear justifiable critiques of those limited ways Africa surfaces in the global imagination. But it’s critical that the diasporic desire for more positive points of identification not turn into ambivalence toward unphotogenic crises. Among other forms of paralysis, Hill’s essay criticizes indifference among African American political leaders amid the Rwandan genocide of 1994. As of this writing, the war in Sudan has left Khartoum’s morgues at their breaking point; a coup in Niger has further destabilized an already-beleaguered Sahel region; and terrorist groups are spilling into coastal West Africa. Progress </em>has<em> been made in Zimbabwe, which has significantly reduced the number of new HIV infections. But the Black North American indifference toward atrocities in Africa&mdash;conflicts directly related to the aftermath of colonialism&mdash;cannot afford to continue. Hill lays bare the reasons.—Connor Garel, Justice Fund writer in residence, November 2023 issue</em></p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n the 1970s,</span> as a teenager, I took a solo trip from my home in Toronto to visit family in Washington, DC, and foolishly asked my grandmother, May Edwards Hill, what she thought of the Black operatic characters Porgy and Bess. May, born in 1896 and raised in a prosperous family that fitted proudly into the ranks of what was then called “the talented tenth”&mdash;America’s elite, university-educated Blacks&mdash;tore a strip off me for even mentioning the characters popularized in the 1935 folk opera by George Gershwin, a white composer. The disabled Porgy, who wheeled himself about on a cart, and Bess, an unfaithful lover, were lowbrow Southern Blacks who, despite poverty and suffering, loved each other and lived with gusto and passion. Even as fictional characters, they nauseated my grandmother.</p>
<p>“We have enough stereotypes to combat as it is,” May muttered, “and they just bring shame down on all Negroes with their cavorting around and their immorality.” Her complaint reflected one of the most troubling paradoxes about Black identity in North America. For 400 years, we’ve been seen to be less than human. And so, to compensate, we must be more civilized than the civilized. We place unreasonable expectations on ourselves, such is our desire to succeed in the world and to be accepted as equal to those who dragged us across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>I should have known better than to put that question to May. I was familiar with the way Black communities sometimes slap down writers&mdash;especially strong Black feminists&mdash;whose characters “discredit the race.” Zora Neale Hurston’s 1937 novel, <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em>, a wild celebration of a free-spirited Black woman who takes up with another man without bothering to divorce her husband, was lambasted by Richard Wright, the major US Black novelist of the time, for offering “no theme, no message, no thought.” Alice Walker infuriated some with her depiction of a Black male character as a brutal, incestuous rapist in her bestselling novel <em>The Color Purple</em>. Black artists are to be morally upright standard-bearers for the young men and women who need to be shepherded toward responsible adulthood, and their fictional creations had better stay in line too.</p>
<p>By the age of ten, I was well versed in Black history and entranced by accounts of how my white mother, a civil rights activist, and Black father, a graduate student, had formed a union against all odds, married in the American South in 1953, and decamped that very week to spend the rest of their active lives fighting for human rights in Canada. Dad’s own father and grandfather had combined their work as ministers in the African Methodist Episcopal church, disseminating the social gospel in the Black communities they served. Stories had filtered down the generations about my great-great-grandfather purchasing freedom for his wife, his children, and himself in Maryland in 1860. “How did he get the money?” We speculated about it at the kitchen table. “Probably stole it,” came one response, with a cackle. But when the laughter subsided, we were quietly warned: “If you don’t fight racism, you become part of the problem.”</p>
<p>Stories abounded in my family about W.&thinsp;E.&thinsp;B. Du Bois, whose essay collection <em>The Souls of Black Folk</em> stands out as one of the seminal works of African American literature of the twentieth century. Born in 1868, Du Bois became the first Black to obtain a PhD from Harvard University and lived to the age of ninety-five. In 1900, he coined a phrase that spread like wildfıre and became a mantra among observers of race relations in America: “The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line.” And in September 1903, he published “The Talented Tenth,” one of his most famous essays, in which he argued that only the elite of the African American population could pull the rest of the Black population up by its bootstraps, and that education would save the Black people of America.</p>
<p>“Was there ever a nation on God’s fair earth civilized from the bottom upward?” he wrote. “Never; it is, ever was and ever will be from the top downward that culture filters. The Talented Tenth rises and pulls all that are worth the saving up to their vantage ground.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="smallcaps">or people like me,</span> being Black and having access to a good education carried certain obligations. It wasn’t good enough to get “A”s in school&mdash;you also had to ball up your fists and charge into battle if anybody used the word “nigger.” In the workplace, it wasn’t good enough to merely succeed professionally. You had to change the world too.</p>
<p>So what happened to this forward-looking, educated, socially engaged Black middle class? They were a powerful force for social change, leaders and supporters of civil rights movements, eloquent speakers and writers for the plight of North American Blacks&mdash;and for Africa itself. Africa needs them now, but are they interested in Africa?</p>
<p>This question arose in my mind last year when news broke about genocide in Sudan. It had also troubled me a decade earlier, when we learned about genocide in Rwanda. In her 2002 Pulitzer Prize–winning book, “<em>A Problem from Hell”: America and the Age of Genocide</em>, Samantha Power notes that no African American political leaders staged demonstrations or held hunger strikes while 800,000 people were killed over a hundred days in the Rwandan genocide. “No significant Rwandan diaspora lived in the United States; few African-Americans identify specific ancestral homelands and lobby on their behalf the way Armenians, Jews, or Albanians might,” Power wrote. Ironically, while North American Blacks were applauding the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa in 1994, Rwandans were being butchered in the worst genocide since the Holocaust. We, along with the rest of the world, stood by and let it happen.</p>
<p>Global indifference to the Rwandan massacre and to ongoing African atrocities has been much studied. But let’s not forget Blacks in the diaspora, by which I mean peoples around the world who are of African heritage and who feel connected to each other and share a sense of kinship with the continent. From us, one might expect dedicated action. Instead, from the vast majority, there has been a haunting silence not unlike that of people who stand implicated, yet immobile, at the cemetery gate.</p>
<p>I am about to embrace, with some reluctance, the very paradox that deserves incineration&mdash;that obligation to out-civilize the civilized. In so doing, I place an unfair moral burden on the shoulders of African Americans and African Canadians. But what else is there to do? To whom else can we turn?</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smallcaps">ver the centuries,</span> there have been many examples of Blacks on this continent reconnecting with Africa. In 1792, some 1,200 Black United Empire Loyalists became so disgusted with their ill treatment in Nova Scotia that they sailed from Halifax to create a colony in Sierra Leone. In 1824, emancipated American slaves sailed to Africa and founded Liberia. Shortly after creating the Universal Negro Improvement Association in 1914, Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican, was leading a massive Black organization with hundreds of chapters in the US, Canada, and across the world. Garvey urged Blacks in the Americas to embrace a “back to Africa” movement and argued in favour of founding a Black nation in Africa. The son of a stonemason, Garvey left school at the age of fourteen, and his populist movement celebrated Black pride. He couldn’t have differed more from Du Bois, but both men exuded passion about Africa.</p>
<p>Du Bois, who helped found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and spent forty years organizing Pan-African Congresses, led the way in bridging Africa and America. “The mystic spell of Africa is and ever was over all America. It has guided her hardest work, inspired her finest literature, and sung her sweetest songs,” he wrote in his 1962 biography of the American abolitionist John Brown. For Du Bois, social progress for Blacks in America went hand in hand with the liberation and development of African countries. After earlier trips to Africa, he finally moved to Ghana in 1961, at the age of ninety-three. He died there on August 27, 1963, the day before the famous civil rights march on Washington, DC.</p>
<p>Blacks in America hit the peak of their civil rights activism in the 1960s, at the very time that African nations were winning their independence from British, French, and other European colonial powers. It was no accident of history. For many, independence in Africa rode the same wavelength as the civil rights movement in the US. “The similarities in the political and psychological urgings of Black America and pre-independence Africa were real and profound,” Howard Jeter, a former US ambassador to Nigeria, has noted. “Africans and Black Americans, knowing that they were equal to any other human being, sought to be treated as human beings.”</p>
<p>In 1974, when Muhammad Ali took his heavyweight boxing championship fight with George Foreman to Zaire, he electrified Blacks around the world. Two years later, the African American author Alex Haley published <em>Roots: The Saga of an American Family</em>, a multigenerational novel reaching back to the birth in 1750 of an African named Kunta Kinte and to his kidnapping and subsequent enslavement in America. The book was translated into twenty-six languages, sold millions of copies, and was made into a major television miniseries, and African Americans responded enthusiastically to the fictionalized genealogy. <em>Roots</em> met with such commercial success because it offered a personal link between a Black American family and their African ancestors&mdash;a connection now so theoretical and tenuous that it has become almost mythical for most Blacks.</p>
<p>These days, the members of the diaspora resemble the detached and cooling embers of a dying fire. A few artists and academics celebrate Africa, but for the most part, the rest of us look away. Africans survived the Atlantic slave trade, the carving up and colonization of their continent, and the transition to political independence, but they now face cataclysmic threats to which we, in North America, remain indifferent.</p>
<p>Collectively, Blacks failed to exert the political pressure necessary to force the global powers to intervene and prevent the devastating civil wars in the West African countries of Sierra Leone and Liberia. We also looked away from the murderous civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We have remained largely mute about the current genocide in Sudan.</p>
<p>Blacks and others in North America did rally in defence of the Black majority of South Africa under apartheid rule. Somehow, it was easier to generate widespread opposition to the South African regime because the targets of our ire were the minority white rulers of the country. In that clear-cut moral issue, we pinpointed the enemy efficiently. But why hasn’t the greatest ongoing crisis Africa has ever faced&mdash;the HIV/AIDS pandemic&mdash;drawn the same support? And why no action against the murderers in Rwanda, the DRC, or Sudan? Do these examples of Black-on-Black violence cut too close to the bone?</p>
<p>Few North American Blacks now relate to the homeland. Presented with a map of Africa, most cannot even point out Lagos, Ouagadougou, Khartoum, or Cape Town. Geographic ignorance is like the tip of an iceberg, hinting at a much deeper void in our collective psyche about Africa and its peoples. For some of us, it hurts too much to think about Africa. The irony of this becomes almost unbearable when you travel in Africa and meet schoolchildren who recite all sorts of information about Canada and America. Once, while travelling in Cameroon, I met a young man who waxed enthusiastic about the various Canadian cities he had heard about: “How I long to visit the wonderful metropolitan centres of Calgary, Toronto, Montreal, Quebec, and Joliette,” he said, clapping his hands together. Joliette?</p>
<p>This embrace of a far-off continent and all its promises is not reciprocated by North American Blacks. Indeed, we identify less and less with Africa, and our battles here at home take our attention away from a threatened people whom we don’t even know. Africa is too distant, too big, too confusing, <em>too much</em>. Second only to Asia in size, Africa has fifty-three countries, nearly 1 billion people, over 1,000 languages, and a diversity of cultures and religions. How to connect with that when there is no firm point of connection, save the knowledge that one or more of your ancestors was stolen from some unknown village in an unknown and unfamiliar land?</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he world’s worst</span> humanitarian crisis is unfolding before our eyes, and its crucible lies in Africa. The United Nations estimates that 25 million Africans are living with HIV/AIDS; 1.9 million of them are under the age of fifteen&mdash;90 percent of the infected children in the world. The outlook for them is grim. In 2003, 2.2 million people died of AIDS-related illness in sub-Saharan Africa, representing over three-quarters of the worldwide total and 16 percent more than the year before. North American Blacks are reacting to this catastrophe like tense drivers in rush hour, refusing to make eye contact with the desperate person five metres away who wants to slip into their lane. <em>I’m not letting you in. I’m not even going to recognize your existence</em>.</p>
<p>Stephen Lewis, the UN special envoy on HIV/AIDS in Africa, has often sounded the alarm bell. “The pandemic is overshadowing anything we know in human history,” he told members of the Canadian parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and international trade. “People now talk about a hundred million deaths down the road. I don’t doubt that for a moment.”</p>
<p>I asked Lewis to comment on African American leadership in addressing the AIDS pandemic in Africa. He tiptoed, noting that through their churches and their wallets, many African Americans have funnelled assistance to Africa in its time of crisis. And he acknowledged that groups such as the Congressional Black Caucus&mdash;an advocacy group comprising African Americans in both parties in the US House of Representatives&mdash;have consistently lobbied for greater government funding to address AIDS internationally. Nonetheless, he noted, “In terms of the pandemic, it is somewhat curious that the African-American leadership in the United States has been so slow to rally.”</p>
<p>Curious, indeed. Some might call it shameful. Where are the marches? The demonstrations? Where is the unstoppable will that desegregated America, demanded that US troops withdraw from Vietnam, and defied the apartheid regime of South Africa?</p>
<p>AIDS, even more than genocide and famine, involves a devastating destruction of humanity and features an elusive enemy—a virus emboldened by poverty. It’s the ultimate litmus test for a diaspora, and Blacks are failing. Badly. I wanted to know why, so I started an inquiry within my family, interviewing Black American relatives who had been reared on the same values of social obligation that my parents espoused. My cousin, Marie Metoyer, a retired psychiatrist living in Manchester, New Hampshire, seemed like a good pick because she and her mother, Lena Edwards Madison, spent their best years providing medical services in their own communities. “You were to achieve, excel, integrate into the white community, and that, with education, was to be your salvation,” she said. And Africa? “Ideally,” Metoyer said, “there is an onus on African-Americans to take an active role for humanitarian reasons in Africa. Unfortunately, some of us are so involved in our own spheres and interests that we don’t see Africa as a priority.”</p>
<p>Another relative&mdash;Adele Flateau, fifty-three, who has spent twenty-five years in community service and now works at a clinic for HIV/AIDS patients in Brooklyn&mdash;had a similar message when I asked her what had happened to the activism of the sixties.</p>
<p>“I think we didn’t pass on the torch to our next generation, and those of us that were in the forefront back twenty or thirty years have kind of fizzled out. We have a lot more Black elected officials now, but they just don’t seem to be very outspoken. In fact, they’ve been very silent. There is an eerie kind of silence among most of the Black leadership now.”</p>
<p>Outside the clinic where Adele works, a taxi driver&mdash;a thin, middle-aged Black man who gave his name as Jacob&mdash;wanted to know all about the article I was writing. He showed a lively knowledge of Africa and was quick to offer an opinion: “Sure, you will meet some Black community leaders who care about the AIDS crisis in Africa. But most of us? Forget it. It’s like, I’ve got my rent to pay and The Man is leaning on me left, right, and centre, and I’m trying to get my kids through school without being shot at, so don’t talk to me about Africa. I’m American. Talk to me about America, and about the damn leak in my roof.”</p>
<p>His attitude is familiar to Charles Barron. Barron, a former member of the Black Panthers, emerged as one of America’s most radical Black politicians after the people of Brooklyn elected him to the New York City Council in 2001. Barron argues that diminished identification with Africa prevents Blacks from stepping up to the plate.</p>
<p>“If you do something to a Jewish person in Israel, Jewish people who were never born in Israel, born in America, will scream. If you do something to a Chinese person in China, the Chinese in Chinatown will holler. Or if something happens to Korea, the Korean people in America will holler,” he says. “But we don’t have that kind of identification with Africa.”</p>
<p>Salih Booker, executive director of Africa Action, a pro-Africa lobby group based in Washington, DC, notes that young African Americans show an interest in the continent but know very little about it. “All Americans are by and large ignorant of Africa, and that’s true whether you’re African American or white American,” Booker told me. “Most Americans and most African Americans just don’t have opportunities to study or travel or learn much about Africa, and therefore they’re inundated mainly with negative imagery—Africa starving, Africa at war, genocide, those sorts of things&mdash;which creates a mental barrier. Often some folks don’t want to identify with Africa because these are the only images they have.”</p>
<p>When I asked Bill Fletcher, Jr., president of TransAfrica Forum&mdash;another Washington-based activist organization interested in American policies affecting Africa and other countries in the diaspora&mdash;how effectively African Americans were pressuring their government to respond more meaningfully to African crises, he was blunt.</p>
<p>“I think that people dropped the ball, but I think part of it, frankly, within Black America is what could only be called embarrassment,” he said. “When we look at Africans, we also look at Africa as a continent of Black people, so why are they fighting each other, why are they killing each other?” Fletcher tied Africa’s current troubles to historical factors such as the way in which the continent was arbitrarily carved up into countries to suit the interests of European colonial powers. Knowledge of the legacy of French colonialism would lead to a fuller understanding of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Fletcher said, “but many people just look at it and say, ‘My God, I don’t even want to think about it.’”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t must be</span> acknowledged that some African Americans are still fighting for Africa. For example, the Congressional Black Caucus, particularly Democratic congresswoman Barbara Lee from California, and Africa Action, the advocacy group led by Booker, have consistently lobbied the Bush administration to increase funding for AIDS intervention in Africa. Booker, who assembled a coalition of thirty Black American religious leaders to advance Africa Action’s lobbying efforts, told me: “One out of eight Americans is directly of African descent. This is a country of African descent as much as it is a country of European and other descent.”</p>
<p>“Then there is the modern self-interest,” Booker said. “The world is a very small place, and we have a vested interest in things like defeating the global AIDS pandemic because it is a threat to international security, stability, and economic progress, and it happens to be concentrated in Africa right now.”</p>
<p>Strong advocates like Booker also support a full cancellation of debts owed by African countries to the International Monetary Fund and to the World Bank, in part so that African nations can attain the financial breathing room necessary to address the AIDS pandemic themselves. They accuse the Bush administration of blocking access in Africa to cheaper, generic drugs for anti-retroviral treatment for AIDS patients and demand that the road be cleared.</p>
<p>On top of lobbying efforts, there are small groups and individuals carrying out heroic work in Africa. Of all the people I interviewed, I was most moved by the courage and conviction of two African American women who have dedicated their lives to the fight against AIDS in Africa. Neither is famous. Neither is a national figure in the US.</p>
<p>Pernessa Seele is the indefatigable leader of the Balm in Gilead, a Black American not-for-profit, non-governmental organization that aims to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS throughout the African diaspora. The Balm in Gilead works with some 15,000 churches to provide education and support to people affected by the disease in the US and Africa. With eighteen employees, the organization devotes about half of its $3 million annual budget to addressing the AIDS pandemic in five African countries&mdash;Ivory Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Seele, who grew up in a segregated town in South Carolina, says that although some African American organizations have pressured the American government to direct more resources toward the fight, there is a huge void on the political front. “Presently, I think we’re failing terribly. I don’t think that the African American community is really mobilizing and pushing for anything politically at this time. We are politically dead. Where is the fire of the sixties? The fire of the sixties is out. Folks have moved on.”</p>
<p>For a time, Seele suggests, Black Americans lost themselves in materialistic obsessions, remained in denial about AIDS, and simply couldn’t feel the “intense infusion of pain” that AIDS victims and their families know all too well.</p>
<p>More recently, Seele notes, Black churches have been addressing the crisis. “Clearly, after [twenty-four] years with this epidemic raging, nobody is coming to save us but us.” In fact, she says, the AIDS pandemic now offers a way for Black Americans to reconnect to Africa.</p>
<p>One of Seele’s sisters-in-arms in the war on AIDS is Melva Black, a social worker born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee. Black had never travelled to Africa until her church, the Metropolitan Interdenominational Church, decided to carry its extensive AIDS service programs across the ocean. In 2000, Black’s pastor, Reverend Edwin C. Sanders II, attended the UN AIDS conference in Durban, South Africa. There, he met a woman who ran an underfunded orphanage in which seventy children, who had HIV/AIDS or were orphans of AIDS victims, lived in a building with two bedrooms and one bathroom. The orphanage was facing increasing financial difficulties and had to come up with $20,000 (US) to buy the land on which it was situated. Reverend Sanders promised to ask his approximately 700-member congregation to look into resolving that difficulty. Less than a year later, the Nashville church had raised the $20,000. They then sent a delegation&mdash;including Melva Black&mdash;back to the community of Waterfall, on the outskirts of Durban, with the money to purchase the land for the Agape Child Care Center.</p>
<p>For Black, much has happened since then. In the past few years, she has travelled numerous times to Africa. She doesn’t travel alone. She brings Americans from various churches on twice-yearly trips and helps connect them to other orphanages and schools in need of assistance.</p>
<p>Seele and Black are angels on earth. But their work&mdash;and the efforts of Africa Action and other lobby groups&mdash;is like drops of water in a tidal wave of North American indifference and, within the Black community, they are exceptions that prove the rule.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="smallcaps">o far,</span> no one has proven capable of exciting public sentiment or pushing governments to substantial action. Africa barely registered in last year’s elections in Canada and the US. Societies are collapsing while we in North America watch (or don’t watch) with hands folded, sitting quietly like church mice.</p>
<p>With racism and inequality cluttering our own backyards, it isn’t fair to ask Blacks to tackle the problems of Africa. But the AIDS pandemic isn’t fair either. So, as my grandmother might have argued, we have to demand heroism from Blacks anyway.</p>
<p>We insist that our children enjoy the benefits of the civil rights advances made by our parents and grandparents. Yet our vision is too continental. We dare not glance across the ocean, preferring not to think about the daily fate of children, women, and men in Africa. Our ancestors stumbled off the boats and survived against all odds, and we’re sure as hell not looking back now.</p>
<p>Even with various trips to Africa and friendships with Africans, I have not taken up the challenge of responding fully in Africa’s time of greatest need. My own children know less of Africa than I did of the civil rights movement when I was their age. This cannot continue. When I was ten years old, I asked my father at what point I would become responsible for solving problems in the world. He looked at me tenderly and said, “As soon as you become aware of the problems, they become yours too.” We are aware of the problem, and we must do something, or no one will follow us.</p>
<p>Stephen Lewis argues that Canadians could choose one African nation ravaged by AIDS and devote massive resources, expertise, and medications to help turn the tide of the disease there, to show the world what can be done. He’s right. To date, however, we have done next to nothing. Like others on this continent, African Americans and African Canadians have chosen to ignore Africa.</p>
<p>We must fill the deep void in our collective psyche regarding Africa. This wound, this emptiness, prevents us from being whole. May Edwards Hill shrank decades ago from the stereotype of the promiscuous Porgy and Bess, but today we must stop cringing at the sight of African famines, civil wars, genocide, and corruption. Historical wrongs, accidents, misfortunes, and misdeeds present only one aspect of Africa. Remember the undeniable humanity of nearly 1 billion individuals on the continent, each with a beating heart, aspirations, and an inherent right to live with dignity. And remember that African peoples have permeated, influenced, and enriched virtually every aspect of North American society. Part of our response to Africa must emanate from a renewed sense of pride in ourselves, connection to Africa and its peoples, and a rebirth within the diaspora.</p>
<p>It would be absurd to claim that a reinvigorated response to Africa must come solely from outside the continent or just from Blacks in the diaspora. But movements have to start somewhere, and Africa needs a credible, powerful, influential group to assume the sort of leadership that could galvanize millions of North Americans. Blacks in Canada and the US are more than capable. They could supply the leg that kicks North America into action.</p>
<p>In 1917, the US Central Committee of Negro College Men issued an urgent wartime call to arms. “The race is on trial,” they wrote. “It needs every one of its red-blooded, sober minded men.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;Up, brother, our race is calling.” I never dreamed I’d be invoking this same mantra more than eighty years after the end of the Great War. I never thought I’d be asking myself&mdash;or appealing to others&mdash;to ball up their fists and fight. The Great War was said to be the war to end all wars, but it didn’t turn out that way. The civil rights movement was supposed to guarantee dignity and freedom for all, but we never truly took the movement across the ocean to include the people of Africa. It appears that the greatest war to fight, as we wade, leaderless, into the opening chapter of the twenty-first century, will be settled by medicine, not bombs, by community service, not the maniacal pursuit of self-interest.

They’re here to celebrate my forty years in journalism. There’s the gang from <em>Domino</em> fashion magazine, where I got my start in the can’t-spend-enough, cocaine-stoked ’80s. The <em>Globe and Mail</em> crew, from the ambitious middle of my career, hang out with colleagues from <em>Maclean’s</em>, the <em>Toronto Star</em>, and <em>Metro</em>. (I moved around a lot.) The CBC News crowd are huddled to my left, protecting themselves and their fat budgets from the circling sharks of underfunded journalism. My final job was with them: we were together for the <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> shutdown, the murder of George Floyd, the storming of the Capitol in Washington, DC, the invasion of Ukraine, nuclear threats from Russia, and blazing forests and atmospheric rivers at home. It was the most punishing news cycle of my career. I wasn’t sad to be leaving.</p>
<p>Just beyond the guests and beyond the hornbeam trees where I’ve strung fairy lights for the party, I think I can see my future. The grind of work is finally over, my retirement dream cued up. April in Paris! Reading by the sea! Spanish lessons in Antigua so I can better speak to my grandson. I’ll be playing with him, too, in the open-ended days my children rarely knew with me. I’m not saying I deserve a life of ease. But I worked hard to earn my retirement, dropping giant chunks of my salary into company and government pension plans throughout those forty years. It’s time for the famous social contract to hold up its end of the bargain and take care of me, the way it did my father before me, to deliver on the idea that retirement is my right after a life of work and the promise that I will have the time and means to enjoy it. </p>

<p>Except none of that happened. The year since my retirement party has not been a dreamy passage to a welcoming future but a nerve-shattering trip into the unknown. My debt is swelling like a broken ankle; my hard-won savings may or may not be sucked into the vortex of an international market collapse. Can I keep my house? Who knows? The macroeconomy is messing with my microeconomy. The future keeps shape-shifting. And none of the careful planning I put into my retirement is going to change that. </p>
<p>When I left my last job, I felt sad for friends determined to keep working to seventy and beyond. How eccentric they seemed. Now I repeat the same two words whenever I see them: “Don’t retire.”</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="dropcap">R</span><span class="smallcaps">oughly a thousand people</span> are retiring each day in Canada, Fraser Stark, president of the Longevity Pension Fund at Purpose Investments in Toronto, told me. That’s about a million currently retired. Ours is the largest generation in Canadian history to move into retirement, and we tend to get distracted by the sheer number of us snailing through the system like a row of snowplows on a four-lane highway. But the bigger issue with retiring at sixty-four, which is the average age Canadians leave the workforce, can be summed up in one increasingly terrifying word: longevity. </p>
<p>Anyone retiring in Canada right now can expect to live at least until eighty (women until eighty-four). But those numbers are averaged out. When I began to discuss retirement with my financial planner in early 2022, he put my life expectancy at ninety-four. “Why, thank you,” I said, “I do try to keep fit.” “No,” said Benjamin Klein, senior portfolio manager at Baskin Wealth Management, “life expectancy is not randomized. When we factor in your gender, genetics, access to good health care, education, and lifestyle, that’s how long you’ll live.”</p>
<p>Stark doubled down on that number. The oldest Canadian is believed to have died at age 117. “If you want to accurately plan, that’s the number that you need to write down,” he said. Retire at sixty-four and you could have fifty more years to save for. </p>
<p>Every generation lives longer than the one that came before&mdash;nothing new there. But a fifty-year span between the end of work and the end of life is a long way from the original purpose of paid retirement, which was a very short bridge of financial support. Or no bridge at all. Otto von Bismarck has been trotted out and smacked down many times for his invention of paid retirement: in 1881, he proposed that all Germans had the right to government support after a life of work, with payments kicking in at age seventy. Except that life expectancy in the 1880s was about forty years. When Canada created its own pension plan, in 1965, to address the growing poverty of retired Canadians sixty-five and older&mdash;thank you, Lester B. Pearson, for my monthly CPP cheque&mdash;the life expectancy of men, who made up the bulk of the workforce, was sixty-eight.</p>
<p>By 2019, 37 percent of Canadians fifty-five and older were concerned they wouldn’t have enough savings when they retired, <a href="http://- Canada.ca https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/programs/research/canadian-financial-capability-survey-2019.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to</a> the Canadian Financial Capability Survey. And that was before the rush of retirements during COVID, a third of them earlier than planned. Lockdown’s low interest rates and curtailed spending gave false hope to retirees such as me&mdash;those unspending days when the money in my bank account seemed to self-spawn like guppies. And, also like guppies, its lifespan was short lived. </p>
<p>“There’s not enough gold in my golden years,” I told Klein a few months into my retirement. I could feel him smiling sympathetically across the phone line. “You’re not alone,” he assured me. Rents, mortgages, groceries&mdash;Canadians are suffering. I described the little house graphic on my gas bill: the house keeps getting smaller, thanks to my ferocious vigilance. But the bill keeps getting bigger, thanks to the cost of gas. And that’s just standard housekeeping. Throw in the unexpected, like a family wedding or grown kids moving back home, and many retired people land “somewhere on the spectrum of panic,” Klein said.</p>
<p class="pull-quote">The oldest Canadian is believed to have died at age 117. Retire at sixty-four and you could have fifty more years to save for.</p>
<p>According to BMO’s thirteenth <a href="https://newsroom.bmo.com/2023-02-07-BMO-Annual-Retirement-Study-Canadians-Believe-They-Need-1-7M-to-Retire-Up-20-Per-Cent-from-2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Annual Retirement Study</a> released this past February, Canadians believe they need $1.7 million to retire, up 20 percent from 2020, when they put it at $1.4 million. The number is not statistically supported, but it’s a good gauge of people’s emotional preparedness for retirement and how anxious they feel. That third of Canadians who were worried, in 2019, that they wouldn’t have enough money has jumped to more than half of us in 2023, and 74 percent are concerned about inflation and rising prices. </p>
<p>Fewer than a quarter of retiring Canadians have a defined benefit pension plan, Stark said. Instead, “many of us retire with a lump sum of money.” The amounts vary, but the massive uncertainty of how long the money will last doesn’t. “We don’t know how long we’re going to live; we don’t know what the interest rates will be; we don’t know what the stock markets will do; we don’t know what inflation rates are,” said Stark. “Every one of us when we retire is on a unique journey of insecurity.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t&#8217;s not only</span> the retired who need to worry about supporting themselves in the long stretch of their future. Working generations coming up behind them will also shoulder this burden. A metric called the dependency ratio calculates the proportion of the people not in the workforce who are “dependent” on those of working age. According to Statistics Canada, dependents are aged zero to nineteen and sixty-five and over. Productives are twenty to sixty-four. The international tool is often cited by government and business and has been a driver of pension-reform debates around the world.</p>
<p>A low dependency ratio&mdash;in Mexico, for example&mdash;means that there are enough people working to support the dependent population. A high ratio&mdash;Japan and South Korea are at the top&mdash;indicates more financial stress on workers. Across all OECD countries right now, there are about thirty people sixty-five and over for every 100 people of working age. In 1950, that ratio was fourteen to 100; by 2075, it is predicted to increase to fifty-five non-working adults for every 100 working. </p>
<p>In Canada, we’re at the lower end, with dependency expected to hit about thirty-five by 2025, according to <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/pensions-at-a-glance-2015/old-age-dependency-ratio_pension_glance-2015-23-en;jsessionid=u7Q5drCgbYElgirFEUbcU5kQQhgkBcz_MWWQ4vhE.ip-10-240-5-146" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2015 data</a> from the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. But by 2075, our dependency ratio is projected to be 49.9&mdash;one dependent for every two working-age Canadians. That’s a big burden for Xs, Ms, and Zs. “The shrinking percentage of young people means that in the future, the number of workers may be insufficient to finance the pensions of retirees,” according to StatCan. </p>
<p>The original meaning of the word “retire,” from the French “retirer,” is the act of retreating, falling back, withdrawing into seclusion. Except the retirees I spoke to for this story had go-go schedules that I was worn out just hearing about. Many had taken on dramatically different types of paid employment after leaving their careers; others had unleashed their inner rebels to become tireless advocates for social justice and climate change; still others were full-time caregivers. </p>
<p>“The government pays very little” for retired Canadians, said Thomas Klassen, professor at York University’s School of Public Policy and Administration. Of the experts I spoke to about retirement, he was the only one of traditional retirement age, so you could say he had a stake in the debate, but I found him reliably dispassionate. He pointed out that retirees in new jobs pay income tax, taxes on their retirement income and government subsidies, HST and GST, and they contribute to the economy by spending money. “And yet we keep hearing that boomers are hoarding all the money and that we will bankrupt younger people,” he said.</p>
<p>Samir Sinha called the dependency ratio outdated and misguided. The director of geriatrics at Sinai Health and University Health Network in Toronto and a passionate defender of the rights of older Canadians argued that such concepts hold us back. “They don’t recognize the new reality that at sixty-five you’re likely to have twenty years” of good and productive life ahead. </p>
<p>The retired are among the country’s biggest contributors to child care and volunteer work, Sinha said. “Think about the amount governments save for the unpaid care that mostly older people are providing. When we’ve priced out the unpaid caregiver, we’re valuing that in the billions and billions of dollars every year.”</p>
<p>Mieko Ise might be called a “silent retiree”: someone who quietly leaves the workforce to look after family members in need. For years, she juggled looking after her own and her husband’s parents while working full time for a Toronto nonprofit. “I started to have issues with being a caregiver and a full-time employee,” said Ise, now in her sixties. “I would take vacation days. I would book time off. My boss was not particularly sympathetic. I get it. I don’t believe employers should carry the load of your life burden.” When it became too overwhelming to have two jobs, Ise quit the one we count as work. </p>

" width="1200" height="1320" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-159890" /></p>
<p>Sinha pointed me to a Japanese movie called <em>Plan 75</em>, directed by Chie Hayakawa and released in 2022. In a dystopian future, Japan&mdash;which in real life is the demographically oldest OECD country, with a projected dependency ratio of seventy-seven to 100 by 2075&mdash;offers $1,000 to the elderly to terminate their own lives and relieve society of the burden of supporting them. The movie, which I watched with my seventy-six-year-old sister (a lawyer who retired at seventy-two), opened with a violent murder off camera. We heard the blast of gunshot and saw a wheelchair toppled on its side. “Cheery beginning,” said Laura. (It turned out&mdash;spoiler&mdash;the real <em>Plan 75</em> was to sell the older generations’ ashes for profit to a recycling company. The message of the sweetly weird movie was it’s better not to kill our elders.)</p>
<p>The year before <em>Plan 75</em> came out, Yusuke Narita, an assistant professor of economics at Yale University, suggested mass suicide and disembowelment for Japan’s aged. “I feel like the only solution is pretty clear,” he said in a 2021 video. Narita later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/12/world/asia/japan-elderly-mass-suicide.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">softened his comment</a>s in response to questions from the <em>New York Times</em>, saying they were an “abstract metaphor” (disembowelment seems pretty visceral to me). But he did win a big audience: he now has more than 600,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<p>It’s true that the number of people over sixty-five is growing faster in countries across Asia than anywhere else in the world at the same time that the size of their younger generations shrinks. That means as many as half of Japan’s employers report shortages of full-time workers, according to <em>New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/07/world/asia/japan-workers-retirement.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reporting</a> from earlier this year on ageing in Asia. Workers in their seventies and even eighties are stepping up to fill the gap, taking lower-paying jobs as delivery drivers, office cleaners, and store clerks&mdash;jobs that the younger generations don’t want. A quarter of people sixty-five and over in Japan are currently working. </p>
<p>The number is the same in Canada and increasing: 24 percent of Canadians aged sixty-five to seventy still work in jobs that can be measured, up from 11 percent in 2000. But the dependency ratio reinforces the belief that those sixty-five and over are not working. Workers are not counted as workers because they’ve <em>aged out</em> of the way that we count them. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">“T</span><span class="smallcaps">he Greys”</span> is what the older generation working for <em>Succession</em>’s Waystar RoyCo were called. They were often shot bunched together like an endangered species. They put on compression socks before flying. They plotted for their golden parachutes. Or maybe “one last rodeo,” as Karl, Waystar’s CFO, suggested to Frank, former vice chairman, in the final minutes of the hit series. Cut to Tom, the brand new CEO: “Frank, dead. Karl, dead. I really don’t need those two old cunts on my shoulder.” </p>
<p>I thought it was funny as hell. Or I did before my conversation with Lisa Taylor, president of Challenge Factory and co-author of <em>The Talent Revolution: Longevity and the Future of Work</em>. Taylor described ageism as “the last socially acceptable form of prejudice.” She and her company have set 2030&mdash;the year the last of the boomers reach sixty-five&mdash;as the target for solving what she described as the far-reaching and urgent issue of this country’s age-biased workforce.</p>
<p>I was skeptical. Surely, there are more important workplace issues to solve, like equity and fairness for people of every race and gender. But after a couple of hours on the phone with Taylor, I came to believe that treating retirement as a default outcome of ageing is a workplace bias that will affect the life expectancy, financial dependency, and long-term care costs for a generation retiring earlier than it needs or wants to. Not to mention the impact on the economy. Taylor said if we want to take advantage of our full workforce&mdash;in 2022, Canada had <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410032501" rel="noopener" target="_blank">nearly a million job vacancies</a>&mdash;we need to get to a point where we “recognize and call out ageism with the same level of comfort as we do other prejudices in our workplaces.”</p>
<p class="pull-quote">Fewer than a quarter of retiring Canadians have a defined benefit pension plan. Instead, many of us retire with a lump sum of money.</p>
<p>Systemic ageism was meant to have been legislated out of the workplace in 2006, when the Ontario Human Rights Commission won the argument that Canadian workers don’t come with a best-before date stamped on their foreheads. (I was a manager at the <em>Globe and Mail</em> at the time, I was fifty-one, and there was a lot of backroom worry about carrying the Greys on our backs&mdash;and a lot of wisecracks about a superannuated newsroom.) But even though sixty-five hasn’t been the legal age for retirement for seventeen years, “we’re constantly looking for ways to push them out the door,” said Sinha&mdash;with retirement packages, buyouts, and pension contributions capped at sixty-five. </p>
<p>Taylor’s company did a workplace survey of the financial services industry in 2015, and it showed that as early as age forty-nine, workers were no longer sent for training or high-performance programs and future-focused career conversations had slowed down. By the time someone hit fifty-five, “the conversation about leaving had been going on for years, except no one was actually saying it.” </p>
<p>My own conversations with retired Canadians, particularly men in finance, bore this out. Raymond Betts worked most of his life in the frenetic world of institutional equity in New York, Boston, and Toronto. (Betts asked that his name be changed for this article.) When he turned fifty-three, the company hired a younger employee to do the same job as his, without discussing it with him. “My desk was originally thirty-six inches long; they kept moving me to a smaller desk until I ended up sitting at one that was twenty-four inches long.” Betts left that world at sixty, taking his skills and work ethic to his second career as a real estate agent. </p>
<p>Many people buy into the company storyline that their best years are behind them&mdash;the proverbial coasting into retirement. “People start to say, ‘Susan’s checked out. Susan retired a few years ago, she just hasn’t told us,’” said Taylor. “It’s attributed to age instead of the company’s mismanagement of talent.”</p>
<p>It’s not a big step from there to the accepted myths about older workers: they’re slower and less productive. They’re over the hill, so training them is a cost instead of an investment. Ditto spending any time performance-managing them. The stickiest myth is that the long-time employee is too expensive. “Get this senior person off the books and hire two younger people to replace them,” is how Sinha put it. I’ve been part of those conversations myself about retirement-age people; likely my bosses also had them about me. But seeing the older worker as a financial burden is a failure of math. </p>
<p>“Calculations of how much employees cost a company generally include salary and benefits packages,” said Taylor. However, their not having to learn on the job, be trained, or engage the resources of a mentor, let alone the asset of being used as a mentor for younger staff&mdash;all of this also saves costs. “I have the experience, the relationships, the contacts. I work incredibly hard,” said Betts. He still does: he’s sold 132 houses in the seven years since he turned sixty.</p>
<p>I mentioned to Taylor that some of the Greys at CBC News seemed to struggle with technology during COVID. She stopped me. “We give a pass to the twenty-three-year-old with cats walking back and forth on camera,” she said. But we snicker when someone over sixty leaves their mike off. I blamed imminent senility, especially when the person on mute was myself. </p>
<p class="pull-quote">Another problem with retirement: it could kill you. People who stop working too soon may not have much time to live before they die.</p>
<p>Taylor was unsurprised. “Ageism is also self-imposed,” she said. Her example was the joke birthday cards we send each other. “If you replaced age with any other characteristic, you would never send it,” she said. I don’t mention the card I just received for my sixty-eighth birthday, a New Yorker cartoon called “Senior Charades.” The old man’s word bubble says: “Two words&mdash;I forgot what they are.” It got a big laugh and led to various tips about how to behave at work to appear less old: Don’t groan when you stand up. Smile in meetings so your face doesn’t sag into resting-old-face. And never rummage for anything, especially glasses. (Actually, never say the word “rummage.”) </p>
<p>Taylor, who turned forty-nine this spring (and says she’s been losing her glasses since she was twenty-two), is a long way from retirement; so are most of the experts I spoke with. I found their dedication moving; they saw it as realistic. “Unlike other prejudices, 100 percent of people will feel age prejudice if we don’t solve it,” said Taylor. Klassen thinks it will take twenty years for the workplace to reflect the law. Sinha said we’re still in the “baby steps” of realizing that longevity has implications for how long we work. “The workplace has not caught up with the reality of life expectancy, and therefore of career expectancy,” he said. </p>
<p>Working longer because you’re likely to live longer is not everyone’s idea of how best to reform retirement. It’s an anathema in France, to give the most widely reported example. President Emmanuel Macron finally pushed through his pension reforms this past spring, increasing the retirement age from sixty-two to sixty-four over a seven-year period. In the often-violent street battles that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/france-protests-police-violence-5a2e01ed4fbcfeee6a3ac098db94339c" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fed headlines</a> everywhere, protesters lost a thumb, an eye, and even, to one officer’s club in Paris, a testicle. One of the many slogans from the protests stood out for me: “Leave us time to live before we die.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smallcaps">ut here&#8217;s</span> a more existential problem with retirement: it could kill you. People who stop working too soon may <em>not</em> have much time to live before they die. “You hear about the doctors whose entire life and identity was at the hospital,” said Sinha. Then they retire and “they’re dead a few months later.” Similar sudden-death stories circulate about a certain type of driven, lifelong journalist, and I always assumed they were apocryphal. Or that the victim had been ignoring long-standing health issues. </p>
<p>Shortened life expectancy can be predicted by a lack of purpose, Sinha said. He referred to a “meta-analysis” project from 2010 that combined research from 148 studies involving 308,849 people to show that social connection and purpose increased survival by 50 percent. A lack of social relationships created the same risk of death as well-established factors such as smoking, drinking, and obesity. It was a gobsmacking discovery thirteen years ago; a lot of subsequent research has since supported the finding that early retirement can mean less time to enjoy it.<br />
The Blue Zones research into the world’s longest-lived people, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/5-blue-zones-where-the-worlds-healthiest-people-live" rel="noopener" target="_blank">much publicized</a> by National Geographic and now a Netflix docuseries called <em>Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zone</em>, also links longevity with purpose. “In the island community of Okinawa”&mdash;in Japan, where very long-lived women thrive on a diet of sweet potatoes, mugwort, and goya&mdash;“everybody can tell you what their sense of purpose is,” said Sinha. “They have a word for it: ikigai, which means ‘reason for being.’”</p>
<p>Every society uses markers as shorthand for people to understand each other. “In some societies, it’s your last name or who your parents were,” said Taylor. “Americans use job titles, but they’re equally likely to identify each other by the city they grew up in, or what university they went to, or what sports team they’re a fan of.” In Canada, she said, “we almost exclusively use our job titles to define who we are.” Sometimes we go so far as to use our previous job to describe ourselves after we retire, in what Taylor calls a “backwards-looking identity.” Even when we’re not working, “we reinforce work as a critical piece of our own identity.” </p>
<p>John Davey worked at Dow Chemical in his hometown of Sarnia, Ontario, for thirty-two years. He left at age fifty-eight. “I didn’t retire. I <em>was retired</em>,” Davey, who’s now seventy-two, told me. It was part of a company-wide downscaling (he bears no grudges). It took less than a month for him to understand he was not the stay-at-home type. “One day, I sat in my living room and hoped it would snow so I could go out and shovel.” He’s worked ever since, most recently as a flower-delivery-person. “I know men who say they are going to regrout the bathroom or whatever, but that’s done and then what?” he said.</p>
<p>Don O’Connor put the perils of not having purpose more starkly. He was in wealth management and real estate at TD Bank, in Toronto, for thirty-six years, so his financial literacy was better than the average Canadian’s. COVID made him realize how much he hated the three-hour commute, and so he retired last year, at sixty-two. Now he works part time at a funeral home in Burlington and loves everything about it&mdash;two-minute drive, flexible hours, every day is different&mdash;and puts up with the mild astonishment of his friends about his new job, because, as he told me on our call, “if you don’t do anything, you’re on an express route to death.” </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smallcaps">ere&#8217;s a bleak</span> prospect for many retiring Canadians: they will leave or be pushed out of the workforce too soon and without enough money. They’re financially prepared for the short and medium haul of life after work, but not the long one. They will go on to live too long, in too poor health (increased life expectancy has also increased the number of years people spend being sick), with a dwindling ability to support themselves or live independently. Ultimately, they’ll become wards of the state, housed in long-term care at great cost to the government and society. Sinha said: “This is where our destitute end up, in these government-run facilities.” According to a 2019 report by the National Institute on Ageing at Toronto Metropolitan University, long-term care costs <a href="https://www.niageing.ca/commentary-posts/10/7/long-term-care-costs-in-canada-projected-to-triple-in-only-30-years" rel="noopener" target="_blank">are expected to</a> triple from $22 billion to $71 billion by 2050. “It will be the equivalent of the modern-day Victorian poor house for our old,” Sinha said.</p>
<p>“We know this for a fact: the human brain is not equipped to make long-term decisions,” said Bonnie-Jeanne MacDonald, director of financial security research at the <a href="https://www.niageing.ca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Institute on Ageing</a>. “The human brain is very optimistic, which is great, but it can’t process the bad things that will happen in the future.” Decisions made now are not just for yourself in five years but for you in thirty years. “And that’s going to be a much more vulnerable person than you are right now, health wise.” </p>
<p>The National Institute on Ageing report says that, by 2050, care in one’s own home will cost up to $25,000 a month; care in a retirement home or residence could be as much as $10,000 a month. Those options will be unaffordable for most Canadians. Meanwhile, the number of people caring for family members at home will decrease sharply. Between now and 2050, Canada is expected to have 30 percent fewer voluntary caregivers, according to Sinha. Paid health care workers will not fill the gap: Canada’s universal health care system “was never designed to cover the provision of long-term care services,” including home and community care nursing, Sinha said. Long-term care insurance (LTCI) is now mandatory in Germany, South Korea, and Japan. Here in Canada, home-based care doesn’t even cover prescription medications. According to that 2019 Canadian Financial Capability Survey, a third of Canadians also worry they won’t be able to afford health care costs as they age, and rightly so. </p>
<p>“We spend the majority of our life savings paying for care in the last ten years of our life,” said Klein, the financial manager who put my life expectancy at ninety-four, which is sounding less and less like good news. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">f we could</span> create a different kind of retirement in Canada, a more inclusive, more creative, and flexible concept of work&mdash;and one that erased the grim picture of poor houses for the old&mdash;where would we start? After talking to dozens of experts and retired Canadians, three ideas, or ideals, formed my personal retirement manifesto. </p>
<p>The first would be to make measures against ageism part of every company’s fair-employment practice. Imagine a legacy career path that sees Canadians move from a forty- to a sixty-year work life, without censure or ridicule for being too old to work. I think of what Taylor said: “People change jobs all the time, but as we get older, we think we must continue doing exactly what we’re doing now or fall off a cliff. These are extreme alternatives.” The more high powered the job, and the higher in pay scale, the more we believe there is nowhere for workers to go but out. But many older workers prefer to forgo the intensity of management responsibilities, higher salaries, and relentless climbing and return to the craft work they excelled at in the beginning of their careers&mdash;even for a lot less money. Go ahead and ask them. As my own career wound down, I often thought&mdash;but did not say&mdash;that I wanted to go back to writing and editing, to revive my love of words that had taken me all the way to senior news director at the CBC, where I wasn’t allowed anywhere near copy.  </p>
<p>The second tenet of my manifesto is phased retirement. This one took me a while to get to, even though every expert and most of the retirees I spoke to were for it. I asked fellow CBC leader Greg Reaume, sixty-eight, who retired from running world news at CBC News a few months before I left myself, what he’d have said if I’d asked him to stay on a couple of days a week for the next two years, or if we’d opened that option to everybody. “A minefield,” Reaume said. “And complicated to manage.” “Right?” I agreed. Which is exactly the problem. Even if bosses like us believe in and desire phased retirement, taking on the labour-intensive job of juggling the options (do you make it mandatory to offer, but voluntary to accept?) and coordinating the schedules of part-time staff would keep managers from getting on side. We need to get them on side, though, because think of the benefits: to the worker who wants to keep contributing, to the employer who keeps getting returns on their experience and work ethic, and to the Canadian economy in need of workers. Figure that out and we move toward retirement becoming an adaptive and gradual transition rather than an on/off switch. Indeed, Klassen’s research showed a strong preference among older workers to gradually ease out of full-time employment, working fewer days over a period of several years. His definition of retirement is “a transition from working mostly full time to not working mostly full time.” </p>
<p>Finally, I propose we find new words to describe both retirement and retirees. A line from a 2014 <em>Atlantic</em> story on American retirement <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/09/the-great-stock-myth/308178/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">puts the lie</a> to the core idea of traditional retirement. “I don’t know if it’s ever going to be realistic that everyone saves enough to spend the last third of their life on vacation,” New York economist and author Allison Schrager was quoted as saying. (When I called her recently to ask if she still stood by this idea, her answer was a firm <em>yes</em>.) That vision of retirement, the one my father enjoyed and the one I had teed up for myself? None of it makes any sense anymore. Media, banks, and self-help books have lately been bandying around the term “The New Retirement,” but we should really be talking about the end of retirement. Instead of talking about “The Retired,” we should be talking about “The <em>Un</em>retired.” Not the undead&mdash;not yet&mdash;but maybe as indomitable. </p>
<p>Except that’s not right either. If our goal is to have Canadians work for as long as they’re excited and willing and able and empowered to do so, how about if we just call them workers? Because the essential zeitgeist of the retiree in 2023 is to keep working, however that looks. </p>
<p>Raymond Betts, even as he moves from being “goal oriented to soul oriented,” told me he will “never retire. My father worked until he was ninety-seven and died four months later, at ninety-eight.” Betts wasn’t sure he’d see the point in going on without work. “Work gives me a reason to call someone,” he said. “I have a mission. I have a reason to talk to people.”</p>
<p>Mieko Ise believes retirement is a time to take risks in a way that younger people who need to keep their jobs can’t. “Speak out!” she said. “I want to be reinvigorated, not retired.” Vicki Obedkoff, who retired in Saskatoon at seventy-one, after forty years as a minister with the United Church of Canada, fights for the same causes she’s always supported: climate change, human rights, and social justice. She quoted Alice Walker: activism is my rent for living on the planet. “I think about her often,” said Obedkoff. “I can’t see a time in the future when I will let this work go.”</p>
<p>Marjorie Beaucage, a seventy-six-year-old artist and Elder who lives in Duck Lake, Saskatchewan, was baffled by the whole idea of retirement. “I don’t know any of those retired people,” she said. “Elders don’t retire. Neither do artists. For Elders, this time of life is the busiest. You have to be there for your community.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he way I think</span> about my own retirement has changed significantly since I started working on this article. I’m part of a generation that will live the longest in history and also work the longest, if the big thinkers&mdash;and the workers themselves&mdash;succeed in moving Canadians from a forty-year career path to a sixty-year one. It’s new terrain, and the best way through is to be alert, adaptable, open to failure, and ready to act fast on success. </p>
<p>I don’t see retiring when I did as a failure&mdash;I had my second career as a writer I wanted to focus on and that grandson I’m gaga to spend time with. But I wonder why I didn’t have the conversation about a staged departure into a different kind of role, or why no one else had it with me. </p>
<p>I’m newly alert to dinner-table banter that turns ageist. It is without exception driven by people my age. “It’s time for the old farts to make way for the next generation,” said one retired financial industry executive at a recent dinner party when the conversation turned to the <em>Globe and Mail</em>’s leadership. (Phillip Crawley, publisher, announced <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-globe-and-mail-ceo-phillip-crawley-to-retire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his retirement</a> a month later, at seventy-eight.) “Hold on,” I said and then held forth on what I’ve learned about age prejudice. It may have been obnoxious. I will probably keep doing it. (Speak out, inner rebel!) </p>
<p>For now, I’m following Benjamin Klein’s simple financial advice: more input, less output. “Those are the only two things we can control,” he said. Which could mean getting a job&mdash;and not in management or journalism but something completely different. I’ve been an admirer of people who dedicate their retirement to volunteer work but felt pity when I saw someone my own age shelving groceries or working as a greeter. Now I think, “Long life headed your way, my friend!” I’ve stopped “backwards identifying” myself by the work I used to do, after Lisa Taylor asked me to “please be bold and to introduce yourself as you are now.” In my case, that’s as a writer. Now and then I even try to picture my future self, thirty years from now, but Bonnie-Jeanne MacDonald is right. It’s unfathomable. I accept that older Cathrin will be more fragile. Hopefully not in the poor house but perhaps a modest room or two, with a few things to remind me of the people I love&mdash;and also with the people I love. Likely I won’t be working. We can but hope. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-end-of-retirement/">The End of Retirement</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

A panorama of Manhattan appears, parcelled out on three screens above the stage: the southern view of the island in the mid-1970s, smaller and lonelier than today’s cityscape. The light over New York shifts from dusk to night to dawn to day as the pianist plays nineteen bars, slowing down to make way for a single crash of cymbals. A picture of a curled-up and forlorn-looking baby sheep fades in across the skyscrapers on the middle screen, and a raspy voice sings the first line of the first song of the nearly-two-hour saga ahead: “And the lamb / lies down / on Broadway.” </p>
<p>I feel the hair on my skin spring to a stand. I enter an alternate life: it is 1975, and I am at a Genesis concert. The band is performing its new double LP, <em>The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway</em>, which tells the story of Rael, a young part–Puerto Rican graffiti artist who is pulled into a shadowy world full of peril, where he is seduced by a siren and turned into a pustular beast. Peter Gabriel, the band’s lead singer, plays both Rael and his grotesque “Slipperman” alter ego, leaping from a riser and darting across the stage in jeans and a leather jacket or lurching around in a bile-coloured, boil-covered leotard and giant round head. Behind him, guitar players Mike Rutherford and Steve Hackett, keyboardist Tony Banks, and drummer Phil Collins play intricate passages of which each note is inextricable from the story.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s bizarre: it’s progressive rock. The genre emerged in the late 1960s, mostly in England, and Genesis was a founding member. So were King Crimson, Pink Floyd, Yes, and Rush. Labyrinthine songs with unexpected shifts in key and metre, stories that feature ghosts and monsters and angels and aliens&mdash;these are the staples of prog, as it’s fondly known. You have to be highly skilled&mdash;virtuosic, even&mdash;to play it; to appreciate it, you have to be more than a bit nerdy. “Supper’s Ready,” the nearly-twenty-four-minute seven-part “song” that claims the entire second side of Genesis’s 1972 record <em>Foxtrot</em>, is perhaps peak prog, with what fans have speculated are references to theology, tautology, and pop culture. Gabriel frequently changed costumes during “Supper’s Ready,” at one point wearing a red headpiece made of two three-dimensional triangles as an incarnation of the menacing forces Gog and Magog, versions of which appear in the Old and New Testaments and also the Quran. </p>

</ul>
<p>Gabriel walked away from Genesis in 1975, and Phil Collins took over as frontman. For a while, the band continued to play what I call Old Genesis songs&mdash;the material written and performed after Hackett and Collins joined, in 1970, and before Gabriel left. Collins sang them well but completely differently than Gabriel had. The costumes, the characters&mdash;all that was over, and seemingly forever. The band moved away from prog, at first perceptibly and then conclusively. By the mid-’80s, it was a pop band, keeping company on the charts with Madonna and Huey Lewis.</p>
<p>That’s when I fell in love with Old Genesis. I was in my mid-teens. It was a Sunday afternoon, and I was in the back seat of my parents’ station wagon, trying for the seventh or eighth time to read Rael’s impenetrable story inside <em>The Lamb</em>’s gatefold cover. Somewhere along the 401, I had an epiphany. I didn’t have to understand <em>The Lamb</em>. I could just accept it, absorb it, and enjoy it, in all its weirdness. Back at home, I played the record again, elated and despondent at once. Because I would never get to see my favourite band perform it live.</p>
<p>But then, miraculously, I did. In April 2022, wearing a face mask and a sweater that I had to take off repeatedly (hello, menopause), I saw an Old Genesis concert&mdash;word for word, note for note. Everything was as I’d imagined; everything was as it was&mdash;the lights, the sets, the costumes. Rutherford was even wearing the same white pants and shirt he always did. His long hair, as always, was hanging loose. But a trained eye would have caught this important difference: he was holding his guitar to the right, not the left.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="735" height="490" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HPbpl3Qmic4?si=W7ab8fWlDN4hZ192" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n her book</span> <em>Send in the Clones</em>, Georgina Gregory suggests that a number of systems converged in the mid-to-late 1970s to give rise to the first known tribute bands. One was the gaping grief that continued to simmer for years after the 1970 breakup of the Beatles; several of the earliest tribute bands paid homage to the Fab Four. Another was the birth of stadium rock, which meant fans would never again see groups like the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin in anything like an intimate setting. And then there was the growth of a nostalgia culture around rock and roll. In its dawning days, rock music was defined by its shunning of the past; twenty years later, the hippies of the ’60s wanted to relive their youth. </p>
<p>The nostalgia around Old Genesis has a unique intensity. That incarnation of the band only really existed for about five years, and many fans missed its heyday. For us, the nostalgia is for something we didn’t experience; it’s almost nostalgia for nostalgia. Serge Morissette was thirteen when he became a Genesis fan. This was in 1973, the year the band released its fifth studio album, <em>Selling England by the Pound</em>. Morissette grew up near Thetford Mines, Quebec, a city of about 26,000, south of the provincial capital. He wasn’t old enough to travel to Quebec City for a Genesis concert until 1977, so he never saw them play with Gabriel. He came to understand the full extent of what he’d missed after moving to Montreal for university in 1979. He was part of a fan club that included people who had been to Old Genesis shows. They shared photos and talked about concerts they had been to, particularly one at the Université de Montréal’s sports centre, known as CEPSUM, in November 1973, when Genesis was touring <em>Selling England</em>. It changed their lives, they said. “What Peter was doing, it was totally credible,” one of them told Morissette. “You believed in the guy.” This fan showed Morissette some Super 8 footage he’d taped of a concert from the same tour as the CEPSUM show. After he saw the film, Morissette wanted to see the show. In person. More than ever.</p>
<p>I said Genesis fans are uniquely nostalgic, but Morissette doesn’t strike me as someone who has spent much time in “if only” land. He’s more of a doer. By 1993, he’d graduated from mechanical engineering at UdeM and was working at the Société de transport de Montréal. He had a side gig at the Spectrum, a beloved (and bygone) venue on Sainte-Catherine Street in Montreal, where he helped out with visual effects and video editing. The owners happened to be fans of Old Genesis. When Morissette proposed a show commemorating the twentieth anniversary of Genesis’s CEPSUM concert, they agreed. </p>
<p>And that was how Morissette met Sébastien Lemothe, a young Montreal bass player who had recently formed a band called the Musical Box (TMB). Unlike the handful of Genesis tribute bands gigging in the city’s club circuit, TMB played Old Genesis music exclusively, with a focus on songs from the <em>Selling England</em> tour. They had a real Mellotron, an analogue precursor to the modern sampler that went out of production in the 1980s, and were as intent on reproducing the exact sound of <em>Selling England</em> as Morissette was on making the show look exactly as it did in 1973: the same lights, the same sets, the same costumes. TMB was “a perfect fit” for his purposes, Morissette says, the only small wrinkles being that it was a seven-piece band (there had been only five musicians on stage at the CEPSUM show) and that the lead singer did not play the flute, as Gabriel had done on the tour. Morissette decided he could live with the discrepancies and invited TMB to be a part of his project. </p>

<p>The show was set to run for three nights. Tickets were $20 a piece, a price that seemed exorbitant for what people understood was a cover band. On the first night, “the venue was empty,” Morissette tells me. (In fact, he remembers, they sold around 200 tickets; the venue’s capacity was about 1,200.) But when the keyboardist played the ominous opening chords of “Watcher of the Skies,” and a caped figure appeared on a darkened stage wearing a batwing fascinator and UV paint around his eyes, the Genesis fan who had filmed the Super 8 footage of the original production stood beside Morissette and cried, “That’s it! That’s it!” A TV crew filmed a live spot, and it ran on the ten o’clock news; the next two nights sold out. TMB took the show to Quebec City, and it sold out there too.</p>
<p>Lemothe wanted to keep going, to keep tweaking the show and bring it as close as possible to the original performances. (Lemothe was not available to be interviewed for this story.) He hired Morissette as a kind of consultant. Soon, TMB was looking for a new singer; the original frontman left the band in 1994. Enter Denis Gagné, who also grew up in Thetford Mines. (Two other current band members grew up there&mdash;drummer Marc Laflamme and François Gagnon, the band’s “Steve Hackett.”) Gagné and Morissette had met years earlier at a lip-synched Genesis tribute show Morissette put on at the local CÉGEP. (Morissette tells me Gagné still has the poster from that show). Gagné auditioned and became the band’s “Peter.”</p>
<p>Gagné had a bar shaved down the middle of his scalp just like the one Gabriel had in the early ’70s. He watched hours of video so as to copy Gabriel’s movements, down to the way he held and hit his tambourine. He memorized Gabriel’s spiels between songs; when performing for French-speaking audiences, he spoke French (his first language) haltingly, just as Gabriel had done. He and Morissette studied photos of the glittery rainbow cape Gabriel wore in “Watcher of the Skies” and spent days trying to determine what it was made of. Was it transparent? How did it react to black lights? When they discovered that the particular fabric was no longer being made, they sought out old swathes from textile warehouses, managing to find it in only five of the seventeen colours included in the original cape. They had to stitch in other “close enough” material. </p>
<p>Over the next five years, TMB expanded its repertoire, adding reproductions of Genesis’s tours of <em>Nursery Cryme</em>, which came out in 1971, and more frequently of <em>Foxtrot</em>. By 1998, the band had built a big following in Quebec and seen some success in Ontario but struggled to find an audience anywhere else. TMB had formed a corporation, which was losing money. The band couldn’t keep paying to play, and they couldn’t play in Montreal and Quebec City forever. They decided to see if they could do the one tour they hadn’t yet tackled: <em>The Lamb</em>. If not, they would call it a day.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he first tribute band</span> I ever saw was a group called Over the Garden Wall, a name taken from the Genesis song “I Know What I Like.” This was in the late ’80s, shortly after I’d moved to Montreal for university. The band played a mix of Old and post-Gabriel Genesis, and the singer wore parts of the costumes for some of the songs. I felt like I was at a party with sixty people who had also experienced a eureka moment in the back seat of their parents’ car. For the band, I felt a kind of awed gratitude. I could not quite fathom they were willing to play make-believe in front of a live audience. </p>
<p>I never sought them out again. I started following contemporary bands, and at some point, I became&mdash;like many people&mdash;dismissive of tributes. A prevailing notion took hold in the 1960s and ’70s that rock music should be original, authentic, written by the performer. Gregory points out that copyright laws have cemented this aesthetic, suggesting that “to perform anything other than one’s own material is symptomatic of creative bankruptcy.”</p>
<p>But the words “original” and “authentic” lie at the heart of TMB’s raison d’être. And to do <em>The Lamb</em> in proper TMB style, the band would have to recreate a slideshow that featured about 1,000 images, many of them staged: a gloved hand shaving a furry white heart with a straight razor, a man cradling a porcupine. The pictures accompanied the songs, but they were more than a complement&mdash;they were another layer of storytelling. There was no footage clear or comprehensive enough to discern each and every frame. TMB needed access to the original slides&mdash;but first, they needed permission to perform <em>The Lamb</em> at all. </p>
<p>Because it essentially qualifies as a musical (story plus music), anyone wanting to recreate <em>The Lamb</em> has to obtain a special licence called “grand rights.” Morissette reached out to Tony Smith, Genesis’s long-time manager, who said Morissette would have to ask Gabriel. He was eventually able to contact Annie Parsons, who worked at Gabriel’s record label, Real World. The answer was no, Parsons told Morissette: Gabriel wanted to adapt <em>The Lamb</em> himself. Morissette called her back. “Mrs. Parsons,” he said, “maybe my request isn’t clear. What we are asking for is permission to recreate <em>The Lamb</em>. Peter won’t recreate it; he will do something else with it. What we are asking for is not in competition in any way.” Morissette could hear the exasperation in Parsons’s voice, but she relented. “‘Send me some video, and I will ask him again,’” he remembers her saying. </p>
<p>About a month later, Morissette received a fax with Gabriel’s response: this time, the answer was yes. It took about two years in all to secure a one-year licence to perform the show. TMB paid to have the slides copied and delivered to Montreal. New costumes and sets were built over several months. Every single festering bubble on the Slipperman getup was reconstructed by hand, using clay and latex. TMB premiered its <em>Lamb</em> production on October 11, 2000, at the Spectrum and played several more shows in Quebec and Ontario over the next nine months. </p>
<p><em>The Lamb</em> was a turning point. TMB had always seen itself as having less in common with a tribute band than, say, an orchestra playing Beethoven; now, Beethoven was taking the orchestra seriously. In 2002, when TMB brought its <em>Selling England</em> show on a seven-stop tour of the UK, the band members met Rutherford and Hackett at a rehearsal space in Chiddingfold, the Surrey village where Genesis’s recording studio, the Farm, is located. Hackett performed an encore with the band at Royal Albert Hall. Morissette visited Banks in his home. Gabriel saw TMB perform in Bristol and told Morissette to have Gagné phone him the next day. Gagné demurred; he was trying to protect his voice for the next show. “Serge looked at me and said, ‘Peter Gabriel is asking you to call him&mdash;you’re saying you’re not going to call him?’” Gagné tells me, speaking English with a slight British accent. He did, of course, speak to his archetype in the end. </p>
<p>In 2003, TMB visited the Farm, where they listened to the original <em>Selling England</em> tapes. They were also able to see the guitars Rutherford used on Genesis’s <em>Selling England</em> and <em>The Lamb </em>tours&mdash;both of them double-neck Rickenbackers, with a twelve-string guitar on one neck&mdash;which TMB had recreated for the left-handed Lemothe. That same year, after a second tour in Europe, TMB broke even for the first time. Since then, they’ve averaged about fifty shows annually, rotating between different productions. By the time I saw them play <em>The Lamb</em> in 2022, they were touring it for the fourth time. After the show, I did the math. Genesis put on just over 100 performances of <em>The Lamb</em>; TMB had played maybe three times that. I wondered if they knew <em>The Lamb</em> better than Genesis ever did. And also if they loved it better.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">o see a TMB</span> show as a fan of Old Genesis is to enter into a contract with the band. The band members will pretend to be Genesis and you will pretend to believe them. And in the course of the two-hour concert, if all goes to plan, there will be at least a few fractions of a second when you aren’t pretending.</p>
<p>At first, I thought this was why TMB mattered&mdash;because of people like me and Jack Beermann, who grew up in Skokie, Illinois. At sixteen, Beermann actually turned down the chance to go to a <em>Lamb</em> show in Chicago in 1975. “Ah, man,” he said to the friend who offered him a ticket. “I’m tired. My parents probably won’t let me go out. Thanks anyway.” After seeing Genesis play a year later&mdash;sans Gabriel&mdash;he went out and bought all the old records. “‘Supper’s Ready’ was the most amazing thing I’d ever heard,” he tells me. He became a super fan, collecting bootlegs, joining fan clubs, and going to see Genesis at least once on each of their subsequent tours. He heard about TMB through a Majordomo email list, and in 1994, he travelled to Montreal from Boston to see the band play at the Spectrum. As soon as the show started, he sat up in his seat. “I wasn’t expecting them to have a real Mellotron,” he says. When TMB performed “Supper’s Ready,” Beermann became emotional. Missing out on Old Genesis was “the biggest regret in my life,” he tells me. Seeing TMB, “I felt like I could rest.”</p>
<p>This is the kind of story I expected to hear. Then I talked to Thomas Manchon, who was born in 1987 and went to see TMB’s <em>Selling England</em> show in Paris in the early 2000s. He didn’t know anything about the costumes or the theatrics. “It was totally new for me,” he says. “It was just like a teenager in the ’70s going to a Genesis show.” It takes me a moment to grasp what this means: in a sense, for Manchon, TMB is Old Genesis. He never had to mourn what he missed: he never missed anything. “The first time I heard ‘Supper’s Ready’ was during a Musical Box show,” he says.  </p>
<p>For the past several years, Manchon has been helping TMB find Old Genesis archival material. In 2021, he sent Morissette some footage from a 1974 <em>Selling England</em> concert in Santa Monica. In the middle of the song “Battle of Epping Forest,” Gabriel took off his hat and threw it on the floor behind Rutherford. Morissette called Gagné and Lemothe immediately; none of them had ever seen Gabriel do this before. “We were yelling like kids,” says Morissette. This hat throw will likely show up in TMB’s refreshed <em>Selling England</em> show, on a tour that begins in November. It will be fifty years since Genesis played at the CEPSUM.</p>
<p>Morissette likens what TMB does to archaeology. I keep wondering whether it can be called art. Ian Benhamou, who joined TMB as keyboardist in 2018, thinks the word “artistic” might apply better; after all, he says, TMB is not creating anything new. But when I ask the band’s drummer, Marc Laflamme, “Is it art?” he is categorical: “It definitely is.” With TMB’s commitment to detail and accuracy, he says, they have invented a new way of paying tribute to Genesis. It’s not that they’re necessarily better than other Genesis tribute bands. It’s that they are the most devoted. </p>
<p>I ask Morissette who or what all his painstaking replication work is for. Is it for Genesis fans? Is it for Genesis? Is it in the name of some larger cause: the preservation of art? “Oh, it’s for me,” he says. He tells me that he started recreating the shows because he never got to see the real ones. But then it dawned on him that when he’s watching live music, he lives in the present. “It means I’m happy,” he says. “I’m living in the moment that is happening. I’m not thinking about the future or the past.”</p>
<p>I ask if he ever has a moment, like I did in <em>The Lamb</em> show, when he feels as though he’s watching the original band. He says that he is especially satisfied when TMB plays “Apocalypse in 9/8”&mdash;the sixth section of “Supper’s Ready,” when Gagné comes out wearing the geometrical headgear, and behind him, a special projector throws flames onto the sets. “For me,” he says, “it’s Genesis.” Does he enter an alternate reality? Does he forget that both he and the band are pretending? I doubt it. But I like to think that, at some point, the fact that Rutherford is holding his double-neck guitar to the right rather than the left blurs into the background. Just for a few fractions of a second. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/second-genesis-when-a-tribute-band-transcends-the-original/">Second Genesis: When a Tribute Band Transcends the Original</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>When the wave of reckonings triggered by #MeToo hit the literary world, we became curious about how CanLit, an institution stocked with provocative personalities, would fare. Which major Canadian book would suddenly become difficult to defend post Weinstein? What sprung most readily to mind was Leonard Cohen’s </em>Beautiful Losers<em>, a novel with the distinction of being intersectionally problematic (it’s racist </em>and<em> sexist). The book is particularly canonical in classrooms because its publication is seen as signalling the arrival of postmodernism in Canada, but it is also increasingly disturbing to teach because of its politics. Myra Bloom signed up for the mission of re-evaluating the novel and Cohen’s mystique as a self-styled ladies’ man more generally. The essay, originally published in April 2018, was especially well timed given the hagiolatry that intensified after Cohen’s death, but Bloom’s nuanced insights into the limits of artistic veneration are just as fresh and valuable today. &mdash;Carmine Starnino, interim editor-in-chief, November 2023 issue</em></p>
<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smallcaps">n November 10, 2016,</span> the night Leonard Cohen’s death was announced, pilgrims began assembling at the doorstep of Cohen’s Montreal home to cry, pray, and lay offerings. This was just the beginning. Over the next year, the multitudes would gather to worship at Montreal’s ever more prodigious altars: two enormous murals, one of them twenty storeys high; a star-studded tribute concert; a blockbuster exhibit at Montreal’s Musée d’art contemporain. Today, it’s clear that a full-blown canonization has taken place: as a recent <em>New York Times</em> article perceptively noted, Cohen has become the “New Secular Saint of Montreal.”</p>
<p>The description is not hyperbole or metaphor but an accurate assessment of Cohen’s immaculate status in the current zeitgeist. The former enfant terrible of Canadian arts and letters&mdash;erstwhile refuser of Governor General’s Awards, ingestor of drugs on Greek islands, recipient of head on unmade beds&mdash;has transmogrified, through death, into a holy figure. The posthumous hagiography attests to the power of Cohen’s religious imagery, which arguably reached its peak in his final album, <em>You Want It Darker</em>. The haunting title track, featuring backing vocals by the Shaar Hashomayim Synagogue Choir, makes you feel like Cohen is in direct communion with God as he proclaims, in the Biblical tongue of his ancestors, “Hineni, hineni / I’m ready, my Lord.” Add to this the massive success of “Hallelujah”&mdash;ignored when first released in the ’80s, resurrected by Jeff Buckley, Rufus Wainwright, and k.&thinsp;d. lang, and currently in contention for the most overperformed song in history&mdash;and you’ve got yourself a prophet.</p>

</ul>
<p>Such is the aura of sacredness that attaches to the High Priest of Pathos that dissident views are treated as heresy. Writer and critic Anakana Schofield said it best in an essay published a month before Cohen’s death: “Be very careful challenging opinion on Leonard Cohen, it’s like bringing up someone’s ex-partner with a mistaken warm smile on your face.” Full disclosure: as the child of two Montreal-raised Jews (one of whom is, incidentally, a Leonard), I’ve been steeped in Cohen’s music/legend since I was a zygote, and my love for him abides. Still, I think it worth considering how the posthumous focus on the “later” Cohen&mdash;whose grandfatherly, fedora-clad image towers benevolently (in duplicate!) over Montreal&mdash;obscures a more complex understanding of a man who, before he became divine, was obsessed with the flesh, and not always in ways that are palatable today.</p>
<p>Given that our threshold for bad male behaviour is currently sitting at an all-time low, we can surmise that Cohen’s “ladies’ man” persona&mdash;cultivated in an era when the term still connoted “romantic artist” rather than “pickup artist”&mdash;would get less traction now. By his own admission, Cohen was never “very good” at relationships: “I had a great appetite for the company of women,” he said in a 2005 interview. “[But] I wasn’t very good at the things that a woman wanted” (read: fidelity). In his work, women are often depicted as muses&mdash;quasi-mystical figures who inspire the poet’s imagination and then conveniently disappear (cf. songs such as “Hallelujah,” “Suzanne,” “So Long, Marianne,” “Hey, That’s No Way to Say Goodbye”&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;). On the first page of his 1994 biography, <em>Leonard Cohen: A Life in Art</em>, Ira Nadel notes approvingly: “when entrapped by beauty, [Cohen] finds his art imperiled. He responds by seeking freedom, recognizing the need to dismantle love&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;for only art can truly seduce Leonard Cohen.”</p>
<p>This is a classic example of what historian Martin Jay calls the “aesthetic alibi” men have been using since the nineteenth century to justify bad behaviour. Today, the myth of the male genius has come under fire in the wake of movements such as #MeToo and Time’s Up, which have established the role of such tropes in legitimating the abusive treatment of women. This isn’t to suggest that Cohen’s dalliances were always so well received back in his heyday; just before <em>Death of a Ladies’ Man</em> (1978) was published, <em>Chatelaine</em> ran a piece called “Death of a Ladies’ Chauvinist,” which wondered whether the book would be a “rejection of his former womanizing self.” One would think that we would be hearing more of this criticism applied retroactively. For some reason, though, Cohen’s womanizing seems to have been grandfathered in. A commemorative 2016 CBC Music profile gushed, “What woman wouldn’t be flattered to be the focus of such a fiercely artistic, intellectual, romantic man?”</p>
<p>In terms of the objectification of women, Cohen’s songs (even the cringe-inducing, though admittedly rollicking, “Don’t Go Home with Your Hard-On”) are nowhere near as extreme as his fiction. This fact has not gone unremarked by the generation of undergraduates currently grappling with his two published novels, <em>The Favourite Game</em> (1963) and <em>Beautiful Losers</em> (1966). The latter, in particular, has long been a staple of CanLit syllabi; its experimental form, along with its critique of history, religion, and other metanarratives, makes it a perfect object lesson in Canadian postmodernism. Lately, though, the book has started to resemble a how-to guide for writers who want to tank their literary careers. Indigenous appropriation? Check. Misogyny and graphic sexual violence? Check.</p>
<p><em>Beautiful Losers</eM> has always shocked readers. <em>Toronto Star</em> critic Robert Fulford famously called it “the most revolting book ever written in Canada” (though, to be fair, he also called it “the most interesting Canadian book of the year”). But where cultural artifacts that are shocking in their own era tend to become less so over time, <em>Beautiful Losers</em> is one of those rare books that is more outrageous now than when it was first published. The narrator (unnamed, though I’ll follow Cohen scholars in referring to him as “I”) is “a well-known folklorist, an authority” on an Indigenous tribe he refers to throughout the novel as “the A&mdash; &mdash;s.” Today, this premise alone would be enough to warrant a terse rejection letter from potential publishers.</p>
<p>It gets worse: when the book opens, I’s wife, an A&mdash; &mdash; woman named Edith, has just died by suicide in a baroque manner involving an elevator shaft. This is but one of the many abuses Edith will endure over the course of <em>Beautiful Losers</em>, in which she will also be raped twice, first by a gang of men and then by a possessed vibrator. The narrator recounts these events with gleeful precision and essentially spends the rest of the book “touching her perfect body with his mind.” The novel’s other Indigenous character does not fare much better. I’s erotic attention falls equally on Catherine Tekakwitha, a seventeenth-century Mohawk woman who converted to Christianity and later became a saint: “I fell in love with a religious picture of you,” he announces; “You were standing among birch trees.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;God knows how far up your moccasins were laced.” Said moccasins are removed in a later scene where a lecherous priest molests her feet&mdash;recounted with a stomach-churning “Gobble-gobblegogglewoggle. Slurp.”</p>
<p>It is not surprising, given the above (to say nothing of the ubiquitous masturbation or the fact that the novel’s middle section is penned with “one hand on a letter and one hand up a juicy cunt”), that <em>Beautiful Losers</em> has been going through a bit of an identity crisis of late. In the ’70s, the famous academic Linda Hutcheon named it “the most challenging and perceptive novel about Canada and her people yet written.” In contrast, Schofield recently called it “a failed, fossilized encounter” and “prayed privately that no indigenous woman would ever have to suffer reading [it].” The book’s status in the CanLit canon, formerly unquestioned, also seems less secure these days. One literature professor I polled said he doesn’t teach the book anymore because “there are too many issues to navigate in it.” Another decided to put a trigger warning on his syllabus, cautioning “[s]tudents who ‘love Leonard Cohen’ when they enter the course” that they might be “shocked to find some of his works ethically repellent.” This proved true: a lot of his students, he told me, were indeed deeply offended, particularly by the treatment of Edith.</p>
<p>While such reactions are fully understandable, it is worth looking a little closer at what Cohen was trying to do in <em>Beautiful Losers</em>. We can glean enough from Cohen’s life and writing, including the novel, to know that he did not endorse violence against women in general or Indigenous women in particular. You could even go as far as to say that he was ahead of his time in acknowledging Canada’s colonial history before this issue really entered mainstream consciousness. The book about Catherine Tekakwitha that apparently inspired the novel was in fact lent to him by Abenaki filmmaker <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/at-ninety-one-alanis-obomsawin-is-not-ready-to-put-down-her-camera/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alanis Obomsawin</a>, a friend of his; according to scholar Randolph Lewis, many elements of Edith’s character, including the abuse, are linked to Obomsawin. Lewis argues, echoing a common interpretation, that “Cohen imagines the Native female body as a symbol of political conquest in his surreal allegory of intercultural violence.” In other words, Cohen is being ironic. You can see it in I’s use of a nationalistic explanation to explain Edith’s rape: “French Canadian schoolbooks do not encourage respect for the Indians. Some part of the Canadian Catholic mind is not certain of the Church’s victory over the Medicine Man.”</p>
<p>By current yardsticks, though, it doesn’t really matter whether Cohen was being ironic, because we have collectively rejected irony as a means of addressing systemic injustice. In the ’90s, David Foster Wallace criticized irony as “singularly unuseful when it comes to constructing anything to replace the hypocrisies it debunks.” Today, we’ve taken the critique a step further, recognizing irony’s power to uphold the very structures of power it ostensibly denounces. This is particularly true when there is a power difference between the speaker and their subject. Consider the backlash against Kenneth Goldsmith or Vanessa Place, two avant-garde white artists whose purportedly anti-racist work got them accused of, well, racism. Or, closer to home, Hal Niedzviecki’s infamous call for an “appropriation prize” for writers. If such a prize really existed, <em>Beautiful Losers</em> would probably win.</p>
<p>For these reasons, <em>Beautiful Losers</em> will likely continue its slide into the dustbin of history and, with it, our memory of the young author who wrote it, high off his face on amphetamines and sunstroke on the Greek island of Hydra. Instead, we will continue basking in the light of the elder Cohen’s towering icon while listening to saccharine covers of “Hallelujah” on repeat. And this will be a loss, for <em>Beautiful Losers</em> is an important reminder that before Cohen became a saint, he was just a flawed man. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-darker-side-of-leonard-cohen/">The Darker Side of Leonard Cohen</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

Omar Mouallem’s “<a href="https://thewalrus.ca/canadarm/">O, Canadarm</a>” (June) is a well-deserved celebration of Canadian excellence in space robotics. In that spirit, as an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia’s department of physics and astronomy, I would have also liked to see some flexing for the array of Canadian achievements in astrophysics. To name just a few: cosmic fireworks captured by the James Webb Space Telescope (with two Canadian components), mysterious bursts of radio waves measured by the world-leading Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope in British Columbia, and the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics for the true nature of ghostly neutrino particles detected by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO). Looking ahead: Canada recently announced planned investment in the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO), an ambitious radio telescope project with the potential to teach us about mysterious dark energy and the origins of life. We’re well beyond a second golden age&mdash;we’re at the beginning of an entirely new era, with Canada at the forefront of exciting discoveries far beyond the reach of our solar system.</p>

<p><strong>Social Security</strong><br />
In “<a href="https://thewalrus.ca/future-of-libraries/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Have You Been to the Library Lately?</a>” (June), Nicholas Hune-Brown draws an accurate picture of how libraries have grown to encompass social services for marginalized communities. However, he was perhaps unaware of the issue of increased workload. As a library assistant since 1976, I now have a workload double or triple what I did decades ago. When you factor in these new pressures on library workers, on top of the fact that pay has not kept step with our increased workloads, it may help explain our sagging morale. This lack of a strong social safety net reminded me of Meagan Gillmore’s exploration of Canada’s liberal Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID) program in “<a href="https://thewalrus.ca/assisted-dying/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Too Easy to Die</a>” (June). Both stories speak to a profound societal gap. If the marginalized folks I see at the library had mental health, housing, and food support, we library workers wouldn’t have to be ad hoc social workers; similarly, if people considering MAID had mental health, medical, housing, and social support, many might not choose MAID.</p>

<p><strong>Future of Choice</strong><br />
Meagan Gillmore’s exploration of why there should be more <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/assisted-dying/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guardrails against MAID</a> fails to include a major end-of-life concern for all people, regardless of income: the increasing probability of developing some form of dementia, if we live long enough. At present, there is only a very narrow window between developing symptoms of dementia and becoming incompetent to consent, and by that point, the legalities can be daunting. People need to have the option of making an advance request for MAID in the event of dementia or other long-term conditions that could seriously and permanently impair us.</p>

Having begun my university career as an English major alongside the rise of ChatGPT, I feel no inclination to use it. This is not the result of moral qualms but because the study of literature is also the study of emotions, relationships, and philosophy&mdash;all things that are deeply human. Students drawn to these complex ideas should avoid such a mechanical way of producing essays.</p>

<p><em>This story, about a kidnapping, is told on a tightrope, striking a delicious balance between horror and humour. Kathryn Kuitenbrouwer told me it “came burbling out” of her after overhearing a girl shriek about how cute the children in a passing horse-driven buggy were. “I want to steal one!” the girl exclaimed. Kuitenbrouwer went into the writing aware  of her ignorance about the Amish; she had fewer qualms satirizing the parents of children at a private alternative school, of whom she was one at the time. At its best, short fiction drops readers into an unknown and often absurd situation mid-action, dazzles them with bright and shiny prose, and leaves them mulling over what happened, both on the page and in their minds, for days and weeks and years afterward. This story does all of that.&mdash;Dafna Izenberg, features editor, November 2023 issue</em></p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t took the class</span> some doing to ambush, tackle, and finally capture the boy. They hid themselves on a stretch of the 62 just north of Ivanhoe and waited, giggling and getting grossed out when Markus let a fluffy. They’d done their best to work it all out in advance, but no one had properly committed to any one aspect of the job. Their approach was puerile. It was all just “We’ll stop the carriage, distract the driver, and someone will grab one of the littlies&mdash;oh my God, they are so cute.”</p>
<p>The fart hovered at nose level as the nostalgic clop of horses sounded and a decision became necessary. There was a great deal of wide-eyed buck passing until Becky said, “Screw this and screw you guys,” and threw herself up out of the ditch, tumbling almost acrobatically to stand right in the way of the two horses trotting up the highway. Becky held a short willow branch she had picked up along the way. She faced the oncoming Amish buggy and stretched out her arms. There were certain children left in the ditch wishing they had taken this initiative, energized by her raw courage.</p>
<p>The buggy driver pulled up with a “Ho!” as the horses shortened their trot and stopped, hoofing the dirt right where Becky stood.</p>

<p>Myra shimmied along the ditch toward the back of the carriage. The others followed. Behind the bearded man was a little boy, dressed identically to him, in a wee blue shirt and a wee straw hat. Myra whispered, “My pet! Oh, isn’t he darling?”</p>
<p>Becky waved her hands to distract the man. “Excuse me, sir,” she said.</p>
<p>The man cocked his head and ­waited. He seemed amused, as if regular people were strange and delightful simply ­because he could not predict them. He was unlike anyone Becky had ever seen. His shirt was not crisp and clean but mud or (oh, my) manure splattered, and it was fastened with safety pins. Was it possible that this man’s wife was a bad ­domestic, despite being loved in the eyes of God?</p>
<p>Becky tried to keep the man’s attention so the class could gain time. They were about to edge around the side of the buggy, where the little boy sat watching her, enrapt, she supposed, by her pink legs, denim cut-offs, and cherry-red tank top.</p>
<p>“How many Amish . . . ?” Becky asked earnestly (and here she raised the willow switch, noting at the same time that the class almost had their hands upon the boy). “How many Amish, sir, does it take to screw in a light bulb?”</p>
<p>William’s palm covered the boy’s mouth as the girls yanked the child out of his seat and surrounded him. It was as quiet as such a thing could be, and ­before the man noticed the boy was missing, Becky brought the stick down on the nose of one of the horses. The man’s face went from curious to querulous. Perhaps he was wondering about the light bulb, or lining up that this was a joke, however bad, and that it was on him. She switched the horses again and again. The two beasts reared, shocked and then furious at the maltreatment. The man yelled, then whipped and cajoled the horses to move. This was better than perfect. He wanted to get away! Becky moved to the soft shoulder to watch the class pet and adore the boy while the black buggy receded into the distance. She marvelled at the great space opening up between these two things.</p>
<p>The child was much younger than they had realized. He had doughnuts of flesh under his knees and around his wrists that smelled faintly of milk and love.</p>
<p>“Let us call him Puppy,” said Myra.</p>
<p>William told her not to be stupid. “He is <em>the Amish</em>,” he said. “We decided this long ago.”</p>
<p>“The Amish,” Markus repeated and lifted his leg to toot.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">hey had snuck</span> from their tents this fine morning, before the spring dew dried on the grass, and come back with their prize. They were the grade six class of the city’s one true Waldorf school. Led by the lanky Erik McAuley&mdash;who for three years prior to his teacher training had followed a troop of Viking re-enactors around the fjords&mdash;the small, airtight class was camping this week at a farm owned by William’s parents. Mr. McAuley cocked his head thoughtfully. The boy was maybe four. “Where did you find him?”</p>
<p>“He was lying curled like a caterpillar on the side of the road,” Becky said. “It was more of a rescue.” She felt they had the story worked out.</p>
<p>“At first,” added Markus, “we thought it was a turtle. We were hoping for turtles.”</p>
<p>“But instead it was a boy?” said Mr. McAuley.</p>
<p>“An Amish,” corrected Myra. “We shall keep him as a class pet.”</p>
<p>Mr. McAuley’s eyebrows dropped over his eyes. The hairs were red and extravagant, even in so young a man. Several strays looped out from the pack, giving him a foxy look the children adored. “We cannot keep someone’s child,” he said.</p>
<p>“An abandoned child,” asserted William, and the other seven children, even the shyer ones, chimed in, almost shrieking, that they must keep the Amish. They must.</p>
<p>The Amish sat cross legged, picking blades of grass and gathering them into a bouquet in his plump hand. He held them to his face and blew at their tips, playing at being the wind and rustling them. Mr. McAuley and the children watched him crumple after a time and sink to sleep on the farmhouse lawn, a heap of blue cotton and baby flesh, the straw hat having slipped off his head in the process. It lay next to him, glowing round.</p>
<p>“Someone will surely miss him,” Mr. McAuley said. “You don’t just leave a child on the side of the road.”</p>
<p>“But that is exactly what we thought when we saw him,” said Becky. “And so we took him.” The last bit was the only true thing any of them had yet uttered.</p>
<p>The Amish was cherubic in sleep, the bouquet of grass clutched in his fist. The children looked back and forth, watching Mr. McAuley watch the boy and seeing his heart melt.</p>
<p>“What we should really do is call the police,” he said, but by the way he said it, the children knew he would not. Then, without conviction, he muttered, “The school won’t approve,” and the children rose up into a hurrah. A celebration ensued around the prone Amish. Spontaneously, the class held hands&mdash;and pulled Mr. McAuley to their cause&mdash;and formed into a fairy circle, dancing back and forth around the foundling, as they had already come to think of him. They sang a dirge-like song, a round, that sprang from the earth into their mouths.</p>
<p>They already loved him so.</p>
<p>They brought the Amish around the property when he woke, admonishing him about areas where he was not allowed&mdash;the ancient pop bottle mound under the ragged hedge that bordered the northern verge of the civilized part of the land, where the old limestone house sat, and also the pond, which had a sludgy, dangerous beach. They took him to the pioneer dump in the western field and held up blue and amber medicine jars, indicating the corroded metal lids and the menacing shards where things had broken, and waggling their index fingers to convey simple boundaries. The boy never spoke during all this time, and it was only by the way he moved his pretty mouth, and looked in wonder at them all, that they knew he was listening.</p>
<p>“The Amish people don’t speak English,” said Mr. McAuley.</p>
<p>“Mr. McAuley?” said William, by way of diverting the conversation. “It must be time to start lunch.” The children did not wish to learn anything about the Amish. They only wanted the feeling that seemed to come from him.</p>
<p>“Beans and wieners!” Mr. McAuley said and turned to march toward the house. “Who is on schedule to help?”</p>
<p>William and Myra scrambled after Mr. McAuley, chanting, “Beans and wieners! Beans and wieners!” They were already thinking of rhymes for this: “Makes you meaner, keeps you cleaner.”</p>
<p>William thrust his hips out on “wieners” and whispered, “Look, look,” to Myra, who did not get it.</p>
<p>Becky muttered how she hated wieners, and that is when the eyes of the Amish wildly lit up, and he said, “Wienerwienerwiener,” very quickly.</p>
<p>“Say it again,” said Becky. She hugged the Amish, delighted that he had finally spoken. “Say it again! Do you like wieners? Do you?” She peered into his eyes and shook him a little. The Amish smiled. “Wiener,” he said. He had a raspy voice, which served to shift Becky’s idea of what an angelic voice might really sound like, so that in the end, it gave her insights into a heaven she had never thought possible. “Wiener,” the Amish repeated.</p>
<p>Becky straightened his little hat. “The wieners,” she said, “are 100 percent organic. We also have a vegan option.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he Amish</span> pulled the wiener from the crease of the bun and wiped off the ketchup using the lawn.</p>
<p>Myra said, “What’s he doing?”</p>
<p>“Shh, we must observe,” said Mr. McAuley, taking on an air, pedagogically speaking, of loving compassion.</p>
<p>The class sat decorously around the now-cold campfire, having sung a blessing, closed eyes, and looked inward, and were trying for the sake of anthropology not to interfere in any way with the Amish’s experience. Clutching the tube of meat in his pudgy right hand, the Amish wandered around the class, taking bites.</p>
<p>When he finished the wiener, they gave him another, and this he kept tucked into his hand for the rest of the afternoon, so they had to wonder at the significance and whisper about it among themselves. When they asked Mr. McAuley, he nodded in a knowing way but would not answer.</p>
<p>The significance seemed to grow in the late afternoon when menacing weather cracked the sky open. Lightning and the approaching rain forced the children and Mr. McAuley to make haste with the tents, the sky tumultuous behind and around them. The foundling, his hot dog held aloft, scurried across the lawn while they dragged the sodden tents into the farmhouse, yelling joyfully. Becky first called, then sang to the Amish, holding the screen door open, until finally he ran in, his wiener frayed but intact. He was soaking wet.</p>
<p>Becky took her beach towel and rubbed him all over, carefully drying his eyes and trying to wick some of the moisture from his clothes. But when she accidentally patted him too brusquely and the hot dog broke in two, the Amish began to weep. The children nestled close to him, cooed, and watched him take bites&mdash;the pieces now tucked into both of his hands&mdash;first from one half, then the other. The storm continued. Myra stood to turn on a light as dusk fell, and that is when they learned that the house had lost power.</p>
<p>“Class,” said Mr. McAuley, “if things don’t improve by morning, we’ll head back to the city.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he poor weather</span> did not abate and the power did not return, so they packed everything into the van. The question of what to do with the Amish was circumvented when Myra reminded the class that her mother was a social welfare lawyer and would surely know how to go about adoption or fostering and generally managing the situation. Myra used the term “due processes,” which impressed all of them. She smiled at the Amish and told him not to worry, then herded him up into the back of the twelve-seater van. They had eaten muffins for breakfast&mdash;William’s nana had made them&mdash;and though the boy had taken just one small test bite, he had still managed to smear chocolate along his chin.</p>
<p>The ride was raucous, with the boys teaching the Amish how to curl his tongue in several different ways, how to pop his cheek, how to make wet fart sounds with the snap of his armpit over his cupped palm. They taught him the word “shit” and how to muffle it into a cough. The Amish pulled the skin under his eyes down with the first two fingers of one hand and shoved his nose up with the index of the other, and the children laughed. Somewhere west of Pickering, Mr. McAuley announced, “I have texted that we’re returning. You’ll be picked up at the school by your parents unless permission has been explicitly given that you may take city transit home. Becky will keep the Amish through the weekend.”</p>
<p>“Why should Becky get to keep him?”</p>
<p>“William’s got the bigger house,” asserted Markus.</p>
<p>“And a pool,” added William. “We’ve got this whale,” he said and turned to the boy. “You can float on it!” The Amish didn’t have a bathing suit, but William would have his parents stop at the Walmart. “Why does Becky always get what she wants?” said William. “It isn’t fair.”</p>
<p>Becky silenced the calls for fairness. “I sorted it out, is all.” She had, in fact, sat up at the front petitioning her parents for one and a half concerted hours. Her onslaught of text and voice messages had begun politely but ascended to whining and finally threats. Her parents were well aware that she would never throw herself from the Viaduct (and, anyway, the very sensible installation of a suicide veil had made this impossible), but the verve with which she argued marvelled them, and they buckled. It would be temporary, they said, and she agreed. Secretly, she knew they would fall in love with the Amish once they met him. Her father had always wanted a son.</p>
<p>“After the weekend,” said Mr. McAuley, “we’ll rotate taking care of him until we figure out what’s to be done,” and here he offered gratitude to Myra for the projected help her mother might offer. Then he added, “The school has agreed to this living history lesson only if we proceed with due diligence and follow the letter of the law.”</p>
<p>At the mention of the law, there was much shushing. They reached their hands back and petted the Amish and sang a round. Then, in the last half hour of the journey, they decided they would sew clothes such as he was used to wearing and mend his hat with straw when it required this. They would watch his diet while trying to ascertain what a more accurate one might be, wieners and . . . they did not know, but determined to find out. And for the rest&mdash;William’s pool, the cottage Myra’s family had inherited in Muskoka&mdash;these would clearly improve the boy’s lot.</p>
<p>“His new situation will evolve him,” said Becky, as if he were emerging from the swamps of the Paleozoic.</p>
<p>William scoffed and said, “We just can’t know, Becky.”</p>
<p>The van had the collective atmosphere of ten brooding preadolescents, their next moves grown fetid from waiting. It had become a holding tank for their futures&mdash;and the future of the Amish as they now imagined it. How they longed to arrive!</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smallcaps">ecky stood</span> on the front steps of the school, still and stoic, the Amish having wrapped his plump arm tight around her leg as the cars drove up and swallowed the other students. “There,” she said as her parents’ Beemer finally took the corner, slow and cool. Becky slid her palm along the boy’s cheek, watching as her father emerged glorious and elegant from the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>“Daughter!” Chuck Buckley said and clutched Becky in the briefest of greetings. “And this,” he added, “must be the foundling!”</p>
<p>“He’s very tired, Father,” said Becky.</p>
<p>She lifted the Amish and tucked him in the back seat. “I believe he needs a doughnut. And possibly a hot dog.”</p>
<p>“We are going home,” Chuck said as they pulled away from the school. “Your mother has been slaving in the kitchen all morning.”</p>
<p>“But she doesn’t know his dietary needs.”</p>
<p>“I believe she googled them.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">my Buckley pulled</span> the door open before her family even stepped out of the car. “Oh my God,” she said. “Hello!”</p>
<p>Becky held her hands out to the foundling and half pulled, half helped him down out of the car and into the laneway. He was sweaty and dirty. The Amish looked up at Chuck and said, “Father,” and Becky watched her dad’s heart chakra soften. The boy reached a hand up and tugged on the edge of Chuck’s summer wool sports jacket and smiled. Chuck moved around to the trunk, and the boy trailed behind.</p>
<p>“Mother, this is the Amish.” Becky gently moved the boy toward her mother, then leaned down to make eye contact with him. “This is Mother,” she said to him and pointed. “Mother.”</p>
<p>“Mother,” said the boy.</p>
<p>“His first words,” Becky lied.</p>
<p>“Well!” It was clear that her parents were both moved. “So nice to meet you, little boy,” said Amy, and then a look of panic drained her face of all colour. “Shit,” she said. “Shit.” She fluttered her hands.</p>
<p>“Shit,” said the boy, converting the word to a cough.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">my Buckley</span> had made frog’s-eye salad, a selection of Jell-O-suspended cold-cut dishes, and funeral potatoes. These were remarkable, all set out on the dining table in anticipation of the guest. A Mormon feast. “It’s completely inappropriate,” she whimpered, tucking each dish into the refrigerator. Then she barked out a little laugh and said, “Have you any clue?”</p>
<p>“I know he likes wieners,” said Becky. “And I think I saw corn growing at one of the farms.”</p>
<p>“When does he need returning?” said Chuck. “What’s his telephone number?”</p>
<p>“Father,” Becky said, “the Amish eschew technology. Besides, I believe he is adoptable. Myra’s mother will be conducting a process on this.”</p>
<p>Chuck’s eyebrows shot up. “Really?” he said. “I mean, if he were my son, I would be looking for him. Just look at him. He’s absolutely adorable.”</p>
<p>Becky glowed at the “if he were my son” and said, “I don’t expect anyone will be looking for him. He was left on the side of the highway.”</p>
<p>Amy said, “The poor dear,” and then, “Do you think he’d like merguez sausages?”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he Amish</span> dipped the lamb sausage into a pool of yellow mustard on his plate. He ate mustard exclusively that first night. And the second as well. The Buckleys googled and made various internet-approved Amish dishes, but the boy refused them. The fat that had so darlingly wrapped around his knees and wrists began to look flaccid and grey. Becky spent an hour searching out Amish websites and coming up empty. “There just isn’t much online.”</p>
<p>The Amish grew listless and clingy.</p>
<p>He would not sleep in the spare room. He would not get in the bed, nor even stay put in the room. So they set up a cot at the end of Becky’s captain’s bed, and by morning he was snuggled in next to her, holding her neck with his open hands. When she moved, he startled, so she had to lie very still until he woke up.</p>
<p>“Don’t die,” she whispered to him. “I love you, little Amish boy.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he Amish was kneeling</span> in the corner of the classroom, his eyes closed tight and his fingers clasped together. “What’s he doing?” Myra said.</p>
<p>“He’s praying,” said Mr. McAuley.</p>
<p>“For what?” Markus was bending down to inspect the boy.</p>
<p>“There are some,” answered Mr. McAuley, “who just make it a habit to pray.” He was thinking of his mother, who prayed under her breath at all times of the day. “They believe their prayers have weight. They believe that by praying they are in service to mankind.”</p>
<p>William looked back and forth from the Amish to Mr. McAuley. “It’s foolhardy. He should be made to stop.” This comment so charged the air, it was clear to them all that a discussion was about to be opened. Already, Mr. McAuley had taken a deep chestful of air to sustain himself for the response he would give. Live and let live, respect the cultures of others, but none of it was necessary as the Amish quickly unclasped his hands and flew once around the room before landing in Becky’s lap.</p>
<p>“He hasn’t eaten a thing besides French’s mustard these last days,” she told the class. “We tried hot dogs, but he seems to have gone off them. I am beginning to be concerned.”</p>
<p>She was beyond concerned. Through the night, she had dreamt of feeding him raisins and then Smarties, such that she had not slept well but had hovered in that superficial sleep that offers no respite. She had grown surly as a result.</p>
<p>The Amish had his hands around her neck and his face nestled into her shoulder. She tried to pull him off, but he went rigid. “Mother,” he said. “Father, mother, wiener, mother, father,” and then he said her name.</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” she said. “Not Becky.” She knew she would have been thrilled by this only days before.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you happy he says your name?” said Myra. She wished the boy would say her name. She scratched along her arms out of anxiety.</p>
<p>“Stop that, Myra. You’re tearing your skin.”</p>
<p>Myra replied, “My mother says our rescue is actionable. She says if we weren’t minors, we could all go to jail for a very long time. And that we have to return him before it gets out of hand. And apologize.” Myra gave a wide smile to Mr. McAuley. “I’ve made a card for us to sign! It’s in my backpack.”</p>
<p>Markus made a fart noise with his mouth, right up close to the Amish, but the foundling just tucked his face deeper into Becky’s collarbone. “Oh, what’s the use?” Markus said. “He’s really no fun.”</p>
<p>“Mr. McAuley, you should never have let us,” wailed Becky. She was wondering what, exactly, Myra had said to her mother. Myra had clearly not stuck to script. “Mr. McAuley, it was very irresponsible of you to have done so.”</p>
<p>Mr. McAuley slumped on his teacher stool, the one he’d built as part of his teacher training. It had Viking markings on it and symbols denoting the future so that, metaphorically, it gazed both backward and forward. He seemed to have no spine. “Children,” he said. “Let me think, please. Afford me some quiet, I beg you.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smallcaps">r. McAuley thought</span> back to the great Wulfin battle of 2008. He had shaved the hair over his ears for that and grown out his straggly beard. He had purchased stainless steel chain mail and a fine helmet. He’d learned some metallurgy. He’d brandished a replica axe and a festooned spear. He recalled the heft of steel clothing, the way it made him feel . . . glorious and impervious and, he would admit only to himself, horny. It was a marvellous combination. He wished himself back on the battlefield with his comrades, fighting a mock war. It was real, as real as anything, and maybe more real. Mr. McAuley looked deeply, intently, at the Amish.</p>
<p>“We must live our dreams,” he said.</p>
<p>Becky flashed to the raisins and Smarties metronomically popping into the foundling’s mouth, the waft of disdain over his little tired face. She preferred not to live her dreams.</p>
<p>“The Amish is signalling to us our worst impulses,” Mr. McAuley whispered.</p>
<p>It was as if their teacher were in a trance. A hammer came down upon his helmet. Life force sprang up his legs and flowed through his every limb. He yelled in the full embodiment of his very self. He was alive!</p>
<p>“Mr. McAuley?” The children came closer to peer at him. “Are you all right?”</p>
<p>Erik McAuley was about to translate his Viking past into something useful, but already he lagged behind current events. The Amish had unwound from Becky and was running toward the windows on the east side of the room, his eyes widened in some sort of recognition.</p>
<p>Veeshla, the school secretary, stood in the doorway of the classroom, her blond hair groomed into a ponytail. “You have a visitor,” she said. “Outside.” She lifted her eyebrows to indicate urgency. She pointed to the window. The foundling had somehow pulled himself onto the shelf and was standing, pressed wholly&mdash;each bit of his front&mdash;up against the glass.</p>
<p>Becky tried to pull him back. She feared he would break through and plummet. “You mustn’t, you mustn’t,” she cooed, trying to suppress the tiny scream that bubbled in her throat. She had already seen what was below. It was a black buggy pulled by two sweat-shiny mares.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he man wore</span> an immaculate blue shirt, crisply pressed, with finely sewn-on buttons. His beard was combed so that it spread over his chest. His hat appeared brand new. His black trousers were creased, and the buggy itself was glowing clean. There was a woman in a bonnet in the back. Neither of them said a word, nor did they look from side to side. Myra flung the handmade, never-signed card at the father. The class chorused their apologies, and Becky lifted the Amish up and into the carriage. The couple still did not turn but only nodded. Their silence was so magnetic that the class experienced an electric guilt so nervous, so amplified, and so permanent they began one by one to sob.</p>
<p>The father flicked the reins, and the horses burst into a trot. And here is where the foundling began to cry too, first soft heaves down in his wee belly but then audibly and inconsolably. His mother watched him. He was screaming before the carriage reached the corner, and he had climbed up the seat. He peered through the rectangular opening in the back of the carriage, his chubby hands gripping either side of the cut-out window. The class stood in the middle of the road and watched him, anguished. William made to run after the vehicle, but Mr. McAuley held him back.</p>
<p>And what nobody could agree on later, but which Becky knew was true, it clung to her so painfully and so indelibly, was the form his screams took. “Becky!” he cried. “Becky! Becky!” His arms flung out the hole in the buggy, reaching back, back toward them.</p>
<p>“I will find them when I get back to the farm,” said William, nobly, to placate poor Becky, who had stolen a living child, after all, and must feel horrid.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n the weeks</span> that followed, Mr. McAuley led debriefing sessions in which the children were encouraged to grieve. </p>
<p>“Life is a battle,” he confided to Veeshla in the staff lunchroom during this trying time, and she replied that he “hadn’t better tell this to the children.” The story&mdash;for it was becoming one&mdash;was replayed and revised until it was felt that the wounds were sufficiently healed. Still, no one was alarmed when a game sprang up involving the theft of a sad “It” who must then escape. The class played the Amish Game fervently through middle school until the end of grade eight, when they graduated and lost contact with one another. William’s father eventually sold the farm to pay for college. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/care-and-feeding-of-the-amish/">Care and Feeding of the Amish</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>This story contains details about sexual assault that some readers may find disturbing.</em></p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t was late</span> January 2015, after midnight, when one of the few female officers at the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary received a call on her police radio. “Unknown trouble,” said the dispatcher. A woman was upset. She had been drinking, was confused by her whereabouts, and feared for her safety.</p>
<p>“I’ll go,” constable Kelsey Muise radioed back.</p>
<p>Muise (then using her maiden name Aboud) pulled over when she saw a young woman with dark hair and glasses standing on the side of Newfoundland Drive in St. John’s. The woman, known today only as Jane Doe, asked to be taken to a friend’s house. In the back seat of the patrol car, she said, “I need to tell you something.” Jane Doe gulped back air and began crying hysterically. Muise pulled into a convenience store parking lot and flicked on the dome light. She turned to her passenger to better take in what she was saying. </p>

<p>As Jane Doe would later explain in court, she’d left a bar shortly after 3 a.m. four days before Christmas. She descended an alleyway of stairs and stepped into a downtown street. She was drunk and wanted to go home. Scanning for a taxi, she noticed a patrol car close by. She discussed a ride home with the policeman, and he unlocked the back door. A cop was safer than a cabbie, she figured, and got in.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, they pulled up outside her basement apartment. Jane Doe couldn’t find her keys. The officer discovered an unlocked kitchen window and slid it open for her to climb through. He came to the back door to make sure she was okay, and Jane Doe let him in. The two stood talking in her living room. They kissed, and then, feeling too drunk to stand, Jane Doe sat on her brown loveseat. She passed out and came to at the sound of the police officer’s voice. She was naked, and he was standing over her, penetrating her anally. He said he’d missed two call-outs and had to go. Jane Doe recalled seeing him in her bathroom, adjusting his uniform. The whole encounter, a jury would later learn, from the time the police officer parked outside the apartment to when he left, lasted about nineteen minutes.</p>

</ul>
<p>The next morning, Jane Doe awoke in bed, confused. Her flowered crop top and purple high-waisted pants were strewn on the living room floor. There were muddy footprints on the white kitchen countertop. It hurt to go to the washroom. And there were friction burns on the inside of her thighs. She also noticed bruises on her legs.</p>
<p>In the back of Muise’s cruiser, Jane Doe’s story came tumbling out. She didn’t even know the name of the police officer who had driven her home. All she knew was he had short hair, was taller than her, and looked like he was in his thirties. Over the course of the month since the assault, Jane Doe had wavered between blaming herself and wondering if she could have stopped or changed what happened. She felt too scared to go to the police. “Who’s going to believe me?” she confided to a friend at the time.</p>
<p>After more than an hour, Muise drove Jane Doe home and hugged her goodbye. Someone would be in touch, she said. Then Muise took a deep breath. She had witnessed inappropriate and illegal sexual behaviour at the RNC before. It had always been brushed aside. But she vowed it would be different this time. She wasn’t about to let this one go.

<div class="main_housing" style="max-width: 728px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" style="margin: 0.8075em 0; padding-bottom:2.5em;">Kelsey Muise outside her Newfoundland home</figcaption><p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he Royal</span> Newfoundland Constabulary, one of the oldest police forces in North America, was officially founded in 1871. For more than a century prior to that, British soldiers had helped police St. John’s, but when Britain decided to withdraw its garrison from the port city in 1870, Newfoundland was left to set up its own force to maintain law and order. The next year, a notice appeared in the Royal Gazette. “Wanted, a few strong active young men between 19 and 27 years of age,” read the ad. “They must be well recommended for honesty, sobriety, and fidelity.” The Newfoundland Constabulary moved into Fort Townshend, the former headquarters of the British garrison, where it remains today in a modern brick and glass building. About 400 officers serve the major towns and cities in the province.</p>
<p>The RNC swore in its first female members in 1980&mdash;six years later than the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which also patrols rural areas in the province. Women had already been part of the constabulary for more than two decades by the time Muise arrived, at age twenty, shortly after graduating from the Atlantic Police Academy in Prince Edward Island. She was blonde with green eyes and a shy smile. She’d grown up around the police officers who visited her father’s tow truck business at their home in Sydney, Nova Scotia. Those officers were kind and friendly, and as she got older, Muise realized she wanted to help people like they did. As a kid, she tried to rescue every stray cat and dog she encountered. Once, at a movie theatre with her mother, she got up and sat with an elderly man who was sitting alone.</p>
<p>Arriving in a new city where she had her own apartment and car felt freeing and exciting. But it wasn’t long before she started to see, as a patrol officer, the harshness of the real world, one where men threw women through walls and beat their faces bloody.</p>
<p>She often took flak, for being so young and also a woman, from people she was arresting.</p>
<p>“What are you gonna do?”</p>
<p>“Are you even old enough to be here?”</p>
<p>And so she’d hit the gym, to lift weights, so that even if those around her didn’t think she could handle herself, she knew she could. She was stationed in the west district where, at the time, there were a handful of female officers. The first time she remembers a colleague saying something unsettling to her was in the parking lot of the police station. “How many fucking batteries does your baton take?” a much older constable asked. Muise, taken aback, laughed stiffly. She felt she had to try to fit in.</p>
<p>It became obvious that some of her fellow male officers didn’t see her as one of them. She recalled walking into a meeting room and glancing around for a seat. One officer tipped his head back and waggled his tongue in the air. “You can sit right here,” he said as the room full of men chortled in unison. She’d grown up with an older brother and was familiar with juvenile male behaviour, but this was far worse than she had expected.</p>
<p>That same year, an officer brandished a furry highway patrol hat in front of his crotch. “Does your curtain match your drapes?” he asked as the room erupted in laughter. Embarrassed, Muise walked away. These were the people who were supposed to be protecting women?</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">fter meeting</span> Jane Doe, Muise took a moment to collect herself. She knew how rare it was for survivors to come forward in the first place. She had heard about male colleagues declaring reports of sexual violence “unfounded,” or baseless. That meant no arrest, no trial, no conviction and no punishment. So, instead of filing a report in the computer system as she normally would, Muise turned in a handwritten report to the active sergeant that night&mdash;someone she trusted. The complaint moved swiftly up her chain of command and ended up with the RNC unit that deals with sexual assault cases.</p>
<p>Later that morning, sergeant Tim Hogan was at home when his work cellphone rang. A seasoned cop in charge of the child abuse and sexual assault unit, he was ordered to take over the investigation. Hogan arranged for Jane to be interviewed that weekend and listened as she tearfully recounted the assault. He felt certain there was enough to continue the investigation, but he had to move quickly. Careful to loop in only senior staff to stop news of the investigation from spreading, Hogan brought on the supervisor of the police communications centre. At the time, the centre used GPS to monitor the location of police vehicles. The supervisor searched those records, looking for the cars signed out on the night of the assault. They showed car number 221 had been parked outside Jane Doe’s address. Communication logs revealed that dispatch had called for the officer twice around 3 a.m.</p>
<p>Next, Hogan and a forensic identification sergeant visited Jane Doe’s apartment. She showed them where the assault had occurred, then she waited outside with her family. The sergeant shone a UV light on the middle of her brown loveseat and saw an effervescent blue glow, signalling the presence of human bodily fluid. He unzipped the cushion cover and sent it to a lab.</p>
<p>Hogan knew it would be difficult to keep the investigation quiet within the constabulary. There was no way they could use their own surveillance teams. His supervisor reached out to the RCMP, and Hogan asked them to help surveil the suspected officer and obtain a DNA sample.</p>
<p>On a drizzly day in February, the Mounties staked out an off-duty cop at a local Starbucks in St. John’s. When he got up to leave, they snagged the white ceramic mug he had been drinking from and slipped it into an evidence bag. The DNA from the loveseat was a near-perfect match of the DNA from the mug. It belonged to Carl Douglas Snelgrove, a thirty-seven-year-old married street patrol cop. He had been on the force for a decade.</p>
<p>That summer, an officer arrested Snelgrove and read him his rights, the same words Snelgrove had said to others over the years. This time, he was one of the bad guys.

<div class="main_housing" style="max-width: 728px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps"> year</span> and a half later, in 2017, Jane Doe trudged up the stone steps of the fortress-like Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador. She wore her first ever suit&mdash;a black polyester jacket and slacks carefully purchased at the mall after she googled “what to wear in court.”</p>
<p>In the courtroom, Jane sat on a wooden bench alongside her parents, sister-in-law, an aunt, and some cousins. Her two brothers, who had always looked out for her, were absent; they couldn’t face being in the same room with the cop who had violated their baby sister.</p>
<p>The odds were against her. Winning a sexual assault conviction against a cop is hard. A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08974454.2022.2126744" rel="noopener" target="_blank">September 2022 study</a> by Kate Puddister and Danielle McNabb, published in <em>Women &#038; Criminal Justice</em>, looked at this problem in Ontario, <a href="https://theconversation.com/convictions-remain-rare-when-police-are-accused-of-sexual-assault-194965">analyzing</a> the outcomes of 689 reports of police-involved sexual assault made to the Special Investigations Unit, a police oversight agency, between 2005 and 2020. According to the findings, only 7.4 percent of those reports resulted in criminal charges, and only 1.59 percent ended in a conviction and sentence. It’s not difficult to see why the rate is so low. Cases often hang on the credibility of the complainant versus that of the accused. And here police have advantages. They enjoy built-in authority in the justice system&mdash;a system they know their way around.</p>
<p>This was the institutional machinery and lopsided dynamic that Jane Doe faced as she took the stand, reliving the night of the assault and describing it in detail. The job of undermining Jane Doe’s story went to Randy Piercey, Snelgrove’s defence lawyer at the time. Piercey maintained that all sexual activity was consensual. Throughout the trial, he tried to chip away at the claim that Jane Doe had felt coerced. He focused on her choices after leaving the bar the night of the assault. </p>
<p>“Why did you go alone?”</p>
<p>“Why not go to your friends?”</p>
<p>“You felt confident enough to go get a cab at that hour of the morning by yourself?”</p>
<p>At one point, Piercey showed the jury a photo of the basement window Jane Doe had climbed through, to argue that she wasn’t as intoxicated as she said she was.</p>
<p>“Did you have any difficulty getting through that window?”</p>
<p>“No,” she said.</p>
<p>“Even at your size, I imagine it was difficult to get in through that window?”</p>
<p>“No,” she said. “Not for me.”</p>
<p>The lawyer asked her to describe the counter height and whether she had any trouble getting down: “Would you agree that, even sober, that would not be an easy thing to do&mdash;climb into the window onto the countertop and down onto the floor?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” she said.  </p>
<p>“OK, but you can imagine, sober&mdash;is that something you would want to be doing every day?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Jane Doe.</p>
<p>“So, I would suggest to you that you would appear to be sober when you did that,” said Piercey.</p>
<p>“OK,” she whispered.</p>
<p>“Would you agree or disagree?”</p>
<p>“Well, I wasn’t,” she said.</p>
<p>“But if someone was looking at you, and saw what you were doing, would that not give them a message about your degree of intoxication?”</p>
<p>“I guess,” she said.</p>
<p>Piercey seized on the fact that Jane Doe had told police she couldn’t remember whether she consented or not. He argued that not only created reasonable doubt about her level of drunkenness but left open the possibility she was aware enough to make decisions&mdash;including agreeing to sexual activity. Later, when Snelgrove took the stand, he delivered his script: she didn’t seem drunk, she invited him in, she took her clothes off, she wanted it. To Jane Doe, he sounded confident, cocky even. Dudley Do-Right tricked into unzipping his pants.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he case against</span> Snelgrove rested on the definition of consent. Sexual activity in Canada is legal only when both parties agree to it, and, as the courts have interpreted it, consent must be communicated voluntarily and affirmatively, either through words or conduct. It can’t be inferred from silence or passivity. </p>
<p>Crucially, the criminal code has a provision for situations where the accused has abused their position of trust, power, or authority to commit a sexual crime. Crown prosecutor Lloyd Strickland argued that the presiding judge, justice Valerie Marshall, needed to instruct the jury on that provision. The Crown was confident that the jury would come to see that Jane Doe could not have consented because she was either unconscious or too drunk. But even if she had said yes, the Crown maintained, this still didn’t meet the legal threshold for consent: Snelgrove could have induced her into sexual activity by exploiting her feelings of trust in him.</p>
<p class="pull-quote">Consent must be communicated either through words or conduct. It can’t be inferred from silence or passivity.</p>
<p>Justice Marshall wouldn’t accept that. Because Jane Doe could not recall what had happened, the judge pointed out, there wasn’t enough evidence that Snelgrove had attempted to leverage his position to gain consent. It was thus unfair, she argued, to instruct the jury on this aspect of the law. And so, uninstructed, the jury never considered it.</p>
<p>It took two days for jurors to declare Snelgrove not guilty. Immediately after the foreperson uttered the words, Jane Doe was whisked, sobbing, out the back of the courtroom by supporters.</p>
<p>Outside, a protest erupted. A crowd lingered on the steps of the courthouse until nightfall, chanting, “No excuse for violent men.” The next day, the courthouse door had been pelted with eggs. The downtown was defaced with graffiti: “Believe victims,” someone had sprayed in white letters. “St. Johns cops believe in rape” and “Fuck u RNC.”</p>
<p>Jane Doe, encouraged by the protest, decided to keep fighting. The Crown appealed on her behalf and won. Her lawyers argued that the jury should have been allowed to consider the power differential. In the fall of 2018, two of three appeal court judges agreed, a decision later upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2019. “It would have been open to the jury to conclude,” wrote Supreme Court justice Michael Moldaver, that “the accused took advantage of the complainant who was highly intoxicated and vulnerable, by using the personal feelings and confidence engendered by their relationship to secure her apparent consent to sexual activity.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada decision paved the way for a new trial. By then, it had been five Christmases since Jane Doe had stepped into Snelgrove’s patrol car. After months of being jolted awake at night, sweaty and scared, she had started on new antidepressants and completed two programs at community college. Still, she felt stagnant, like she couldn’t heal. St. John’s no longer felt safe. She worried she’d run into him. So she moved to a remote cove hours away.</p>
<p>The retrial was set for March 2020 but took place in September due to pandemic delays. Proceedings were held in a former school in St. John’s to allow for physical distancing. The case captured the attention of the island again, but things unexpectedly unravelled. About eight days in, before the verdict was delivered, the presiding judge declared a mistrial after improperly dismissing two jurors.</p>
<p>Jane Doe, increasingly exasperated, agreed to try again. A third trial, under a different judge, took place in the same building in May 2021. The city blossomed with support. There were signs, some hand drawn, in the windows of homes, cars, and businesses all over St. John’s. “Three trials is too many,” said one. “We believe survivors,” said another. A woman painted rocks with messages of support and tucked them beside the hyacinth and heathers of her garden. Students hung banners in solidarity. Many updated their social media profiles with a post that said #SupportForJaneDoe.

If you start to feel angry, ask for a break, she recalled being told by the Crown and victim services. On the stand, Snelgrove’s lawyer pressed her about her decision to seek advice from a litigation lawyer in the early days of the police investigation. Piercey seemed to suggest what Jane Doe was really after was a cash settlement. “You wanted to find out if this jury is going to find him guilty, then you will pursue him civilly,” Piercey said to her during cross-examination.</p>
<p>“No,” Jane Doe cried. “I just want this over.”</p>
<p>Piercey swung again. He accused Jane Doe of waiting for the outcome of the trial before going forward with a suit. He kept needling, trying to get her to say she was going to sue. “If they convict, you’ll consider it?” he asked.</p>
<p>“It’s a consideration,” yelled Jane Doe. “I just don’t know.”</p>
<p>The jury deliberated for two days. Jane Doe and her family members gathered in one of the school’s empty classrooms, waiting to hear the verdict on a television broadcasting from the room. At the word “guilty,” her jaw dropped. She sat in disbelief. Her mother, who had taken time off from her job as a grocery store cashier to be with her daughter, felt a rush of pride. Everyone had underestimated her daughter, she thought&mdash;“that tiny scrap of a thing.”</p>
<p>In the parking lot, Muise, the police officer who had picked Jane up that cold January night more than six years earlier, sat in her Jeep. Tears streamed down her face when she saw the verdict on Twitter (now X). She had hoped to catch Jane Doe’s eye when she left the building, but instead, she spotted Snelgrove being escorted in handcuffs.</p>
<p>Outside, supporters cheered and hugged. Cars and trucks blew past, honking in support. Across St. John’s, a dozen billboards flashed the words “Support for Jane Doe.” In the small fishing town where Jane grew up, members of a women’s dart tournament held a moment of silence.</p>
<p>In November 2021, Snelgrove was sentenced to four years in prison. He shook his head as the judge declared him a federal sex offender and stood as a sheriff clinked handcuffs on his wrists behind his back. He faced a row of mostly female supporters, who included his wife. She wore a pink sweater, her hair in a bun, and put her fingers to her mask, as if to blow him a kiss.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="smallcaps">ynn Moore</span>, a litigation lawyer who had given Jane Doe advice in the early days of the police investigation, wrestled with what to do. After Snelgrove’s conviction, a credible source provided details suggesting that the culture of sexual misconduct within the RNC ran deeper than anyone suspected. On July 19, 2021, Moore turned to Twitter and asked for information about other assaults by on-duty police officers. Her phone blew up. She fielded dozens of calls from women with stories disturbingly similar to Jane Doe’s. Moore, who is married to a retired police officer, was apoplectic. “When you’re on duty as a police officer, you’re supposed to be upholding the law, not violating it, not violating people,” she told me. “It’s just such an abuse of power.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada decision about Jane Doe’s case&mdash;namely, that Snelgrove at the wheel of a marked police car and wearing a uniform was enough of a potential inducement&mdash;led to a clearer, more nuanced understanding of consent law, providing better protection for victims of sex crimes. Almost a year after her tweet, Moore represented eight women who filed two separate civil suits in Newfoundland and Labrador’s Supreme Court. They allege that the province, the employer of the RNC, knew or ought to have known that police officers were preying on women and took no steps to stop them. </p>
<p>One of Moore’s clients is an RNC officer. Her lawsuit alleges she was out drinking downtown in June 2014 when an on-duty sergeant gave her a ride home in his police car. He invited himself in for a beer and raped her. The second lawsuit details allegations, from seven other women, of sexual assaults by police officers, spanning more than a decade and a half. They say they were picked up in police cars and forced into unwanted sexual acts. One incident from around 2014 was similar to the Snelgrove case. A drunk woman left a downtown bar and was driven home by an RNC officer. According to court documents, he helped her get into her home as she had lost her keys. Once inside, he raped her. (When asked for comment on the pending lawsuits, an RNC spokesperson said that the department “does not comment on matters before the court or those anticipated to be before the court.”)</p>
<p>The RNC quietly changed its rules about transporting the public in patrol vehicles, according to a Canadian Press story from September 2021. Officers are now allowed to drive civilians only as part of a call for service. The next summer, a civilian-led police oversight agency found a “disturbing pattern” of police officers using their position “to solicit sexual favour from women in the St. John’s area.” The agency determined that several incidents deserved a more thorough investigation, including one reported in 2017 in which a police officer drove a woman home from downtown, put his tongue in her mouth, and tried to put his hand up her skirt. The RNC allowed the officer to resign with no further action. </p>
<p>The impact of Jane Doe’s case on the RNC went further. An independent workplace review, published in 2022, found a significant number of police officers&mdash;as many as 45 percent&mdash;did not believe their workplace was free of offensive, degrading, and humiliating behaviour. One of the review’s recommendations was to create an office for police personnel to bring allegations of misconduct.  </p>
<p>For Jane Doe, the realization that her case encouraged other sexual assault victims to come forward was staggering. “If I hadn’t spoken up, none of these people likely would’ve either,” she told me at her kitchen table in rural Newfoundland. “I still can’t believe it.”</p>
<p>What she really wants is to start her life again. To go on vacation without worrying about being called back to court. To start a family with her partner. To move into a new house. And to tell her scared younger self that she’s going to be okay, that it’s finally all over. (As of this writing, Snelgrove has petitioned the Supreme Court of Canada to overturn his guilty verdict.)</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="smallcaps">ive months</span> after picking up Jane Doe and reporting her case, Muise was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. During the years the case wound through court, she struggled. She felt targeted as officers showed up in court to support Snelgrove. She felt they looked down on her for “selling out” one of their own. Eventually, it became too much, and she took stress leave. She recalled one occasion when Snelgrove approached her outside the courtroom. He wasn’t mad at her, he said, and leaned forward to give her a hug. Disgusted, Muise walked away.</p>
<p>Muise thought of Jane Doe often but held back from contacting her throughout the trials. Ahead of the sentencing, Jane Doe texted Muise a copy of her victim impact statement. In the four-page document, Jane Doe described how she took medication for anxiety and depression. How she felt suicidal. How she had become scared of people in positions of power. How she felt like she had lost control of her life and her body. How she still woke up from nightmares and experienced flashbacks of Snelgrove standing over her. And how she credited Muise with saving her life. “Thanks to grace, higher powers and reasons unknown to me,” Jane Doe wrote, “Constable [Muise] was driving that night. She changed my life by believing in me.”</p>
<p>Looking back, after years of therapy, Muise sees that Jane’s case is part of her own story. “It changed so much in my life,” said Muise, who spoke to me last October on an overcast afternoon in St. John’s. Recently retired after nineteen years in service, she finally felt free to speak.</p>
<p>In a baseball cap and facing the front door of the cafe so she could see who walked in, Muise, then thirty-nine, described how, when she was twenty-one&mdash;the same age Jane Doe was at the time of her assault&mdash;she was out drinking downtown and was offered a ride home by a cop in his patrol car. She was drunk when the officer made unwanted sexual advances and inappropriately touched her while parked outside her home. She described another time when she was twenty-nine. Again, she was out drinking with friends downtown, and a sergeant offered her a ride home. When they got to her place, he invited himself in to use the bathroom and groped her.</p>
<p>Muise said she didn’t report the assaults because, at the time, it seemed normal&mdash;just another instance of crude behaviour she was expected to tolerate on the job as a female police officer. Plus, she said, echoing Jane, “Who’s going to believe a drunk person over a sober police officer?” </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/how-a-sexual-assault-case-in-st-johns-exposed-a-police-forces-predatory-culture/">How a Sexual Assault Case in St. John’s Exposed a Police Force’s Predatory Culture</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

You&#8217;ll find the rest of our selections <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/20th-anniversary/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p><em>In 2017, it felt like the whole country was swept up in the rah-rah celebrations around Canada 150. It was a collective anniversary, a chance to celebrate our history. Well, some of it, anyway. Tied to the many calls to explore the country and take stock of its many wonders, Parks Canada released its Discovery Pass, which granted free entry to all national parks that year. These natural spaces “represent the very best that Canada has to offer,” it announced in a press release. “They are the essence of our country because they tell stories of who we are, including the history, cultures and contributions of Indigenous peoples.” But, as Robert Jago explored in his timely essay, Canada’s parks program was built on the displacement of Indigenous peoples and the capture of their territories&mdash;a form of “green colonialism.” Parks are wonderful spaces, but they have also acted as political cover for the control of land, a tactic we still see used today.&mdash;Daniel Viola, senior editor, November 2023 issue </em></p>
<p><span class="dropcap">V</span><span class="smallcaps">ancouver’s Stanley Park</span>&mdash;a place known for its dense forests and primeval atmosphere&mdash;was, as recently as 150 years ago, home to Squamish villages. People lived there for thousands of years. On the eastern edge of the park, facing downtown, there is a little island known to the Squamish as skwtsa7s. Salish oral histories record that the island was the site of a siege, one that ended with a sacrifice described here by <em>Legends of Vancouver</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Out before a long file of southern warriors they stood. Their chins uplifted, their eyes defiant, their breasts bared. Each leaned forward and laid his weapons at his feet, then stood erect, with empty hands, and laughed forth his challenge to death. A thousand arrows ripped the air, two hundred gallant northern throats flung forth a death cry exultant, triumphant as conquering kings&mdash;then two hundred fearless northern hearts ceased to beat.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Canadians have always thought of their country as an archipelago of cities in a sea of untouched wilderness. We see this idealized version of the country in everything from paintings by the Group of Seven to the works of Farley Mowat. It’s also a concept that the government likes to promote: forests, mountains, and lakes all featured regularly in Canada’s 150th anniversary promotions. Parks Canada also released its much-celebrated Discovery Pass, which granted free access to national parks for the year.</p>
<p>Many Canadians see the collective possession and exploration of this wilderness as a right of citizenship. But the pristine landscapes seen in government promotions&mdash;and the very concept of Canada as a wilderness&mdash;are unrecognizable to me and to other Indigenous people. In addition to being the sesquicentennial, 2017 was also designated as a year for reconciliation with First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples. As an ongoing part of this reconciliation, the government acknowledges the traumas of the residential school system. But it still celebrates other crimes&mdash;specifically, a parks system that has robbed and impoverished Indigenous peoples.</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century, some of our land was taken for farming; in the twentieth century, still more was appropriated for public works and military use. And all throughout these years, continuing to this day, thefts have been occurring under the guise of ecological preservation&mdash;green colonialism.</p>
<p>Many in Canada dismiss Indigenous peoples’ connection to the land as romantic and irrational. They say that we should abandon it to move closer to the urban areas for our own good. In a piece for <em>Maclean’s</em>, journalist Scott Gilmore wrote that First Nations must “leave these [remote reserves], forever” or, pending that, be sent “a backhoe as they keep digging graves.” Former prime minister Jean Chrétien has made similar statements. Indigenous people who don’t want to leave their land are simply “nostalgic about the past when they were going hunting and fishing,” he said in 2016. Even Jonathan Kay, a former editor-in-chief of this magazine, once stated that the abandonment of our homelands was the only way for Indigenous people to “make a living and exist in dignity.”</p>
<p>But the desire for the return of these lands goes beyond nostalgia. The places Canada has made into parks are filled with our stories&mdash;every mountain, every valley has a name and a history for Indigenous peoples. It is in these places that our history is alive: our Mecca is here, our Magna Carta, our Thermopylae.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="smallcaps">anada&#8217;s</span> parks departments have treated Indigenous peoples like an infestation ever since the founding, in 1885, of what is now Banff National Park. Looking out at the territories under his supervision, superintendent George Stewart demanded that “Indians” be barred from the area. “Their destruction of the game and depredations among the ornamental trees,” he wrote, “make their too frequent visits to the Park a matter of great concern.” In the early twentieth century, as non-native settlements such as Banff and Jasper grew, the livelihoods of First Nations peoples were destroyed.</p>
<p>This tactic soon became standard practice on other “protected” lands. In Algonquin Park, Algonquin people were denied title and recognition for their towns of Lawrence and Nightingale, which lay within the park’s boundaries. In 1895, Aubrey White, Ontario’s assistant commissioner of Crown lands, wrote of the presence of Algonquin people in language that we now reserve for the Asian pine beetle: “You know the predatory habits of these people, how they roam about, and how difficult it is to keep watch of their movements in the forest.” The Algonquin people were eventually forced out into distant reserves.</p>
<p>At a 2000 hearing before Canada’s heritage committee, James Plewak of the Keeseekoowenin Ojibway First Nation discussed the founding of Manitoba’s Riding Mountain National Park in the 1930s. “Our people were burned out of their homes,” he said. “Indians and parks were considered not to be compatible.”</p>
<p>Such actions are not relegated to the past. The government set a goal to designate 17 percent of Canada as protected space by 2020. To this date, protected areas are still being created without Indigenous consent. In 2016, Surrey Bend Regional Park was established in British Columbia within the territories of the Katzie and Kwantlen First Nations&mdash;land that is currently under negotiation as part of the Katzie treaty process. As Tumia Knott, councillor for the Kwantlen First Nation, says, “We’ve noticed that where these parks have been situated is rather strategic&mdash;they’re places of real significance and importance to Kwantlen.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">s Indigneous peoples</span> rebuild, we are striving to reconnect with our lost territories. This means reclaiming parks whenever possible and asserting stewardship and economic rights when we can’t get the land itself back. The modern fight to reclaim land began with the 1974 Ojibway occupation of Anicinabe Park in Kenora, Ontario. Since then, some battles have involved guns&mdash;during the Ipperwash Crisis in 1995, for example, unarmed First Nations activist Dudley George was killed by out-of-control police. Other fights have taken place in the courts&mdash;the landmark 1999 <em>R v. Sundown</em> decision, for instance, recognized First Nations’ traditional rights to establish hunting infrastructure in parks exempt from provincial regulation. Around the negotiating table, Indigenous peoples have worked to prevent the unilateral creation or expansion of parks at Pukaskwa, Point Pelee, Wager Bay, and Great Slave Lake by government.</p>
<p>In Vancouver, the Musqueam people have reclaimed portions of Pacific Spirit Regional Park and the surrounding area, near the University of British Columbia campus and on the western edge of Vancouver. Understandably, the Musqueam have done what anyone would do to a parcel of west-side Vancouver: they cut down some trees and plan to put up condos. Just like James Plewak said in reference to Riding Mountain National Park, these lands are “the most important resources we [have] to sustain our lives.”</p>
<p>The construction plans produced a litany of irony-immune quotes from local residents: “Once you’ve allowed a little bit of the park to be removed, no park in the whole province is going to be safe anymore”; “We don’t think it’s right that the government should take [land] and give it away”; “Are we going to go giving away parks like Stanley Park?” For centuries, First Nations have seen our land taken from us one piece at a time. It’s galling to see our words turned against us as we take our lands back.</p>
<p>Not every repatriation ends with two-bedroom condos. Some result in First Nations creating parks of our own. The Tŝilhqot’in Nation in BC turned much of its newly recovered lands into the Dasiqox Tribal Park. Elsewhere in the province, the Doig River First Nation has been struggling to establish the K’ih Tsaa?dze Tribal Park.</p>
<p>But these are not typical parks where nature is protected from human use. In an interview with the DeSmogBlog, Jack Woodward, a lawyer for the Tŝilhqot’in First Nation, explained that tribal parks are created to defend the “sustainability of the ecosystems necessary to support the aboriginal or treaty rights.” He explained that “a tribal park recognizes the fact that you can still live on the land, and make a living from the land.”</p>
<p>Such approaches face predictable non-native resistance. In Osoyoos, BC, a local newspaper published remarks from petitioners who were upset about First Nations involvement in a new park. The words of one stand out: “The ridiculous allowance that hunting is their right anytime any place will be the extinction of our wildlife.” Comments such as that are virtually identical to those spouted by the superintendent of Canada’s first park and show that far too little has changed in the past 150 years.</p>
<p>Canadians advocating for more protected spaces need to understand their own history. A major part of reconciliation is accepting that when we celebrate Canada 200, Algonquin people may again be living in Algonquin Park, and that Stanley Park and the turquoise waters of Moraine Lake in Banff National Park may be dotted with First Nations homes and businesses. Wilderness may be a sacred concept to Canadians, but it’s one that must be sacrificed if reconciliation is to have meaning. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/canadas-national-parks-are-colonial-crime-scenes/">Canada’s National Parks Are Colonial Crime Scenes</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>
