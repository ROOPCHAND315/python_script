<p>COP27 recognized that the three existential crises—climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss—are interconnected and can only be solved together.</p>
<p>Working hand in hand on solutions to protect biodiversity and tackle climate change is a critical priority for the planet. How can we connect these issues in ways that inspire action?</p>
<p>Join the <b>German Embassy and Consulates in Canada</b> and <b>The Walrus</b> for a timely online discussion about the lessons and challenges at the intersection of biodiversity and climate-focused communication in Canada and Europe. Almost one year after the 2022 UN Biodiversity Conference in Montreal, as world leaders prepare to meet at the 2023 UN Climate Change Conference, our distinguished panel of environmental journalists and climate advocates gathers to discuss how innovative journalism and biodiversity-focused communication can break down silos and bridge divides, as well as to share transatlantic perspectives on actions, facts, and policy.</p>

Growing up in Whitehorse, I remember having the perfect childhood: bicycling in our backyard, catching frogs, hanging out with my sisters, and just doing all of these wonderful kid things.</p>
<p>I was the son of a well-spoken and well-regarded Gwich’in woman. My mom was the youngest of thirteen kids. Before she was born, my grandparents had left our community of Old Crow, Yukon&mdash;my grandmother to become a cook at a residential school, my grandfather to become a janitor&mdash;so they could be with their kids.</p>
<!-- Widget Shortcode --><div id="custom_html-47" class="widget_text widget widget_custom_html widget-shortcode area-arbitrary "><div class="textwidget custom-html-widget"><div class='_form_1'></div><script type='text/javascript' src='https://thewalrus.activehosted.com/f/embed.php?static=0&id=1&6557B058F37E4&nostyles=1&preview=0'></script></div></div><!-- /Widget Shortcode -->
<p>I remember falling asleep under meeting tables as a young child, when my mom was the executive assistant to the grand chief of the Council of Yukon First Nations. During that time, our people were negotiating with the federal and territorial governments toward what is known as the Umbrella Final Agreement, a document that set the parameters for self-governing First Nations in the territory.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thewalrus.ca/who-we-are-now/"><img style="width: 100%;" src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/20th-banner-in-article-horizontal.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>At eight years old, I came home one day to find my dad was gone. A deep schism formed in my mom—between that accomplished woman and the pains she was carrying from her experiences in residential school. She became severely addicted to alcohol. At thirteen, I ran away from home. I had started smoking weed and drinking. I sold stolen cigarettes to buy food.</p>
<p>Somewhere around my thirteenth birthday, I received a video camera. I started taking it to parties and filming everything we did. The RCMP heard rumours about this kid with the video camera&mdash;just imagine all of the evidence I could have provided them. When I heard they were looking for me, I knew I had to get out of Whitehorse. I convinced my mom to pay for a flight to Vancouver, where I could stay with my auntie. At one point, I thought to myself, “No one here knows who I am. I can be anybody I want.” That was the first time I asked myself, “Who do I want to be?”</p>
<p>It took a while to shake off the drugs and emerge from my depression. Things finally started to change a few years later, when I got a job at a gelato shop. I quit smoking so I could better train my palate to distinguish flavours. I was living in a beautiful bungalow. I had my vintage leather jacket and my skinny jeans and my $50 haircut, but I wasn’t connected to anything.</p>
<p>In January 2013, I got off the plane in Old Crow. I learned hunting, trapping, and fishing. I learned how to chop wood and make a proper fire. I soaked it all up. Surrounded by these skies, these sunsets, these northern lights, these mountains—you’re alone in the vast openness. The whole world reveals itself to you. It’s like the awe you feel in a European cathedral but in a living way. </p>
<p>In 2015, I helped found the Youth of the Peel, a nonprofit that aimed to protect the Peel River watershed from development. In 2018, when I was thirty-two, I was elected chief of the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation.</p>
<p>As chief, I made climate change a focus. I passed an emergency declaration and pledged to take our community to net zero by 2050. We were fully dependent on imported diesel for electricity. Through the Old Crow Solar Project, we’re moving toward energy sovereignty and reducing our reliance on diesel.</p>
<p>Climate change didn’t start with the industrial revolution. It began with the imbalanced worldview of the dominant culture. The founding legal document of Canada is not the British North America Act; it’s the Great Wampum belt of the seventeenth century, which shows two lines representing canoes moving in parallel. It was said that no one canoe should be fuller than the other. We have deviated from that. If Canadians want to do something about climate change, they can support their agreements with Indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>Our teachings don’t belong to just us. They are the birthrights of all of us, including the non-Indigenous partner who has forgotten them. The walls that separate us may be made out of stone. But we can deconstruct those walls and use those stones to build a bridge.</p>

Authored by an association of professional spies with a name befitting an indie rock band—the Strategic Futures Group—the report is written to encourage the White House and its advisors to stretch their thinking toward a longer time horizon.</p>
<p>The 2021 edition of <em>Global Trends</em>, titled &#8220;A More Contested World,&#8221; focuses on the intersecting challenges facing humanity amid conditions of “expanding uncertainty.” One of the report’s main graphics features a box labelled “Eroding Human Security” surrounded by an array of menacing inputs or “drivers”: extreme weather, water misuse, sea-level rise, geoengineering, societal and government change, unequal burdens, instability, conflict, and more. Inside that besieged box, the report argues, is the future we will all inhabit unless a miracle occurs.</p>
<p>The report concludes by proffering five imagined scenarios, each envisioning a trajectory our uncertain future might take. The final speculative narrative envisions a global youth led environmental revolution that eventually leads to the establishment of a new international organization: the Human Security Council. Reading the final scenario, I found myself nodding in agreement with American intelligence officials for the first time in my life&mdash;a disconcerting experience in its own right. If we want to escape the little box labelled “Eroding Human Security,” a massive and visionary social movement will indeed have to shift our social systems away from the fossil-fuel-guzzling status quo.</p>
<p>At the same time, I wondered if a Human Security Council is really enough to set us on a stable course. If the challenges facing humanity are so enmeshed with a devastated planet, as the National Intelligence report makes clear they are, then shouldn’t we also be asking what security means for the ecosystems, plants, and animals on which our own food, health, and environmental security depend?</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smallcaps">hen the</span> National Intelligence Council described a future of expanding uncertainty and insecurity, the report authors knew these terms would be unsettling to most readers. But uncertainty and insecurity are not always bad. If we want to prevent the worst consequences of the economic and ecological collapse their report warns of&mdash;and avoid living in some of the more foreboding future scenarios it portends&mdash;there are many entrenched systems and ingrained habits of thinking that need to be made less certain and secure. Our world is becoming more unsettled in many troubling ways. In others, it is not nearly unsettled enough. </p>
<p>As the late Secwepemc leader and political strategist Arthur Manuel argues in his co-authored 2015 book <em>Unsettling Canada</em>, one thing that needs to be shaken up is the colonial claim to land itself. The recognition of Indigenous sovereignty would have profound implications for social justice and sustainability, for the economic insecurity of Indigenous peoples, and for ecological stability more broadly. </p>
<p>It has taken generations of organizing and resistance by <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/indigenous/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Indigenous</a> people to get Canada to begin to accept the existence of what is officially called “Aboriginal title,” Indigenous peoples’ inherent right to their traditional territories. In Manuel’s account, ensuring that Indigenous rights were included in the Constitution Act of 1982 was a critical victory in the ongoing fight to unsettle the government’s justification for Crown ownership of the vast majority of Canadian land. These justifications remain entangled with the incongruous sixteenth-century legal idea of terra nullius, which says that land people inhabited for tens of thousands of years was in fact empty and could be “discovered” by hungry and confused foreigners and magically made into a British possession.</p>

</ul>
<p>In a series of watershed legal decisions, the Canadian courts have slowly begun to chip away at this colonial absurdity, with <em>Delgamuukw v. British Columbia</em> marking a major turning point. In 1984, the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en Nations launched an unprecedented legal challenge to try to realize the Aboriginal rights recently enshrined by the new Constitution. They sued for recognition of their Aboriginal title to more than 133 individual hereditary territories totalling 58,000 square kilometres of land that had never been ceded in a treaty, a claim that forced the Canadian government to reckon with the legal reality of the Indigenous commons and concepts of sovereignty, ownership, and property.</p>
<p>As oral cultures, the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en Nations did not document land ownership through written contracts and deeds, and the plaintiffs set a precedent by using oral traditions, rather than written documentation, as legal proof. They affirmed their possession of the land through the Gitxsan adaawk and Wet’suwet’en kungax, verbal collections of legends, laws, rituals, and traditions Elders presented as evidence, much to the judge’s consternation. On the first day of testimony, the hereditary chiefs made statements explaining how their respective nations approached the issue of property law. Gitxsan Chief Delgamuukw Earl Muldoe, the case’s named plaintiff, set the tone. “My power is carried in my House’s histories, songs, dances, and crests,” Delgamuukw said. “For us, the ownership of territory is a marriage of the Chief and the land. Each Chief has an ancestor who encountered and acknowledged the life and the land. From such encounters come power. The land, the plants, the animals, and the people all have spirit&mdash;they all must be shown respect. That is the basis of our law.” One of the Elders invited to testify was Mary Johnson, who was asked to sing a song documenting territorial proprietorship&mdash;a dirge about two young girls saved from starvation by a bird after their brother has died. The judge objected. “To have witnesses singing songs in court is not the proper way to approach this problem,” he said. Besides, he had a “tin ear,” one incapable of hearing what a mournful song had to do with a specific place or history. How could property be secured by words that were sung?</p>
<p>Following 318 days of evidence and fifty-six days of closing arguments, the judge delivered his verdict. Citing John Locke’s intellectual precursor, the seventeenth-century philosopher Thomas Hobbes, the decision described life for the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en peoples before colonization as “nasty, brutish, and short” and ruled against the plaintiffs. But when the Supreme Court of Canada heard the case on appeal a decade later, the justices were more inclined to listen. In 1997, the Supreme Court recognized the principle of Aboriginal title as a form of collective ownership, even as it declined to rule on the specific land and title in question, advising the federal government to negotiate directly with First Nations and find a way to reconcile Aboriginal and Crown claims, which the government has so far refused to do. In the words of Toronto Metropolitan University professor Shiri Pasternak, “The Supreme Court agreed that Indigenous peoples held a unique property right to their land. It was a collective interest held by a nation” and by both present and future generations. By affirming the validity of oral testimony, the decision was also an important step toward bridging Indigenous and Canadian legal traditions and making what is called common law more common, which is to say more pluralistic and shared. </p>
<p>The verdict caused the private sector to panic. Government documents Pasternak obtained through a Freedom of Information request show lobbyists grasping for “certainty,” by which they meant uncontested access to Indigenous property. The day after the ruling, Marlie Beets, then the vice-president of the BC Council of Forest Industries, complained that <em>Delgamuukw</em> “has only created more uncertainty and we are very concerned by how governments will react to the court’s findings. . . .  The decision makes the need for certainty through surrender all the more clear.” In emails and faxes, corporate lobbyists urged government officials to push First Nations to surrender their newly expanded rights to ensure the “certainty” of commercial interests. The director of the BC Cattlemen’s Association vowed to put “great pressure on the provincial government to commit to a cede, release and surrender approach.” A “certainty working group” meeting was arranged by the BC Treaty Negotiations advisory committee lawyer, who counselled that a treaty process should seek “an end of Aboriginal rights and title”&mdash;an approach the United Nations has strongly opposed.</p>
<p>Despite the Canadian Supreme Court’s recognition of Aboriginal title and the support of international human rights law, the fight for Indigenous sovereignty remains profoundly lopsided, with impoverished communities going up against multinational behemoths, their powerful provincial lobbyists, and the government agencies that abet them. Over the years, various Supreme Court decisions have further bolstered Indigenous claims, but the Crown continues to grant private companies permission to drill, mine, log, and dam on unceded land. This includes approval of the controversial 670-kilometre Coastal GasLink Pipeline that would traffic fracked gas along what Pasternak has described as a “coveted energy corridor” that runs through traditional Wet’suwet’en territory. Powered by the fantasy of the colonial commons, Chevron, TransCanada, and Enbridge are all determined to build fossil fuel economy infrastructure on Wet’suwet’en land despite community opposition and an outpouring of global solidarity. When the hereditary leadership who brought forward the <em>Delgamuukw</em> case asserted their jurisdiction by defending unceded territory with peaceful blockades, the government sent the police to remove protesters from their own land at gunpoint. The RCMP’s violent response revealed how threatening Aboriginal title is to the petroleum industry and the risk it poses to the security of their profits. </p>
<p>In <em>Unsettling Canada</em>, Manuel reminds us that the <em>Delgamuukw</em> decision not only confirmed and expanded Aboriginal rights but also affirmed the corresponding duties that come with them. The right to take from the earth is inseparable from the responsibility to also take care of and replenish it. The Supreme Court ruled that the only situation in which Aboriginal title must be extinguished involves communities engaging in activities that destroy their land or are inconsistent with their connection to the land, thereby depriving future generations of its benefit (Manuel gives the example of building a parking lot on a sacred site). This condition, as Manuel explains, further obligates Indigenous peoples to protect their territories from irresponsible and unsustainable development&mdash;the kind of development the private sector wants a certain and secure right to pursue. Here we have an example of just the kind of unsettling that our insecure age requires: the unsettling of a system of ownership that tramples on people’s constitutional rights while injuring the planet. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n 1974</span>, ecologist Garrett Hardin published an article in <em>Psychology Today</em> in which he scoffed at the idea of returning land or making reparations to Indigenous communities, building on the arguments he put forth in his 1968 essay “The Tragedy of the Commons.” Titled “Lifeboat Ethics: The Case against Helping the Poor,” it once again invited the reader to picture a scene, this time an ocean instead of an open field. Small vessels full of wealthy passengers float perilously in a sea of drowning people who threaten to capsize the ships. The only way for the privileged few to protect themselves, Hardin argues, is to keep others out&mdash;out of the lifeboats, out of the rich countries, out of the commons&mdash;by hoarding resources, halting immigration, and ending international food aid in order to reduce the global population of the poor, who he acknowledges are overwhelmingly non-white. “For the foreseeable future,” he writes, “our survival demands that we govern our actions by the ethics of a lifeboat, harsh though they may be.” Hardin’s ideas align with the current of thinking now called “eco-fascist,” one on the rise in our uncertain times. It is based on the narrowest and meanest concept of security, of guarding one’s privilege at the expense of others’ lives. This is a vision, as one toxic and terrifying white supremacist slogan states, of “green futures for white babies.” </p>
<p>Of course, there are the denialists too. Rejecting the reality of climate change, they consider social change to be the true security threat&mdash;a threat to industry profits, consumer lifestyles, and established racial and gender hierarchies. Sociologist Cara Daggett has coined the term “petro-masculinity” to describe the way climate denial, gas-guzzling trucks, and slabs of red meat have become potent symbols of patriarchal virtue (hence the slur “soy boy,” lobbed at men who are seen as soft or, worse, vegetarian). In this paradigm, contempt for the more-than-human world, and for anyone who tries to care for it, reinforces contempt for certain categories of people&mdash;anyone who is not white, male, and able bodied. Research by Queen’s University political theorist Will Kymlicka found that faith in species hierarchy is “consistently associated with greater dehumanization of disadvantaged or marginalized human groups.” Or as the celebrated abolitionist Angela Davis recently told me, “The prioritizing of humans also leads to restrictive definitions of who counts as human, and the brutalization of animals is related to the brutalization of human animals.” </p>
<p>The scramble to subjugate other people and creatures has yielded a pyrrhic victory of mega fires, heat domes, polar vortexes, super storms, and droughts. Five hundred years after the philosopher Thomas More wrote about the plague of sheep set loose on the English commons, livestock have devoured the earth. Domesticated and commodified animals, mainly cows and pigs, now make up more than 62 percent of all mammalian biomass, deforesting wide swaths of land and emitting huge amounts of carbon, while all wild animals have been reduced to a paltry 4 percent. The wilderness that remains is largely protected by Indigenous peoples, who make up around 5 percent of the world’s population and protect 80 percent of global biodiversity. Proposals like those seeking to establish more Marine Protected Areas in partnership with First Nations on Canada’s west coast are a promising sign of a growing recognition that environmental caretaking and repair need investment and support. But ultimately, planetary stewardship is something everyone should be responsible for.</p>
<p>My interest in rights for nature stems, in part, from my conviction that biodiversity has political as well as biological value. Each species we extinguish diminishes what we might call ecological democracy, underscoring the need to devise a political system that can effectively represent and protect the interests of other life forms. The benefit to animals and insects, as well as the 40 percent of plant species now imperilled by climate change, should be more than enough to jolt us into fighting extinction. But we should also cultivate solidarity with the more-than-human world out of crass self-interest. Biodiversity is essential to our existence: to the security of the ecosystems we are embedded in, the food systems we rely on, and our ability to avoid future pandemics. When an ecosystem is healthy, biodiversity buffers the transmission of deadly pathogens; genetic variation dilutes and disrupts pathways of contagion. This means that the same shrinking and fragmenting of wild habitat that decreases biodiversity also increases opportunities for what scientists call “spillover,” or human–animal contact and cross-species infection, the dynamic that likely led to recent Ebola outbreaks in Guinea.</p>
<p>As a 2020 United Nations report on pandemic prevention explains, infectious diseases typically emerge as the result of human activity. They are yet another insecurity-producing symptom of human hubris, an outgrowth of long-standing attempts to conquer nature. Land-use changes, above all the clearing of land for intensive animal agriculture, are responsible for one-third of all emerging diseases. Like the hurricanes and droughts that result from a warming climate, novel and dangerous pathogens are connected to human activity, though not in the straightforwardly conspiratorial way some people like to imagine. The 1918 influenza, for example, likely began as a bird or swine flu on an industrial farm. Conditions are even more congenial to harmful microbes on modern feed lots, which crowd huge numbers of genetically similar animals together in cruel and unsanitary conditions. In the US and Canada, livestock are dosed with 80 percent of all the medically important antibiotics the countries consume&mdash;a recipe for breeding drug-resistant superbugs. As one medical journal recently put it, intensive animal agriculture gives viruses countless “spins at pandemic roulette.” The American Public Health Association, the largest organization of public health professionals in the US, has repeatedly called for a moratorium on factory farming for this reason. </p>
<p>Given these and countless other challenges, we can’t limit our ambitions to the Human Security Council that the National Intelligence Council report envisioned, though that would be an excellent start. Only More-Than-Human Security will suffice. We must work with the natural world rather than against it, co-operating with the sun and wind to harness renewable energy, with the oceans and forests to sequester carbon without choking and acidifying them, with biodiverse plants to cool our cities and feed the world, with animal allies like the water-protecting and firefighting beavers who provide refuge for other species. Yet despite the consensus from the United Nations and leading scientists and physicians that our future security requires paying attention to the interconnections between human, animal, and ecosystem well-being, a human-centric and profit-hungry attitude still dominates. Instead of recognizing biodiversity as an essential component of biosecurity, Canada and the US have recently passed laws that paint environmentalists and animal rights activists as urgent security threats.</p>
<p>In addition to working with nature, we also, of course, need to work with each other. This requires turning our climate anxiety and insecurity into solidarity&mdash;solidarity that is strong enough to respond to rising authoritarianism and to overcome the special interests championing the inadequate business-as-usual solutions that make up the standard menu of government climate policies today.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">s the scientists behind</span> the 2022 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report and the spies of the National Intelligence Council have made abundantly clear, everything must change: our energy systems, our food systems, our transportation systems, and our welfare systems. Activist and author <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-rising-tide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Naomi Klein has argued</a> that ensuring a baseline of material security for people, especially a green jobs guarantee that could facilitate a just transition away from fossil fuels, is a critical part of coping with climate disruption. As she puts it, “the more secure people feel, knowing that their families will not want for food, medicine, and shelter, the less vulnerable they will be to the forces of racist demagoguery that will prey on the fears that invariably accompany times of great change.” Material security, she argues, can help us “address the crisis of empathy in a warming world.” </p>
<p>The income supports provided by the US and Canadian governments in response to the <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> pandemic were highly effective, improving material security in ways that hadn’t been seen since the welfare state’s creation in the wake of World War II. But as Klein and others rightly insist, we cannot simply revive the social policies of the New Deal or COVID eras. Instead of looking back nostalgically to the twentieth-century welfare state, which was predicated on assumptions of limitless economic growth and ecological extraction and marred by racialized and gendered exclusions, we should aspire to a forward-looking vision of a state that provides security for all in a way that is sustainable, a state that is both decarbonized and democratic&mdash;what I like to call a solidarity state. Rooted in the collaborative ethos of the commons, a solidarity state aspires to both political and economic equality and a recognition of our fundamental interdependence, including our interdependence with the more-than-human world. </p>
<p>As Anishinaabe linguist and lawyer Lindsay Borrows has said, nature needs rights, but humans need a “bill of obligations.” Above all, we need the obligation not to take anything from nature unless we also take care to replenish it, so that we honour ecological limits. We now know where ignoring obligations and limits gets us: climate calamity and spiralling insecurity. But this is hardly a revelation. In the dialogue <em>Critias</em>, Plato laments land destroyed by mismanagement, describing the barren soil, absence of trees, and abandoned shrines where fresh springs used to be as “the skeleton of a sick man, all the fat and soft earth having wasted away.” The Sumerians, Romans, Mayans, and other ancient societies pushed past ecological limits, spawning instability and hastening civilizational collapse. To read accounts of the colonial era is to encounter settlers marvelling at their own destructive impact on the environment and sometimes planning the devastation outright. The difference today is that this destruction is now happening on a global scale. </p>
<p>Anthropocentric attempts to conquer the earth are always self-defeating. There is no way to conquer the world if we want to securely exist within it. We’ll never be the confident all-powerful alpha wolves of the animal kingdom that petro-masculinists want us to be&mdash;which is fitting, because the idea of alpha wolves is a misconception that came from studying animals in captivity. In the wild, there are no wolf hierarchies that the animals fight to climb.</p>
<p>The image of the natural world as an inclusive circle instead of an exclusive hierarchy is not rose-coloured romanticism; it is a more accurate reflection of the science that describes our reality, where we are embedded in an elaborate sustaining circle of life, non-life, and even semi-life. My father is a medicinal chemist whose research focuses on viruses, including the one that causes COVID-19. Viruses are microscopic sequences of DNA or RNA reliant on hijacking the energy of host cells to replicate; they inhabit a category-defying limbo, a strange grey zone between living and non-living, animate and not. What I see in my father’s work is less a drive for mastery than a sense of mystery. Viruses are hardly lovable, but my father has shown me they deserve our respect, even awe. The fact that our lives depend on biological and physical processes we can barely categorize, and complex dynamics we certainly do not command, should occasion wonder&mdash;and a large dose of humility. This humility is the ethos I associate with the good and generative capacities of insecurity, the kind that can help us be curious, connect, evolve, and maybe survive in a radically changing world. </p>
<p>I don’t have a blueprint for a society in which all of our problems are forever solved&mdash;no one does. I don’t believe in utopia, but I can imagine a more hopeful future where our problems get more interesting and complex&mdash;a complexity befitting the tangled and unpredictable world we live in. Instead of the dull and demoralizing questions we are faced with today&mdash;Should a handful of fossil fuel executives have licence to incinerate the planet?&mdash;we could aim to build a secure and sustainable society that will force us to grapple with far more compelling philosophical and practical riddles. If nature has rights, should invasive species have equal protections? Where does a watershed end if all ecosystems are interconnected? How can we make decisions and exercise sovereignty when our actions have global repercussions? How can we ensure freedom and dignity for everyone while respecting ecological limits? These are the sorts of questions worth pondering, and the answers are not readily apparent. But for all that is uncertain and unsettled, there is one thing I know for sure: the illusion of human security at nature’s expense cannot hold. </p>

As the noontime rally got underway, local musician Allan Rankin’s tune “The Disappearing Island” piped in over a portable speaker. A group of Island women called the O Beautiful Gaia singers, committed to protecting the environment, joined their voices in harmony. The demonstrators were calling for an immediate moratorium on a controversial cottage development in an area called Point Deroche. “Talk with us,” event emcee James Rodd said, inviting the premier.  </p>
<p>In September 2020, the PEI cabinet approved the sale of an oceanfront property of 17.5 acres to 251 Kelpie Lane Inc., later identified as a company owned by Jesse and Julia Rasch, a couple from Ontario. A clause in the province’s Lands Protection Act prohibits non-Island residents from owning more than five acres of land, but the cabinet can overrule the clause, which they did in this case. Soon, a massive summer home, comprised of four separate buildings, was approved for development on the site, located along one of the Island’s most iconic beaches. Locals say the development is an eyesore and imperils access to the beach at high tide. The situation has rankled scores of Islanders. For many of them, their history and identity have been shaped by contested land ownership, the meddling influence of outsiders, and a sacrosanct belief in their right to roam the Island’s beaches unimpeded. </p>
<p>In some ways, the protest was about much more than one cottage. PEI welcomes over 1.3 million visitors each year&mdash;about seven times the province’s population&mdash;and is home to a large number of seasonal residents from other parts of Canada and from the United States, many lured by the relatively inexpensive oceanfront properties. Scarce land, a booming population, and the existential threat posed by coastal erosion have exacerbated the locals’ mistrust of land ownership by perceived outsiders. The Point Deroche controversy is a harbinger of the land use conversations the province and the rest of the country need to sort out as climate change accelerates erosion and visibly blurs the line between public and private property.</p>

</ul>
<p>Last December, a group of concerned Island citizens called the Coalition for the Protection of PEI Land&mdash;on whose behalf Rodd was speaking&mdash;forwarded a petition signed by over 2,500 people to King, demanding an immediate stop-work order on the construction at Point Deroche. For several months, the coalition had been requesting a meeting with the government to air their concerns about Point Deroche and other land transactions. According to Rodd, this outreach&mdash;along with subsequent emails and phone calls&mdash;was ignored, leading directly to the June rally. “We are here to insist that the premier and government listen to the voice of the PEI community,” Rodd said, to enthusiastic applause. “Who speaks for the land?”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smallcaps">ased in Ontario</span>, the Rasch family runs a foundation investing in medical research, health education, and environmental stewardship. (The Raschs did not respond to a request for comment submitted through their website.) They’ve spent the past dozen years summering on the Island. The land they purchased on a relatively isolated stretch of the North Shore straddles a part of the province famous for white-sand beaches, vulnerable marshlands, and wild, windy weather. The former home on the property&mdash;known locally as the Old MacAndrew House&mdash;was a landmark for Island walkers, who travel the shoreline to walk their dogs or to beachcomb. The old property included remnants of a rudimentary and rotting seawall, built of creosote-treated timbers, constructed by previous owners in a fruitless attempt to stop erosion that has, by some measures, sucked nearly twenty metres of nearby land into the sea over the past forty years. </p>
<p>It didn’t take locals long to realize changes were afoot at the MacAndrew place. Trails advocate Bryson Guptill walks this beach frequently with his partner, Sue. Last summer, during a walk to Point Deroche, he and Sue noticed that the MacAndrew house was gone. In September 2022, during a subsequent visit, they came upon what appeared to be a giant pile of boulders dumped along the beach where the old seawall had stood. The rocks in fact marked the initial stages of an elaborate shoreline project undertaken by the Rasch family to protect or “armour” the ocean-facing property against erosion. At high tide, however, the rock pile blocked Bryson and Sue’s path across the beach, a fact later documented by <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.6671151" rel="noopener" target="_blank">images gathered</a> by the CBC. While the old seawall had also obstructed beach access, the higher elevation of the new rock protection made the armouring appear more extreme. On September 11 last year, Guptill&mdash;a former policy adviser with the provincial and federal governments&mdash;posted a photo of this new armouring in a popular Facebook group he organizes for Island hiking enthusiasts. </p>
<p>His post galvanized Island residents, setting off a chain of competing claims and government backtracking still being sorted out today. Islanders have expressed their contempt in public forums, across social media, and in comments submitted as part of the coalition’s petition to the provincial government, including one that described the development as “an egregious attack on the historical right for people to have free access to the shore on PEI.” The harshest vitriol seemed reserved for the notion that non-residents had scooped up a cherished part of the Island for their own use. “The beaches are owned by everyone, not seasonal residents,” one comment reads.</p>
<p>Controversies around waterfront access have become more common in Canada in recent years, from lakefront squabbles in Ontario’s resort country to legislative fights over coastal erosion in Nova Scotia. In PEI, however, one expert says, the visceral nature of unease underlines a deeper fear. Laurie Brinklow, chair of the University of Prince Edward Island’s Institute of Island Studies, sees the Point Deroche situation in existential terms. For Brinklow, the connection many Islanders feel to the coastline is central to their sense of psychological well-being. Living on a small island creates a feeling of boundedness among island dwellers, of being held by the place where water and land meet. The edge of the coastline is sacred space, she says, and blocking access to that space constitutes a kind of psychic disruption. “It really hits to the heart of people’s sense of islandness and identity.”</p>
<p>Brinklow points out that, on smaller islands, space is always a contested issue because there’s such a minimal amount of land. “The smaller the scraps, the scrappier the fight,” she says. The land question has long been a thorny issue on PEI, going back to the eighteenth century, when the first European settlers in what would become PEI were beholden to wealthy absentee landlords who, between them, owned the entire land mass of the island and whose negligence created almost feudal conditions among local farmers. Of course, the entirety of the land that now comprises PEI&mdash;called Epekwitk in Mi’kmaw&mdash;was never legally ceded by the Mi’kmaq in the first place. Negotiations are currently underway for a proposed agreement that would see Epekwitnewaq Mi’kmaq and Parks Canada work as partners to co-manage the natural heritage places administered by Parks Canada on PEI, including protected shoreline not far from Point Deroche. And while a recent report on land use commissioned by the PEI government recommends offering the Mi’kmaq a substantive role in the development and shaping of land policies and land management in the province moving forward, the current debate at Point Deroche seems to largely exclude a Mi’kmaq perspective. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">hree days</span> after Guptill’s post last September, provincial officials <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-point-deroche-stop-order-1.6797626." rel="noopener" target="_blank">issued a stop-work order</a>, according to reporting by the CBC. Construction was halted after officials inspected the site and concluded that the location of the proposed structures did not meet the requirements set out in the province’s Planning Act. Soon, however, construction had resumed. In a statement to CBC News early in the spring, the province said the cease-construction letter was rescinded after provincial staff met the developer on site and “it was revealed that the building was in compliance with the application, provincial legislation, and information submitted.” A Nova Scotia environmental law firm engaged by Guptill disagrees, stating in a legal opinion that the development likely failed to meet provincial regulations, which stipulate that buildings must be set back nearly twenty-three metres from the shoreline. In this case, the development was approved based on plans showing the building only about fifteen metres from the shore&mdash;hence the original stop-work order by officials. </p>
<p>A few months later, the Rasch family created a website to address community backlash and to counter what they call misinformation being circulated about the project. While admiring the spirit of the campaign against their new summer home, they insist that all activity on the site is lawfully permitted and that their development in fact improves accessibility for beach walkers while contributing to the local economy. The website maintains that the new armouring is safer and easier to walk around than the old seawall. The owners also argue that the new home, compared to what had previously existed, is set back farther from the ocean.</p>
<p>Mike Kofahl, a lawyer with East Coast Environmental Law, the firm hired by Guptill for a legal opinion, says that most coastal land below the high-water mark&mdash;where the water hits at high tide&mdash;is Crown land, often provincial Crown land. And unless there are restrictions on the use or access of that provincial Crown land, members of the public have a right of access. The provincial government website also makes clear that, on PEI, a beach below the high-water mark is provincially owned and the public has a right to use it in most cases.</p>
<p>So what happens when a beach that was once easy to cross is now blocked at high tide due to the impacts of coastal erosion? How does the government reconcile its commitment to coastal protection and the legal requirement to maintain beach access with the rights of private property owners? Should the province have required the new owners to build farther back in order to guarantee beach access, given that erosion had brought the old house precariously close to the edge of the shore? Provincial officials did not respond to numerous requests for clarity around the situation at Point Deroche or answer questions about beach access. It seems the PEI government is still trying to untangle the knots. </p>
<p>At the June rally, Rodd invited the premier to belatedly accept his group’s petition. On his way into the legislature, King listened for several minutes while Rodd repeated the group’s demands. Would he extend the moratorium on the development at Point Deroche until a full investigation was undertaken to see if the spirit of the law was followed? </p>
<p>At last, King politely addressed the crowd. Over occasional cries from the audience&mdash;<em>Follow the law! <em>This thing needs to be done!</em></em>&mdash;he spoke about his own connection to the Island. “I was born and bred in this province,” he said. “I hope to die and be buried here and I’m just going to try to make sure we leave it better for the next generation.” Before he left, he resolved to do everything he could to get to the heart of the matter. </p>
<p>A few weeks after the rally, an investigator with OmbudsPEI issued a letter to the Department of Environment, Energy and Climate Action, saying she was closing the file on a complaint made by Guptill about how provincial officials had handled the development. They concluded that the new seawall in fact is no taller than its predecessor and actually results in less of a footprint. In an email, Guptill told me the conclusion that the new seawall is smaller than the old wooden one is “ludicrous” and shows how government officials are trying to cherry-pick the facts to distort their rationale for approving the project. While Guptill is still hopeful the premier will reconsider the decision, he has not ruled out asking for a judicial review of the matter before the PEI Supreme Court.</p>
<p>For now, work on the property seems to continue. On a scorching day in early July, my partner and I hiked the beach from Blooming Point to Point Deroche. The tide was low, so we were able to skirt the shoreline between the grey boulders and the ocean. The armouring was in the process of being landscaped with the rich red Island soil. Staked into the sand at either end of the armouring were a pair of “Private Property” signs. A “No Trespassing” warning stood on the cliff. Meanwhile, looming high behind the stone hilltop&mdash;like a future fortress of reprieve from these troubled times&mdash;the foundation of the first new building slowly began to take shape. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/how-a-summer-house-triggered-an-existential-crisis-on-pei/">How a Summer House Triggered an Existential Crisis on PEI</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>In 2017, it felt like the whole country was swept up in the rah-rah celebrations around Canada 150. It was a collective anniversary, a chance to celebrate our history. Well, some of it, anyway. Tied to the many calls to explore the country and take stock of its many wonders, Parks Canada released its Discovery Pass, which granted free entry to all national parks that year. These natural spaces “represent the very best that Canada has to offer,” it announced in a press release. “They are the essence of our country because they tell stories of who we are, including the history, cultures and contributions of Indigenous peoples.” But, as Robert Jago explored in his timely essay, Canada’s parks program was built on the displacement of Indigenous peoples and the capture of their territories&mdash;a form of “green colonialism.” Parks are wonderful spaces, but they have also acted as political cover for the control of land, a tactic we still see used today.&mdash;Daniel Viola, senior editor, November 2023 issue </em></p>
<p><span class="dropcap">V</span><span class="smallcaps">ancouver’s Stanley Park</span>&mdash;a place known for its dense forests and primeval atmosphere&mdash;was, as recently as 150 years ago, home to Squamish villages. People lived there for thousands of years. On the eastern edge of the park, facing downtown, there is a little island known to the Squamish as skwtsa7s. Salish oral histories record that the island was the site of a siege, one that ended with a sacrifice described here by <em>Legends of Vancouver</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Out before a long file of southern warriors they stood. Their chins uplifted, their eyes defiant, their breasts bared. Each leaned forward and laid his weapons at his feet, then stood erect, with empty hands, and laughed forth his challenge to death. A thousand arrows ripped the air, two hundred gallant northern throats flung forth a death cry exultant, triumphant as conquering kings&mdash;then two hundred fearless northern hearts ceased to beat.

<p>Canadians have always thought of their country as an archipelago of cities in a sea of untouched wilderness. We see this idealized version of the country in everything from paintings by the Group of Seven to the works of Farley Mowat. It’s also a concept that the government likes to promote: forests, mountains, and lakes all featured regularly in Canada’s 150th anniversary promotions. Parks Canada also released its much-celebrated Discovery Pass, which granted free access to national parks for the year.</p>
<p>Many Canadians see the collective possession and exploration of this wilderness as a right of citizenship. But the pristine landscapes seen in government promotions&mdash;and the very concept of Canada as a wilderness&mdash;are unrecognizable to me and to other Indigenous people. In addition to being the sesquicentennial, 2017 was also designated as a year for reconciliation with First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples. As an ongoing part of this reconciliation, the government acknowledges the traumas of the residential school system. But it still celebrates other crimes&mdash;specifically, a parks system that has robbed and impoverished Indigenous peoples.</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century, some of our land was taken for farming; in the twentieth century, still more was appropriated for public works and military use. And all throughout these years, continuing to this day, thefts have been occurring under the guise of ecological preservation&mdash;green colonialism.</p>
<p>Many in Canada dismiss Indigenous peoples’ connection to the land as romantic and irrational. They say that we should abandon it to move closer to the urban areas for our own good. In a piece for <em>Maclean’s</em>, journalist Scott Gilmore wrote that First Nations must “leave these [remote reserves], forever” or, pending that, be sent “a backhoe as they keep digging graves.” Former prime minister Jean Chrétien has made similar statements. Indigenous people who don’t want to leave their land are simply “nostalgic about the past when they were going hunting and fishing,” he said in 2016. Even Jonathan Kay, a former editor-in-chief of this magazine, once stated that the abandonment of our homelands was the only way for Indigenous people to “make a living and exist in dignity.”</p>
<p>But the desire for the return of these lands goes beyond nostalgia. The places Canada has made into parks are filled with our stories&mdash;every mountain, every valley has a name and a history for Indigenous peoples. It is in these places that our history is alive: our Mecca is here, our Magna Carta, our Thermopylae.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="smallcaps">anada&#8217;s</span> parks departments have treated Indigenous peoples like an infestation ever since the founding, in 1885, of what is now Banff National Park. Looking out at the territories under his supervision, superintendent George Stewart demanded that “Indians” be barred from the area. “Their destruction of the game and depredations among the ornamental trees,” he wrote, “make their too frequent visits to the Park a matter of great concern.” In the early twentieth century, as non-native settlements such as Banff and Jasper grew, the livelihoods of First Nations peoples were destroyed.</p>
<p>This tactic soon became standard practice on other “protected” lands. In Algonquin Park, Algonquin people were denied title and recognition for their towns of Lawrence and Nightingale, which lay within the park’s boundaries. In 1895, Aubrey White, Ontario’s assistant commissioner of Crown lands, wrote of the presence of Algonquin people in language that we now reserve for the Asian pine beetle: “You know the predatory habits of these people, how they roam about, and how difficult it is to keep watch of their movements in the forest.” The Algonquin people were eventually forced out into distant reserves.</p>
<p>At a 2000 hearing before Canada’s heritage committee, James Plewak of the Keeseekoowenin Ojibway First Nation discussed the founding of Manitoba’s Riding Mountain National Park in the 1930s. “Our people were burned out of their homes,” he said. “Indians and parks were considered not to be compatible.”</p>
<p>Such actions are not relegated to the past. The government set a goal to designate 17 percent of Canada as protected space by 2020. To this date, protected areas are still being created without Indigenous consent. In 2016, Surrey Bend Regional Park was established in British Columbia within the territories of the Katzie and Kwantlen First Nations&mdash;land that is currently under negotiation as part of the Katzie treaty process. As Tumia Knott, councillor for the Kwantlen First Nation, says, “We’ve noticed that where these parks have been situated is rather strategic&mdash;they’re places of real significance and importance to Kwantlen.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">s Indigneous peoples</span> rebuild, we are striving to reconnect with our lost territories. This means reclaiming parks whenever possible and asserting stewardship and economic rights when we can’t get the land itself back. The modern fight to reclaim land began with the 1974 Ojibway occupation of Anicinabe Park in Kenora, Ontario. Since then, some battles have involved guns&mdash;during the Ipperwash Crisis in 1995, for example, unarmed First Nations activist Dudley George was killed by out-of-control police. Other fights have taken place in the courts&mdash;the landmark 1999 <em>R v. Sundown</em> decision, for instance, recognized First Nations’ traditional rights to establish hunting infrastructure in parks exempt from provincial regulation. Around the negotiating table, Indigenous peoples have worked to prevent the unilateral creation or expansion of parks at Pukaskwa, Point Pelee, Wager Bay, and Great Slave Lake by government.</p>
<p>In Vancouver, the Musqueam people have reclaimed portions of Pacific Spirit Regional Park and the surrounding area, near the University of British Columbia campus and on the western edge of Vancouver. Understandably, the Musqueam have done what anyone would do to a parcel of west-side Vancouver: they cut down some trees and plan to put up condos. Just like James Plewak said in reference to Riding Mountain National Park, these lands are “the most important resources we [have] to sustain our lives.”</p>
<p>The construction plans produced a litany of irony-immune quotes from local residents: “Once you’ve allowed a little bit of the park to be removed, no park in the whole province is going to be safe anymore”; “We don’t think it’s right that the government should take [land] and give it away”; “Are we going to go giving away parks like Stanley Park?” For centuries, First Nations have seen our land taken from us one piece at a time. It’s galling to see our words turned against us as we take our lands back.</p>
<p>Not every repatriation ends with two-bedroom condos. Some result in First Nations creating parks of our own. The Tŝilhqot’in Nation in BC turned much of its newly recovered lands into the Dasiqox Tribal Park. Elsewhere in the province, the Doig River First Nation has been struggling to establish the K’ih Tsaa?dze Tribal Park.</p>
<p>But these are not typical parks where nature is protected from human use. In an interview with the DeSmogBlog, Jack Woodward, a lawyer for the Tŝilhqot’in First Nation, explained that tribal parks are created to defend the “sustainability of the ecosystems necessary to support the aboriginal or treaty rights.” He explained that “a tribal park recognizes the fact that you can still live on the land, and make a living from the land.”</p>
<p>Such approaches face predictable non-native resistance. In Osoyoos, BC, a local newspaper published remarks from petitioners who were upset about First Nations involvement in a new park. The words of one stand out: “The ridiculous allowance that hunting is their right anytime any place will be the extinction of our wildlife.” Comments such as that are virtually identical to those spouted by the superintendent of Canada’s first park and show that far too little has changed in the past 150 years.</p>
<p>Canadians advocating for more protected spaces need to understand their own history. A major part of reconciliation is accepting that when we celebrate Canada 200, Algonquin people may again be living in Algonquin Park, and that Stanley Park and the turquoise waters of Moraine Lake in Banff National Park may be dotted with First Nations homes and businesses. Wilderness may be a sacred concept to Canadians, but it’s one that must be sacrificed if reconciliation is to have meaning. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/canadas-national-parks-are-colonial-crime-scenes/">Canada’s National Parks Are Colonial Crime Scenes</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

Skyscrapers. Central Park, with its sprawling lawns, trees, paths, vendors, a boathouse and restaurant: an urban refuge. Street performers at its edges. And people everywhere&mdash;in the park, on the streets. Tourists gawking, locals with places to be, a more urgent gait. At lunchtime, the restaurants are packed and efficient, set up for take-out and quick turnover. Fast-food joints: five minutes of eating, then dump your overflowing tray of coated paper, waxed or plastic cups, and Styrofoam shells into the garbage receptacle. More upscale spots: artisanal breads loaded with all the on-trend healthy ingredients, kombucha or green tea or decaf latte, double sugar, hold the fat. Still, the single-use cup, the single-use clamshell, the single-use cutlery, the single-use straw. Maybe eco-friendly-looking brown paper napkins. All tossed in the garbage or, covered with food scraps, into recycle bins. Which, then, magically disappear. Downtown Manhattan&mdash;you could eat off the streets. Where does all the garbage go? </p>
<p>Sure, there are dumpsters in back alleys, full to overflowing with garbage. Out of sight, out of mind. With an efficient waste management system, the city’s garbage literally disappears from view. It’s understandable that most people don’t concern themselves with it or wonder about where the garbage or their dirty recyclable materials are taken. By dropping their waste into the appropriate bin, they’ve done their duty. On to the next board meeting. </p>
<p>What if people were made aware that their dirty plastic waste is being packed onto container ships, bound for countries in Central America and Southeast Asia without the infrastructure or regulations to deal with it? Their plastic bottle of pure mineral water, now swirling in the tropical waters of the Andaman Sea, along with hundreds of tons of other plastic garbage dumped there&mdash;floating on the surface, suspended in the water column, filling the open mouths of manta rays. Or lying on the ocean floor, smothering coral reefs. </p>

</ul>
<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smallcaps">hen it comes</span> to our refuse, most people behave in a way they believe to be responsible and expect that things will be taken care of as they should be. The COVID-19 pandemic has given new life to this “throwaway living” mentality and to the plastics industry. A desire for the sterile and the safe has led to a major regression in our willingness to reuse just about anything. </p>
<p>In 2021, I worked with an aerial survey team housed at a mining camp on Baffin Island. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, all personnel were required to take food from the cafeteria, in single-use plastic containers, to their rooms upon arrival at camp. For the first eight days, I saved the containers, hoping I would find a use for them. I hadn’t accumulated plastic waste like this in years, and it made me feel a little bit sick. I invented uses for some of the containers, but most piled up, stacked in layers and flooding over my desk, inevitably ending up in the garbage. Baggies, clamshells of every size and shape, bananas and other fruit wrapped in cling wrap, all served in a plastic bag. After the eight days, you were allowed to use dishes and eat in the cafeteria, but food was often served up in disposable plastic containers anyway. If you wanted reusable tableware, you had to make a point of it. Most people didn’t. Plastic drink bottles were collected for recycling, and all other plastic was incinerated on site, great plumes of smoke rising into the Arctic sky.</p>
<p>Restaurants and food services all over the world moved toward single-use plastic as an immediate solution to concerns about contamination and the spread of COVID-19. Disposable items like masks proliferated. In 2020, an estimated 129 billion face masks and 69 billion disposable gloves were used globally every month; about 2 billion face masks ended up in the ocean that year. Perhaps because we are so accustomed to the single-use mindset, a more sustainable solution has not been considered for the long term as the pandemic drags on. </p>
<p>Since the 1960s, the medical establishment has employed disposable products to limit the spread of bacteria. But before then, reusable latex gloves were commonplace in the operating theatre. These gloves could be sterilized and were made to last. A surgeon would retain his pair over an entire career, moulded perfectly to his hand and cared for like the violin of a concertmaster.</p>
<p>Disposable latex gloves replaced the reusable ones; reusable cotton gauze masks were replaced by paper and then synthetics. By the end of the 1960s, most hospitals were moving toward a system of complete disposability. Single-use garments had the health benefit of guaranteed sterility, along with the convenience of being able to toss them rather than wash them. As with the emergency measures taken for COVID-19, there was no apparent consideration given to the long-term consequences or whether there might be a better way to protect human health while factoring in environmental impact. </p>
<p>During the early days of the pandemic, when the personal protective equipment (PPE) supply chain was under strain, health care professionals were reusing masks that had been effectively sterilized to address the shortage. As soon as single-use disposable masks became an option again, there was an immediate halt to this practice. Although reuse was short lived, it was a reminder that there are viable sterile and safe alternatives to complete disposability&mdash;ones that we are nowhere near ready to embrace. Yet.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic aside, we have known for some time that plastic has been accumulating around the globe to untenable levels, but efforts to address the problem have failed so far, and plastics continue to accrue. New plastics are being churned out at the rate of 380 million metric tons each year. In order to move forward, we have to first look back&mdash;to understand why we find ourselves in a plastic crisis and why efforts so far have failed to curb it. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he Möbius loop</span> symbol was launched on the first Earth Day, in 1970, and is recognized today as the international symbol for recycling&mdash;synonymous with the adage “Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.” The name Möbius might not be familiar, but the symbol for it is: the three broad arrows, folded over and chasing each other in a triangle. The very notion that recycling exists has led most of us to skip the first two “R”s and jump from “use” to “recycle,” entertaining the well-meaning but misguided assumption that the plastic will be kept out of landfills and in circulation, environmental damage averted. </p>
<p>The Möbius loop symbol was never patented. In 1988, the Plastics Industry Association developed a Resin Identification Code (RIC) made up of three chasing arrows with a number in the centre. The RICs range from numbers 1 to 7. The number is shorthand for the type of polymer that the plastic item is made from; it has nothing to do with recycling. But the striking (and suspicious) similarity to the Möbius loop symbol has created that impression. Polyethylene terephthalate (PETE or PET) is represented by the number 1 and is used for a multitude of single uses, including food packaging and beverage bottles. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) is represented by the number 2 and is frequently used for products like milk jugs, shampoo bottles, and other products with a similar texture. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is symbolized by the number 3 and used in some cling wraps; low density polyethylene (LDPE) is shown by the number 4 and used for plastic bags.</p>
<p>The confusion serves both plastic producers and product-packaging designers, who have not been above taking advantage of it. To see how this works, let’s have a closer look at cling wrap.</p>
<p>Dow Chemical developed polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) during World War II for military use. It was a thin film used to protect sensitive equipment from moisture, oil, and other potential contaminants. In 1952, it became a commercial product, available to the public under the trade name Saran Wrap. Cling wraps continue to be made of PVDC, PVC, or polyethylene (PE) today. </p>
<p>I haven’t used cling wrap since I became aware of the plastic problem a good five years ago and recently pulled it out of my kitchen drawer to have a closer look. So I can attest to its durability&mdash;it was as good as new after all that time. On the box are statements that suggest environmental sustainability, such as the fact that it is BPA free. An empty “recycle” symbol stands out&mdash;no number contained within because it is not referring to the product, which is a plastic resin, but to the cardboard carton it is packaged in, which is recyclable if it gets to an appropriate facility. There is no mention of the material that the cling wrap itself is made of, just that it does not contain BPA. And that it is microwave safe. </p>
<p>The packaging included an invitation to call a 1-800 number with questions, so I called. I got a recorded message, and the menu options stunned me. They referred solely to medical problems related to the use of their products: “If you have used one of our products and believe you may be having a health-related response to our product, please press 1 now to be transferred to a medical consultant available 24/7. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, please hang up and dial 911.” I was left with the impression that I would be better off eating the box than covering my food with the cling wrap.</p>
<p>No matter which polymer cling wraps are made of, they are not recyclable with current commercial recycling technologies. So the box the cling wrap is contained in is recyclable and environmentally sustainable, but the product is not. This is not at all obvious to the average consumer, and it is not meant to be. It’s just one example of the widespread problem of “greenwashing”: a deliberate attempt to create a false impression using misleading information or unsubstantiated claims to suggest that something is environmentally friendly, or at least sustainable. </p>
<p>In addition to the confusion over whether something is recyclable, there is wide variability in recycling capacity from one facility to the next. A plastic that has a number inside the recycling symbol may be recyclable&mdash;but only where the appropriate facilities exist. </p>
<p>It’s also generally unclear how to prepare plastics for recycling. There is the problem of recycling contamination&mdash;for example, when materials are not properly cleaned of food residue, like a yogurt cup that has not been rinsed before it’s tossed in the recycle bin. You see this kind of thing in airports all the time; ditto for public recycling bins. It is referred to as aspirational recycling—reflecting the hope that by simply throwing something into recycling, it will end up where it should be. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case. Those glass juice bottles, water bottles, and yogurt cups that get combined more often than not end up in the landfill. And one dirty yogurt cup is enough to contaminate the lot. It’s true that some facilities can deal with food contamination, but it’s best to assume that they cannot. More often than not, dirty recyclable plastics just end up as trash and can contaminate otherwise clean plastic in the airport recycle bin or the sorting facility, rendering it all as trash. </p>
<p>Last but not least is the confusion arising from terms like bioplastic, biodegradable plastic, and compostable plastic. All these terms suggest that the products thus labelled break down into natural constituent parts, returning to the environment and leaving it unscathed. But most bio-based and plant-based plastics contain toxic chemicals and are not much of an improvement over the standard petrochemical plastics. Compostable plastics are generally broken down only by commercial composters with temperatures exceeding fifty degrees&mdash;conditions not found in garden composts and certainly not in the open ocean. An experiment that looked at the rate of breakdown of various carrier bags found that the one labelled biodegradable was still completely intact after three years in a marine environment. </p>
<p>It is fair to say that there are some serious challenges around making informed choices, even when you want to do the right thing. Lost in the ambiguity of it all, some have just given up trying. And let’s be honest: not everyone tries. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">nother reason</span> for the plastic pileup is the ready availability of cheap virgin plastics&mdash;plastics that are derived from petrochemical feedstocks and have never been used or processed before. Of the 380 million metric tons of virgin plastic produced each year, between 35 and 45 percent is dedicated to single-use packaging&mdash;throwaway plastic by design.</p>
<p>The current linear system has resulted primarily because the economic opportunities in recovering plastics have not been recognized. In the absence of economic incentive, recycling rates have been abysmally low, and recycling has not turned out to be the panacea it was once thought to be. </p>
<p>The world’s richest countries have dealt with the spiralling plastic problem by trying to make it disappear, mostly by shipping plastic garbage offshore, generally to poorer, less developed countries with waste management laws and facilities that are inadequate at best. The sheer amount being shipped has overwhelmed the ability of these countries to recycle or repurpose the plastic, so it simply piles up, choking rivers and inundating beaches.</p>
<p>China was once the dumping ground for the world’s recyclable plastic waste. The landscape bore the legacy: until very recently, six of the twenty most plastic-polluted rivers in the world were in China. The Yangtze River had more plastic than the top twenty polluting rivers put together. China finally called a halt to all imports in 2018, which created a huge plastic backlog, and the US, Canada, and many countries in Europe subsequently tried to offload the surplus onto South American and Southeast Asian countries. Many countries on the receiving end of those shipments are awash with plastic. The river pollution statistics reflect the change. In 2021, the Pasig River in the Philippines contributed at least six times more plastic than any other river. Eight of the top ten most plastic-emitting rivers are found in the Philippines and Malaysia. Overwhelmed by the volumes and environmental impacts, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia have also taken action against foreign imports. In 2019, Malaysia demanded that countries&mdash;including Canada&mdash;take back a full 3,000 metric tons of their plastic waste. </p>
<p>Some remote islands find themselves at the receiving end of plastic waste carried by the currents&mdash;like ones in the Caribbean I visited on an expedition ship once. Here, plastic is an abundant, free, and “renewable” resource; it is burned as fuel for cooking. But there is a price to pay: the acrid smoke laden with toxic chemicals is released into the air and has led to respiratory diseases and other health issues among the population.</p>
<p>The practice of burning plastic is not limited to the remote islands of low-income countries. Incineration is one of the means used in landfills around the world for reducing garbage volumes, including a significant amount of plastic. Over 756 million metric tons of plastic has been burned in landfills globally. In 2016, the journal <em>Procedia Environmental Science</em> published a review summarizing the toxic effects of this practice on the environment and on human health. According to the article, plastic makes up 12 percent of municipal solid waste; about 40 percent of the world’s garbage is burned, releasing into the environment gases that contain dioxins, furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)&mdash;all chemicals that are not only highly toxic but known to be carcinogenic. According to the World Health Organization, dioxins can also cause reproductive and developmental problems, damage the immune system, and interfere with hormone function. And the list of harmful effects goes on. The chemicals released by burning polystyrene (found in Styrofoam) can damage the central nervous system. The brominated fire retardants act as mutagens as well as carcinogens. </p>
<p>The soot generated by burning plastic contains toxic components, including heavy metals. Some of the soot is carried by the wind and could be deposited anywhere&mdash;on land (including agricultural areas) and in both fresh and marine waters. </p>
<p>In this way, plastic incineration creates pathways for dangerous toxins to enter the environment and our bodies through the food we eat, the water we drink, and the air we breathe. But it is not the only route. And when plastic is burned, CO2 is released into the environment. We still struggle to find ways of dealing with plastic that do not create greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, the crisis is not going to go away unless there are aggressive, immediate, and coordinated international efforts and supporting legislation to cauterize the flow of virgin plastic production and the inevitable release into the environment. We need international efforts like those taken to protect whales from extinction. We need a complete paradigm shift. </p>

Tornados and storms would lash against a bunker in which he was huddled, at the bottom of a stairwell. Outside, the scene was utter devastation: a climatic apocalypse, with the sky turning unearthly colours. Sometimes even the Grim Reaper would make a cameo. Then Brothers would wake up, aware that he had spent another night in a climate-disaster dream. “It was regular enough that it was a part of my life,” he says.</p>
<p>The nightmares used to haunt Brothers more often when he was a PhD student in Berlin studying the interactions between climate change and lakes. They had become less frequent&mdash;receding into memory, though still vivid&mdash;by the time he was announced, in November 2021, as the <a href="https://www.rom.on.ca/en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Royal Ontario Museum</a>’s first curator of climate change. It’s a highly visible platform: located in Toronto, the ROM is one of the most visited museums in Canada. Brothers is the face of the museum’s efforts to insert climate change into more of its collection and public events. Yet, those expecting the museum to become an impassioned voice for greater climate action may initially be caught off guard. Much of Brothers’s focus is on the positive and not just the calamitous&mdash;on initiatives that are working&mdash;even if that’s not the tone some museum goers might expect. Where’s the rallying cry, they may ask. It shows the challenge the ROM and other museums face in finding the words to explain the science to a broad audience and to push for action while not disappointing those wanting to hear a more vociferous outcry.</p>

<p>Scientists have, of course, long warned about the climate crisis in the clearest possible language, even if words can feel so small against the magnitude of what is happening. Extreme weather, rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and acidifying oceans are all here now, bringing changes that “are irreversible and will be with us for centuries,” writes Joëlle Gergis in the essay collection <em><a href="https://www.nottoolateclimate.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Not Too Late</a></em>. Gergis is a prominent climate scientist and a lead author of a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report for the United Nations. “It’s an appalling reality to come to terms with,” she writes, “but just because the situation is dire doesn’t mean it’s too late to try to stabilize things.” This puts an onus on writers, curators&mdash;really, everyone holding the public’s attention&mdash;to continue to translate the science into a language of urgency and shared experience, a coming together to push beyond paralysis and fatalistic do-nothingness. “The question is, <em>How are you going to show up in this moment?</em>&thinsp;” Gergis writes, her italics looking us right in the eye. </p>
<p>Like other museums, the ROM is trying to straddle the call for action and the quieter world of peer-reviewed research. It’s a tricky balance. Brothers believes that it’s more effective for him, as a scientist, to present specific issues&mdash;such as ways in which water mismanagement can worsen drought conditions in lakes that are disappearing around the world and steps to improve that&mdash;than to wrap every case study in doomsaying.</p>
<p>Still, Brothers mentions his past nightmares as a sign that he’s not immune to a deep well of concern. Maybe the nightmares were a coping mechanism, catastrophizing at night, while he looked at what is working and built on that by day. “We’re definitely not doing what we need to do quickly enough, and we don’t know what’s going to happen with tipping points globally. There are limits to our knowledge.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;[However] I feel comfortable objectively saying that we are not in a state of inertia. There’s a lot that is happening very quickly,” he says. “I think a good way forward isn’t necessarily trying to make people more scared of climate change. It’s about making people less scared of climate solutions.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smallcaps">rothers grew up</span> a fifteen-minute walk from the ROM, a Toronto cultural mainstay since it opened its doors in 1914. His grandfather bought museum memberships for the family, and Brothers would sometimes go to the ROM daily to attend kids’ programs in the 1980s and ’90s. So he doesn’t like the possibility of ruining the experience he cherished, “of wonder and joy, coming to the ROM,” he says. As a child, he loved the bat-cave exhibit, and he hates the thought of adding an infographic at the end outlining the negative effect of climate change on bats, “just peppering bad news around all of the things that are there.” </p>
<p>Brothers has come to see his role not only as a museum programming specialist but also as a scientist who happens to be working in a curatorial position. He is also on the faculty at the University of Toronto, specializing in aquatic systems and climate change. These relationships are of paramount concern, particularly in how destruction within one ecosystem may cascade into other systems, worsening the damage. Then again, climate scientists such as Gergis emphasize that every preventative measure helps, every ton of carbon emissions diverted from the atmosphere matters, every fraction of a degree of warming counts. Brothers says that the museum wanted a scientist in the job who is actively participating in peer-reviewed literature, someone who would be able to “translate that to the public through the museum, using the museum.” Brothers has developed ideas for large exhibits entirely devoted to climate change and sustainability, but he’s not convinced that that’s the best way to reach visitors. Instead, he feels that weaving climate change into exhibits throughout the ROM would get the attention of those who might self-select out of seeing a climate exhibit, “and those are maybe the people we want to speak to the most.”</p>
<p>Philanthropists Allan and Helaine Shiff, who donated $1.5 million to kick-start the museum’s climate program and establish the curatorship, emphasized that they didn’t want visitors to come and see an interesting exhibit and then merely go about their day but, instead, leave feeling spurred on to take action. Brothers and climate change project coordinator Sarah Kamau have been given leeway to figure out how to accomplish this. It’s a slow process. Getting approval for a new exhibition case, developing the exhibit, evaluating its scientific integrity, and making sure it fits in with neighbouring exhibition cases and the work of other curators can all take months. Meanwhile, the barrage of climate news and public dialogue race ahead.</p>
<p>One exhibit, however, that did come together relatively quickly is the art installation <em><a href="https://www.rom.on.ca/en/exhibitions-galleries/exhibitions/noelle-hamlyn-lifers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Noelle Hamlyn: Lifers</a></em>, co-curated with Alexandra Palmer of the ROM’s textiles and costume department, which evokes a drowning world. Artist Noelle Hamlyn used more than twenty life jackets repurposed with materials taken from discarded clothing, along with ominous photography, to comment on how we are, in effect, drowning in fast fashion. Brothers notes that the stark imagery differs from his usual hopeful approach, “but I also like that we have that spectrum, as part of what people will experience with climate change programming at the ROM.”</p>
<p>Brothers has otherwise focused much of his time on developing guided climate tours of the museum, teaching, giving talks, and bringing community groups to the ROM to revisit its collection from a climate perspective, as well as participating in climate justice workshops. Talking with Brothers over a number of months, I saw a growing adamancy in how he describes his role as an activist within a large institution. “I know some people have different feelings towards activists, but when I started this job, I did consider this an activist position, in a way.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;What can the museum, as an institution, do that goes beyond just didactically teaching climate change and talking about it, but just really pushing action, making sure that new policies are going to come through?” he says. For instance, he has held museum tours and workshops for the staff of Ontario’s Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks, who are that much closer to actual policy. </p>
<p>When Brothers took me on the climate tour of the museum, he stressed the importance of individual fixes which alone won’t solve the crisis but are steps that must be taken&mdash;the kind of “imperfect victories,” as Gergis calls them, that edge us further along. Brothers points to Ontario’s phasing out of coal-fired electricity as an example of targeting specific goals: one step and then another. Still, Brothers doesn’t like being labelled an optimist. He hears that as a value judgment. Nevertheless, “I think that there are rational reasons to not just focus right now, at this time, on the worst-case scenarios,” he says, “because I think it’s really helpful to get people to see all of the positive changes that are happening.”</p>
<p>Those involved in climate science and policy, who have spent their lives warning of the crisis, might be stunned to find themselves now the voice of pragmatism, fighting the feeling of helplessness in others. “It started shifting the way I looked at it too,” Brothers says. Yet, while the empowering talk of climate initiatives tells part of the story, the visceral and physical wrenching of environmental destruction tells us the rest. As Greta Thunberg said to the <eM>New York Times</em>, “For me, living in a bubble of activists, it may seem like people know where we’re heading, people know what’s happening, people care. But when I move outside that bubble into the real world, then it strikes me every time that people are really living in denial.” </p>
<p>This seems to lead back to the sense of action getting mired in the shortcomings of language, the difficulty of finding a vocabulary that will click with everyone. In his 2019 book, <em>Underland</em>, nature writer Robert Macfarlane notes how environmental destruction can induce a loss for words: “It is, perhaps, best imagined as an epoch of loss&mdash;of species, places and people&mdash;for which we are seeking a language of grief and, even harder to find, a language of hope.” In a virtual ROM event, environmental scientist Katharine Hayhoe noted that we can’t wait for another David Suzuki to arrive with the right words to galvanize opinion, but that climate change is a justice issue that affects every person on the planet. Author and activist Rebecca Solnit, writing in <em>Not Too Late</em>, hears this as a call for a greater sense of community. She notes that when fellow writer and environmentalist Bill McKibben is asked what’s the one thing that people can do to fight climate change, his answer is simple: “Stop being an individual; join something.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he Carnegie museum</span> of Natural History in Pittsburgh takes a similar approach with its sense of community. It involves what Nicole Heller, associate curator of Anthropocene studies, describes as museums shifting away from a “didactic, one-way, let-me-tell-you-what-to-think” style. Instead, the aim is to create more of a two-way dialogue with people in the community, to hear about their experiences and attitudes, and to understand better what motivates them. As Brothers notes, museums may in fact be among the best institutions to accomplish this, given that they tend to be more trusted by the public. “In the last couple of years, there has been this whole change of tone of everyone realizing that they really need to use every single element they can of their collections and their staff to really push for cultural change as trusted cultural institutions,” says Brothers, relaying a point made by the ROM’s chief executive, Josh Basseches.</p>
<p>The question remains whether museums can adapt quickly enough to the immediacy of worsening climate news and the intense pace of new research. As Brothers is careful to note, “In science, every time you answer one question, you get two more thrown back at you.” He also sees another phenomenon emerging: <em>social</em> tipping points. Brothers feels that climate change communication has focused so much on how bad things can be rather than on what we can do. We also need “positive reinforcement,” he says. “This is what we’ve done.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;Now let’s do more.”</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-curator-of-climate-change/">The Curator of Climate Change</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

Bruising fall storms were a regular occurrence in South Carolina, where she and her wife, Evelyn, lived before moving to Prince Edward Island in 2020. When a monster hurricane named Fiona began tracking toward PEI last September, she and Evelyn remained calm. They reviewed their emergency plan. They stocked up on canned beans and smoked sausages. They dragged their mattress from their bedroom out into the living room, where there was less danger of a large window blowing in.</p>
<p>Out in rural Blooming Point, at her picturesque property on the northern shore of PEI, Debbie Langston followed the instructions provided by the provincial Emergency Measures Organization (EMO): storing extra water, filling the gas tank, making sure to have cash on hand. She moved her vehicles to a large field, away from the risk of falling trees. </p>
<p>Jim Randall wasn’t too worried about his family’s cottage in the low-lying Hebrides community, an ocean-facing peninsula along North Shore. It had been damaged by flooding during the post-tropical storm Dorian in 2019, and he’d paid $14,000 to raise the cottage by three feet as a hedge against future storm surges. The contractor had assured him he’d never have to worry about flooding again.</p>

<p>In Charlottetown, Tessa Rogers worked with some of the city’s marginalized residents, including community members who slept rough most nights. At the time, Rogers was the street outreach coordinator for PEERS Alliance (where Bradley was also on staff). She alerted the residents of a tent encampment in the city’s downtown core about an emergency shelter the province had set up just before Fiona was supposed to hit. In a scramble for time, Rogers and her colleagues told their clients that the shelter was in their best interests&mdash;though she soon found out that they would not have access to a working backup generator and no way to contact emergency services should landlines or cellphone services fail.</p>
<p>On September 22, the <a href="https://weather.gc.ca/hurricane/track_e.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Canadian Hurricane Centre</a> (CHC) was forecasting gusts up to and even more than 140 kilometres per hour, offshore waves ten to twelve metres high, and significant rainfall. At the province’s final EMO briefing, livestreamed at 1:15 p.m. on September 23, a clearly anxious Darlene Compton, then minister of justice and public safety, did her best to look battle ready. Fiona, just a few hours away by that point, was shaping up to be one of the most powerful storms in Canadian history. Compton urged Islanders to report storm damage online and to call 911 in the event of an emergency&mdash;despite the extreme risk of widespread power outages and the fact that telecommunication networks had been unreliable during previous storms.</p>
<p>At the same briefing, Tanya Mullally, the EMO’s emergency management coordinator&mdash;who, at the time, served as the acting director of public safety for the province&mdash;urged residents in low-lying areas to consider seeking higher ground. “Retreat indoors,” she said to Islanders at large. “Keep your families safe. We will kind of, I guess, see you on the other side of this.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="smallcaps">ike many islanders,</span> my partner and I spent the night of Friday, September 23, sheltered in a corner of our basement, listening to shrieking wind, the constant crack of splitting trees, the sickening rip of metal from the house. We live next to a number of towering poplar trees, which, on a fine summer’s day, shelter any number of starlings and blue jays as well as the occasional bald eagle. During the storm, these gorgeous giants&mdash;still covered in their heavy green foliage&mdash;became instant liabilities. We kept anticipating the moment we’d hear one of the trees come crashing through our roof. </p>
<p>As the storm intensified, Bradley was at home monitoring her social media feeds. A friend’s bedroom window had blown in. Glass balconies on the building across the street shattered and collapsed. She and Evelyn huddled together in the living room, without power, worried that the skylight in the next room would be sucked out by the storm.</p>
<p>When dawn arrived in Blooming Point, winds were still gusting up to 150 kilometres per hour. Langston got a peek of the destruction. “When we opened the blinds, it was just absolute devastation,” she says. Hundreds of trees were down, including over twenty that were now blocking her driveway. “We’ve been here for eighteen years. There would have been trees that have grown up as our kids have grown.”</p>
<p>Randall received a call from a friend over the weekend, telling him his cottage had disappeared. “Only when I went up on Sunday did I realize that the second floor of our cottage still existed,” he says, “but it was sitting on the edge of a causeway about 400 metres away from where our footings were. The bottom floor was missing.”</p>
<p>In Charlottetown, the emergency shelter where Rogers worked was nearly full, and the power was out. There was no fuel for the backup generator. She and other staff had to rely on their own flashlights and headlamps to escort agitated clients to the bathroom. Some of her regular clients were substance users who needed medication that could be dispensed only in daily dosages by a pharmacy. At least one person began to show signs of active withdrawal. Tensions were running high. With power out and cellphone services down, there was no way to reach emergency personnel should things escalate. “If anything happens, who has communication methods?” she remembers thinking to herself. “Because we don’t right now.” </p>
<p>As dramatic footage of devastated coastal communities dominated national news in the days after Fiona hit, debates began to rage about who should be accountable for securing Islanders and their properties from the impact of extreme weather. The government had been announcing for days that a so-called storm of the century was likely to strike the Island. Why wasn’t the province more prepared?</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">E</span><span class="smallcaps">ven as they</span> hunkered down to wait for Fiona, some Islanders were still recovering from Hurricane Dorian. The 2019 storm had knocked out power to nearly 80 percent of Island homes. It left fishing boats swamped, crops trampled, houses and cottages damaged. Some communities went without internet, landline, or cellphone coverage for extended periods, meaning they couldn’t reach emergency services. Some families in low-lying areas had to be evacuated from flooding. The damage to insured property was estimated at $17.5 million.</p>
<p>In Dorian’s aftermath, the provincial government engaged a consulting group to review its emergency efforts. The so-called <a href="https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/publications/final_calian_report_2020_1.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Calian report</a> pointed to insufficient staffing, inadequate equipment, poor communication, and a lack of adequate training among some provincial employees and emergency response workers as the reasons why the government hadn’t provided a more robust response. The report recommended, among other measures, that key emergency personnel adopt alternative communication methods, like a backup radio system, to be used in the event of power outages. It also said the government should provide clearer timelines to residents for when power would be restored and noted the need for more resources for checking in with vulnerable populations. It remains unclear whether the government adopted any of those recommendations in time for Fiona.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mullally says Dorian became an important reference point for the EMO’s plan to communicate with Islanders about Fiona’s potential damage. “We did say this could be as bad, if not worse,” she says. “We did speak to the historical significance of the storm surge being forecasted. So we were clear of what the potential impacts were.” But it’s not always obvious how being informed of what’s to come translates into being ready for it. </p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he wind and rain</span> began to settle late in the day Saturday, September 24. By then, the scale of Fiona’s devastation had started to filter through on social media&mdash;at least for the lucky few with service, data, and access to power. Premier Dennis King, ashen faced and looking overwhelmed, said the destruction was “beyond anything that we have witnessed before” but that Islanders should “count our blessings large and small” that there were no reports of significant injuries or worse. But there were disruptions to cellphone and landline services, making it difficult for some to contact 911. Without a backup generator, the province’s only major fuel terminal was unable to distribute gasoline, and lines soon grew massive at the few stations open. </p>
<p>By Sunday, the day after the storm, emergency reception centres began to pop up across the province to provide food, heat, and shelter to the displaced, though the recommendations to shelter in place remained in effect. In any case, many residents were barricaded in their homes by fallen trees and downed electrical wires. Islanders turned to live coverage from the CBC via battery-operated or hand-crank radios, though even CBC PEI was off the air in the first hours of the storm, going eerily silent until the national broadcaster was able to patch in rotating service from studios in Moncton and Halifax. Over 95 percent of the province would lose power, in some cases for three weeks. The provincial utility, Maritime Electric, came under intense criticism for being slow in restoring power and its failure to provide clear timelines early on.</p>
<p>It’s hard to accurately describe the sense of isolation and the deep unknown as we tried to cope without power, the nights growing colder and darker as scant information filtered in over the radio. I remember driving to the hockey rink of a nearby community to charge my phone, afraid of wasting our precious supply of gas by venturing too far. </p>
<p>Langston and her family went without power for nineteen days. If you live in a rural community, no power means you can’t pump your well. Without access to running water, Langston relied on daily sponge baths and occasionally showered at the homes of friends. She used water stored in her hot tub to flush her toilet&mdash;<br />
until that supply also ran out. She’d wait for daylight to arrive so she could apply makeup in front of her car mirror and would try to find a corner in a local school where she could connect virtually to work. Filling up plastic water bottles and receptacles at friends’ and neighbours’ homes became routine, as did cooking family meals over a small propane stove. </p>
<p>Across the Island, scores of schools were damaged, fishing wharves like Red Head Harbour virtually obliterated, bridges rendered impassable, and private homes and cottages destroyed. The overall damage wrought by Fiona in the region was estimated at $800 million, making it Atlantic Canada’s costliest weather<br />
event and one of the most expensive in Canadian history.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">N</span><span class="smallcaps">ot far from Langston,</span> a powerful storm surge of over two metres devastated the fragile barrier dune system along the North Shore. Between three and ten metres of coastline eroded within PEI National Park alone. Many of the Island’s iconic white sand dunes were sucked back into the ocean or severely damaged&mdash;along with campground sites, footbridges, walking and cycling trails, and even roadways. </p>
<p>Those same Instagram-worthy sand dunes and red shorelines draw millions of tourists to the province’s pristine beaches each year. As a low-lying, crescent-shaped sandbar set in the tempestuous Gulf of St. Lawrence, PEI is especially vulnerable to howling winter gales and raucous storms. The ecologically protective feature of the dunes underscores a deeply uncomfortable existential truth: the Island is gradually shrinking. </p>
<p>“PEI is very unique in terms of its landscape, because it’s so fragile,” says Xander Wang, associate professor at the <a href="https://www.upei.ca/school-of-climate-change-and-adaptation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">University of Prince Edward Island School of Climate Change and Adaptation</a>. “We don’t have this hard rock to protect it.” Unlike the granite coasts of neighbouring Nova Scotia, PEI is prone to extreme coastal erosion, magnified by rising sea levels. And at current erosion rates, which are thought to average nearly thirty centimetres per year, an estimated 1,000 structures on PEI&mdash;homes, cottages, and businesses&mdash;might fall into the sea by the end of this century.</p>
<p>Scientists say climate change will worsen the impact of storms in Atlantic Canada. For one thing, warmer water can lead to higher wind speeds, creating more intense and, in some cases, slower-moving storms. “They don’t move quite as fast, and it tends to be a more meandering path,” says Chris Fogarty, a meteorologist at the CHC. The warming of the polar regions in particular has a direct effect on the paths of storms like Fiona. As the storms stall, rainfall accumulates quickly, increasing the potential for catastrophic flooding. </p>
<p>Low atmospheric pressure at the eye of a storm produces more intense conditions; Fiona’s pressure was among the lowest ever recorded in Canada. It also merged with a cold air mass from the north, magnifying its severity. “Fiona was not purely hurricane,” says Fogarty. “It had the power and vigour of a hurricane from the warm air and moisture from the tropics, but it also grabbed this energy from the colder air mass from Quebec.” The clash of the two systems made Fiona’s behaviour more severe. And it offered a disturbing taste of what’s becoming ever more common. </p>
<p>Canada has the longest coastline of any country in the world, and both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts will feel the impact from rising seas. In PEI, sea level rise leading to higher waves&mdash;coupled with human activity, like increased cottage development close to the shore&mdash;means even a typical seasonal storm will produce more damage than in the past. </p>
<p>Over the last year, the PEI and federal governments have introduced their respective climate adaptation plans, both of which call for building capacity for “disaster resilience” and protecting natural coastal assets. The provincial plan includes developing a coastal flood warning system that will alert communities and residents in real time, on various platforms, about the potential risk to coastal activity and infrastructure. The province’s Coastal Hazards Information Platform (CHIP) now provides detailed maps of regions and specific properties at risk of coastal flooding. All of this knowledge means policy makers and residents alike possess a clear road map for curtailing, to some extent, the damage associated with storms like Fiona.</p>
<p>But exactly who is responsible for implementing climate adaptation measures is a complicated question. A fishing harbour may be managed by the federal government, while protecting the nearby coastline is the responsibility of the province. Adapting the roads fishers use to access their boats may fall under municipal control. Finger pointing between various levels of government and wrangling over funding can bog down planning and stymie the far-reaching changes experts say are needed to protect lives, natural assets, and property from future risk. Of all the challenges ahead, this might be the most daunting one.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">a</span><span class="smallcaps">day after</span> Fiona struck PEI, a shaken Premier King asked the federal government for support. Within days, the Canadian military had a hundred soldiers on the ground to help clear fallen trees and repair key infrastructure. The Canadian Red Cross and a handful of non-governmental organizations set up operations to provide food and funnel donations to communities. Yet frustrations with ongoing outages and the slow pace of government efforts, including the rollout of immediate financial aid, mounted. The provincial government made an initial cheque of $250 available per eligible resident, to be administered through the Red Cross, though even this simple gesture turned into a logistical nightmare. Many residents with limited means had to drive for up to an hour to wait in daylong queues to register for the funding, with no guarantee they’d even see a Red Cross representative. Stories of people turned away abounded. Rogers tried to help her clients access aid by vouching for those without formal identification. She was finally able to secure a pop-up event for her clients with Red Cross staff in November, nearly six weeks after the storm, but only because she managed to track down a Red Cross employee via LinkedIn.</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of the storm, many Islanders stepped up. One group formed an organization called <a href="https://charlottetownmutualaid.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Charlottetown Mutual Aid</a>, which cooked hot meals; collected donations of clothes, tents, and food; and helped funnel direct financial aid to those most in need across the city, including seniors, students, and people experiencing homelessness.</p>
<p>But stories of those left to fend for themselves also emerged. A community of seniors in Charlottetown was left shivering in the dark for over ten days in their government-owned seniors complex. When the generator in their building failed, residents were forced to huddle under blankets to keep warm. At another home, at least six seniors experienced falls during periods of extended darkness.</p>
<p>Mullally, who served as the face of the government in daily briefings, praised the efforts of the Islanders and communities coming together after the storm. At the same time, she later told me, in any emergency, Islanders need to learn to plan for themselves and their families. </p>
<p>“As individuals, we need to know what our risks are. We need to determine how to best prepare for ourselves,” she says. “Personally, I had the benefit of a generator in my home. But I still have to plan and I still have to prepare because a generator may not come on.”</p>
<p>Mullally and others working in emergency response believe there’s a window of about six months following a disaster to effect cultural change within the sector, after which time memories&mdash;and interest&mdash;begin to fade. Her office needs more resources to proactively engage with Islanders about emergency planning, she says, and it needs to coordinate more efficiently with partner organizations&mdash;like NGOs, government departments, utilities, and local municipalities&mdash;many of which use wildly different IT and database systems. As of mid-July, the most recent update to the PEI All Hazards Emergency Plan is from 2021. All this means that nearly a year after Fiona, the provincial government still doesn’t seem to have figured out how it will tackle the next inevitable large-scale disaster.</p>
<p>Last November, King’s Progressive Conservative government voted down calls led by then opposition leader Peter Bevan-Baker for a full public inquiry into the government’s response to the storm. “Without the ability to compel documents and subpoena witnesses,” says Bevan-Baker, the province’s Green Party leader at the time, “we’ll never know exactly what went wrong, and how we could learn from it for next time.”</p>
<p>“In so many ways, we’ve lost some of our innocence because of what we went through with Hurricane Fiona,” King said in a statement emailed to The Walrus. “Our landscapes have changed, our perspective has changed, and it’s no surprise that our approach to future weather events has to change as well.” The province, he added, has commissioned Dave Poirier, a former chief of police, to conduct a third-party review of its response efforts; as of this writing, the results are expected in time for this year’s hurricane season. The government has also directed more funding to the EMO office to help “adequately plan and strengthen response efforts for future emergencies.”</p>
<p>But many of those I spoke with are still not confident that the province will be ready for the next storm. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n the Netherlands,</span> the government has poured billions into defending low-lying coastlines from flooding. England has designated shoreline management “cells” or regions that employ adaptation methods tailored to local circumstances, such as retreating from the coast in less populated areas. In Canada, we’ve barely begun the conversation around what it looks like to manage coastlines against rising sea levels, says Joanna Eyquem, a climate adaptation expert at the University of Waterloo, who authored a study looking at climate adaptation models around the world. All provinces and territories have now signed on to the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-plan/national-adaptation-strategy.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Adaptation Strategy</a>, a federal plan to build climate resilience across the country, which was released with great fanfare last year. It comes with $2 billion in funding to help protect infrastructure and prepare communities for climate change, but experts say the amount is well below what is needed given the herculean tasks ahead. And while the plan earmarks an additional $530 million for a Green Municipal Fund so cities and smaller communities can launch local adaptation projects, some believe that we need to think bigger.</p>
<p>In PEI, an estimated 90 percent of the Island’s total land area falls outside municipal planning regulations. This means residents in unincorporated rural areas enjoy the relative freedom to develop their properties as they please, even if such development puts the property or nature at risk. As one example: coastal residents often “armour” the coast by importing rock from the mainland or depositing recycled concrete at the base of cliffs to delay erosion, though the provincial government has recently announced a moratorium on this practice while it ponders new regulations.</p>
<p>Hope Parnham, a landscape architect and a planner doing research into shoreline erosion on PEI, says armouring is countereffective. While it might protect a sliver of land in the short term, over the medium term, it undermines neighbouring properties and disrupts the overall integrity of the coastline. And while the province maintains a “buffer zone” regulating development within fifteen metres of inland or coastal shorelines, Parnham says exceptions are made on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Over the past fifty years, there have been repeated calls for province-wide legislation to regulate land use, including development in sensitive coastal areas. But such a plan, says Parnham, is still at least a few years away. Meanwhile, with a booming population, the province faces an acute housing shortage, which is why some Islanders will likely continue to build outside municipal boundaries&mdash;on lots along highways, carved from prime agricultural land, or along sensitive and eroding coastlines.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">P</span><span class="smallcaps">arks Canada staff on pei</span> recently announced their adaptation plans, which include a managed retreat from coastal areas in PEI National Park that were damaged by Fiona. This doesn’t mean that millions of visitors will lose access to the Island’s beloved beaches. It does mean that certain assets (a paved causeway, for example) will be removed or adjusted to adapt to erosion and future storm surges. Some park infrastructure&mdash;like modular bunkies or cabins&mdash;will be dynamically flexible, able to be moved back when storms approach and as the coastline continues to retreat naturally. </p>
<p>The term “managed retreat” can often invoke the spectre of entire communities being moved or abandoned, but Parnham says it usually occurs one property at a time and can happen as people naturally age out of their homes. Several climate researchers I spoke to believe this type of managed retreat may be the only option for certain properties most at risk. The approach is favoured by climate adaptation specialists like Eyquem who argue for the need to work with nature’s cycles. Nature-based protection&mdash;such as introducing natural wetlands or planting intertidal reefs&mdash;can better absorb the energy of powerful waves and slow down the impacts of erosion. </p>
<p>But the question of who should finance this kind of work or compensate homeowners is far from settled. Most insurance companies do not currently cover losses incurred by coastal storm surges. Seasonal homeowners are not eligible for federal or provincial Fiona disaster recovery programs, which means Randall will receive no compensation for his cottage, a major asset he and his family had hoped to pass on to the next generation. He now owns an empty plot in a floodplain; it’s hard to even guess at the property’s value.</p>
<p>While he applauds the provincial government’s focus on climate adaptation efforts, he would like to see funding available to buy out owners whose properties are at high risk of flooding&mdash;or perhaps subsidies for climate adaptation efforts, like lifting properties onto posts so they can better withstand future storm surges. </p>
<p>Eyquem has a different take. She believes the greater burden for protection and adaptation in cases like Randall’s should rest on the individual property owner. In most cases, disaster relief programs currently provide financial aid to uninsured homeowners, some of whom may have willingly built homes in high-risk areas.</p>
<p>“I don’t really like the feeling that money from ordinary taxpayers is going to people who are knowingly building in floodplain areas,” she says. “That’s not really fair.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="smallcaps">tephanie arnold</span> spent the night of Fiona mostly sleepless, worried about water seeping into their house. A PhD candidate at UPEI and a staff member at Climatlantic, a federally funded agency providing regional climate adaptation services, their research looks at helping farmers on PEI plan for warming temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. </p>
<p>Arnold is also the current board president of <a href="https://www.bipocushr.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BIPOC USHR</a> (Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour United for Strength, Home, Relationship), a not-for-profit support and advocacy organization for BIPOC folks on PEI. Part of BIPOC USHR’s work is to reframe the conversation around climate change. For Arnold, this means acknowledging that climate change has deep roots in colonization and the exploitation of lands and resources. “If we don’t also address those root causes, we’re only putting on Band-Aids,” they say. “And these Band-Aids are only helping specific groups of people.” </p>
<p>Part of their work, both at Climatlantic and BIPOC USHR, involves bringing people from communities whose perspectives have been traditionally marginalized into the climate conversation. That could mean engaging with migrant workers, who increasingly produce much of the Island’s food and many of whom experience inadequate housing, low wages, and poor living conditions. Addressing such injustices might lead to a healthier and more sustainable workforce, helping to improve crop yields at a time when climate change is contributing to food insecurity. But the government and other sectors have been slow to adopt this type of  holistic approach. “Sometimes policy makers fall into the trap of making decisions for the communities,” says Arnold, “but not with the communities.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">k</span><span class="smallcaps">rystal pike</span> lives on what was once a largely forested rural property but which lost much of that forest cover during the storm. In the days following Fiona, they helped friends and neighbours clear fallen trees from roads with a chainsaw, clean up brush, and haul debris to dump sites. It was only once the adrenalin had subsided that Pyke began to realize the magnitude of their own personal loss. “About two weeks later, when I walked into my forest, I literally fell to the floor crying,” they say. “The trails were gone. The nests were gone. The rabbit paths were gone.”</p>
<p>Coming to terms with destructive events like Fiona can trigger powerful and overwhelming emotions, in part because of the powerlessness we often feel in the face of climate catastrophe. In the months following the storm, Pyke, the ClimateSense project manager at UPEI’s School of Climate Change and Adaptation, organized two community events for Islanders to talk about their experiences of Fiona, including sharing stories of grief. A common theme that emerged was a feeling of disorientation, or what’s known as “sola-stalgia.” It’s a term gaining traction in climate change circles that loosely translates to the loss of a place that once brought you solace. For Pyke, it was important to name what had been lost. “There was a lot of talk about the struggle of moving forward knowing those places don’t exist.”</p>
<p>Almost everyone I spoke to about Fiona has their own story of loss, from viewscapes and trails to the feeling of security and safety. Like many Islanders, my partner and I miss the towering dunes lost at Brackley Beach. Jim Randall still keeps the key to his cottage front door on his keychain, even though there is no door left to unlock. Debbie Langston mourns the dead trees that litter her property and is still jolted afresh by the wide open skyline. </p>
<p>Iconic Teacup Rock&mdash;a fixture along North Shore and a draw for locals and visitors&mdash;collapsed during the storm. Hope Parnham has fond memories of taking photos there with her children each summer but says it’s vital to remember that the Island is a naturally eroding land mass. Before Teacup Rock, there was Elephant Rock&mdash;another popular sea stack structure, in the western part of the Island, lost to erosion and an earlier storm. “It’s like watching the cycle of life.”</p>
<p>But even in the face of larger natural processes, human decisions play a role in the destruction. Parnham is optimistic that Islanders can adapt&mdash;if the government leads the way. “People are going to rebuild this year,” she says, “and they need to know how.” </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/prince-edward-island-storm/">Can Prince Edward Island Survive Another Big Storm?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p><span class="dropcap">E</span><span class="smallcaps">ach year,</span> Canadians throw away the equivalent of 300,000 garbage trucks of plastic waste. But only 9 percent of that gets recycled. Many of the items we’ve grown to rely on every day&mdash;Tim Hortons coffee cups, grocery-store bags, takeout cutlery&mdash;end up in landfills or, worse, in our rivers and lakes. In an attempt to achieve zero plastic waste by 2030, Canada has banned the use of these products, with retailers swapping single-use items for seemingly more sustainable alternatives. But in the months since the regulations were first enacted, environmentalists have expressed concerns over how the increased demand for paper could create an entirely new problem by putting more pressure on Canada’s <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/forestry/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">forests</a>. Is the federal government’s strategy actually working? To find out, we spoke with Toronto Metropolitan University’s <a href="https://www.torontomu.ca/gcm/about/faculty-and-staff/natalia-lumby/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Natalia Lumby</a>, whose research focuses on sustainable packaging.  </p>
<p><strong>Paper has earned a reputation as a sustainable alternative to plastic. We see it used in paper straws, paper cups, and paper bags. But how will the shift from plastic to paper affect Canada’s pulp industry? Should we be concerned?</strong></p>
<p>I favour looking at the whole system and believe we need to promote sufficiency to stop excessive consumption. The answer is: neither is good. We want to reduce our use of plastic, and we want to reduce our use of paper. Both are limited resources, and both have their own challenges. I believe that paper is viewed favourably for the right reasons. Paper is a renewable resource. We have the capacity to grow trees, we should grow trees, and we can harvest and regrow in a way that you never can with plastic. In future, plastic is going to be a real problem, so the system should shift earlier rather than later.</p>
<p>I am of the mind that if we move away from paper as a natural resource, we’ll actually see a decline in forests. In Canada, few of our forests are privately owned. We actually manage our forests through the government, and there are caps and quotas on how much logging you can do within Canada. Have companies pushed those boundaries inappropriately? Perhaps yes. But generally speaking, from the perspective of the volume of trees, we are well managed. For me, any shift toward paper products is a positive shift [for the] long term, systemically speaking, because trees help with decarbonization in a way that plastic could never do.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2020/04/30/plastic-paper-cotton-bags/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A 2014 study</a> that looked at the emissions created by producing a paper bag versus a plastic bag found that producing paper bags can sometimes create more CO2 emissions and use more water and fuel than plastic bags. Are there instances where we should consider using plastic bags?</strong></p>
<p>To consumers in Toronto, it feels like plastic bags have quite suddenly been banned in stores. So is a paper bag better than a plastic bag? Plastic does not biodegrade, so even if the CO2 emissions are higher, it’s neither here nor there, because we are stuck with the plastic bag. It then ends up in the ocean and pollutes our water system, creating issues there. Paper will decompose and is regenerative in a way that plastic currently is not.</p>
<p>But in the short term, locally, the government has banned plastic bags and, in their place, they’ve essentially put in plastic-but-woven bags, which are sold for anywhere from 35 cents to $2.99 instead of the 5 cents you were paying for a plastic bag. I’m most surprised that my local retailers haven’t put out corrugated boxes for consumers. This solution would be one of responsible reuse. Consumers need time to shift their shopping behaviours. They are showing up without bags and buying more of these harmful reusable bags than they could ever need. These bags are awful for the environment if they are not used for a long time repeatedly. These unintended consequences during system shifts are really important. It’s just a matter of extending that legislation a little bit more and seeing that the replacement for plastic bags is something better for the environment. I favour corrugated boxes that the store already has hundreds of and could provide for free.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2023/04/how-unnecessary-paper-packaging-creates-the-illusion-of-sustainability" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A <em>Harvard Business Review</em> article</a> looked at how paper packaging is now being unnecessarily added to plastic products to make them seem greener. Do you think we’re creating a new problem by eliminating single-use plastic? </strong></p>
<p>Single-use plastic is being eliminated in very specific places in Canada, but the legislation has not yet reached products. Companies are starting to use paper in their product packaging to seem more environmentally friendly, but because they need to protect their products, they are often needing to use multi-layer substrates. The outer layer is paper, and the inner layers are a variety of plastics and foils. Perhaps you’ve seen things like eco deodorants that will come in a paper-looking box, and then if you take that apart, it’s a multi-layer film, so it’s not paper. This is a form of greenwashing.</p>
<p>Multi-layer substrates are a problem because it’s very difficult to take the layers apart and dispose of them properly, so they end up in landfills. However, the plastic and films industry is working hard to create mono material solutions for packaging that will make them much easier to recycle. </p>
<p><strong>So if it starts with restaurant takeout, I assume that will eventually trickle into other sectors? </strong></p>
<p>I would say my hope for this single-use plastic ban is that instead of targeting the places you find single-use plastic, we learn, as a government and as a society, to change behaviour. At the grocery store, asking shoppers to bring their own bags is a consumer behaviour we are trying to adjust.</p>
<p>We have to, as a society, become more selective about which products we truly need, and that will reduce the impact of packaging. We have to, as a government, invest in the management of the packaging once the product is used. Our legislators are attempting to do that by using extended producer responsibility (EPR).</p>
<p>The shift that I would really like to see is a system shift, a change in some of our defaults. I would love to have to ask for cutlery at a store as opposed to finding it in my bag even though I didn’t ask for it. I would love to have to ask for a to-go cup, because it is normal to sit for a cup of coffee served in a ceramic mug.</p>
<p><strong>In <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/news/high-levels-forever-chemicals-found-paper-takeout-containers-study">a University of Toronto study</a> that came out earlier this year, researchers examined compostable paper takeout containers and found the presence of toxic “forever chemicals” that aren’t great for our health and for our environment. Is there a lesser of two evils here? </strong></p>
<p>We interact with toxic chemicals all the time. And again, for me, it comes back to legislation. When plastic first came out, it contained chemicals that were not okay. We ended up banning BPA [from certain products], and then plastic became safer. That same cycle will happen with any new substrate you put into the system, so, yes, it’s totally believable to me that they found those chemicals, because we have to develop a whole new process to make paper plates. When we’re creating these new substrates now, I think they need to go through that shift in order to find a new solution. Legislation and rigorous testing will help keep everyone safe as these products are developed. Ideally, this will prevent these negative iterations of the process from being released to consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Late last year, <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/tim-hortons-previews-new-packaging-and-cutlery-that-will-roll-out-across-canada-in-2023-and-launches-trial-of-recyclable-fibre-hot-beverage-lids-in-vancouver-820555586.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tim Hortons</a> announced plans for new packaging made from wood fibres. Is it actually a decent solution?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think pulp fibre for the lids is a good solution, given the limited options that they have. I think where I worry is on the collection side. People are already confused about whether the cup is paper or not. I don’t think the new Tim Hortons cup is changing&mdash;it’s just the lid. So it’s about consumers knowing where to put the cup and where to put the new lid. This will require some consumer education. As long as the collection is well executed, then I think it’s a viable option.</p>
<p><strong>Tim’s also experimented with a pilot project introducing a reusable cup that you can bring back and trade in. Is that better than the plastic grocery-store bags situation?</strong></p>
<p>Reusables are an emerging hot topic in research. I think they’re a great solution as long as they think through the incentive to bring these containers back for actual reuse. <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/media-center/innovating-beyond-the-traditional-package" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Coca-Cola Freestyle</a> is a good example of this. They made the package the payment device. There’s a radio frequency identification (RFID) chip in the durable plastic bottle, and the refill system works by putting your bottle into the dispenser, and then you fill it up with whatever Coca-Cola product you prefer. When you put your bottle down, it knows to charge you for that coke. It acts almost like a wallet. This is why, instead of consumers buying many durable bottles, they keep returning with one, which promotes the sustainable behaviour we want to see.</p>
<p><strong>How much more expensive is it to use sustainable packaging? These multi-million-dollar companies can surely afford to redesign their packaging, but what happens to your local mom-and-pop shop?</strong></p>
<p>Sustainable packaging is currently more expensive, because it’s not at scale. So as we legislate toward sustainable packaging to increase this scale-up, will some businesses struggle? Yes. But I think, for the most part, one good thing about capitalism is where there is demand, the market will flock, and a shift will occur. Markets will drive toward the solutions that are allowed, and this is why legislation is really important. People in consumer packaging will tell you that an elective approach to sustainability, which means that they have to either bear the cost or pass it to their consumer, is difficult. The minute we legislate a specific solution to be more sustainable, we level the playing field, allowing companies to make those investments. The large consumer goods companies that drive plastic pollution and packaging pollution can have a lot of impact. It is not that they don’t have the capability of switching. It’s that they don’t have the capability of being the only one who is switching.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any thoughts on why we, as a society, especially in North America, are so reliant on single-use everything?</strong></p>
<p>I think we have a hustle culture, as well as a growing disparity in income&mdash;even in Canada, which we like to think is a little bit socialist. I think all of these behaviours are bandwidth problems. I am by no means a perfect consumer at all, and I use single-use things as well. When does it happen? It happens when I don’t have enough time to drop off my kids at school, and I haven’t had a chance to have a coffee and I’ve got a meeting at 8:45 a.m. These things cascade, and I have to use the option that is available to me. Our culture of success equals constant work, and the value of humans equals making more money. You cannot get away from this being a philosophical discussion. We won’t get away from single-use anything if we don’t have time to wash our dishes. What we’re left with are solutions that are a bit better, but they’re never going to be perfect, because the problem is not the packaging.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/sustainable-packaging/">When It Comes to Packaging, What’s Actually Sustainable?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>
