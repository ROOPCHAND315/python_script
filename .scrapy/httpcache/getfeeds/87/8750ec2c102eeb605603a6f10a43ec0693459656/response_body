Jean Carroll <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/e-jean-carroll-discusses-trumps-comeuppance" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was asked</a> whether her legal victory against <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/donald-trump/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a> represented the former president’s long-awaited comeuppance. Her response captured the spirit of the moment: “I think it just may be.”</p>
<p>She appeared tentatively hopeful. The interview was published two and a half weeks after <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/e-jean-carroll-trump-lawsuit-battery-defamation-verdict/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a jury found</a> Trump had sexually abused Carroll. Finally, a court of law had nailed Trump for his frequently repulsive behaviour toward women. Just thirteen days after that verdict, he was indicted on <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-2nd-indictment-1.6870727" rel="noopener" target="_blank">thirty-seven criminal charges</a>, including conspiracy to obstruct justice. He could face up to twenty years in prison if convicted on all charges. And this week he was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66263089">indicted once again</a>: four more counts for attempting to upend the 2020 presidential election results.</p>
<p>Some of his most prominent allies are also in trouble. In April, Tucker Carlson <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/4/25/23697600/tucker-carlson-tonight-fox-news-dominion-lawsuit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was fired</a> from Fox News, excused from the show that bore his name and which was, for a time, the most watched cable news program in history. And in May, George Santos, a Trump-aligned congressman whose myriad lies about his biography have made international headlines, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/congressman-george-santos-charged-fraud-money-laundering-theft-public-funds-and-false" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was charged</a> with a slew of crimes, including wire fraud and money laundering.</p>

</ul>
<p>I’ve taken pleasure in watching Trump and those who propped him up finally face some kind of reckoning. If a progressive’s aim is to defeat the enemies of progress, then we’ve lurched ahead in the war against injustice. Why shouldn’t I savour these wins? </p>
<p>What I’m experiencing is schadenfreude, a German term for the pleasure we derive from the misfortune of others. There isn’t a precise English equivalent. Sadism comes close, but the sadist gets off on inflicting pain. As Tiffany Watt Smith <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/oct/14/the-secret-joys-of-schadenfreude-why-it-shouldnt-be-a-guilty-pleasure" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote</a> in the <em>Guardian</em>, schadenfreude is a spectator sport. </p>
<p>And who is a better target for schadenfreude right now than Trump? A man who won the presidency by painting Hillary Clinton as a criminal, who spent every day of his presidency punching down on those with the least privilege, who has arguably fostered more division and vitriol than any other figure in my lifetime. Naturally, his defeat, which for a long time seemed impossible, will come with a tasty shot of pure dopamine. </p>
<p>But what happens when that dopamine subsides? Even if Trump goes to prison for the rest of his life, and even if every single one of his allies were to join him there, the world they helped usher won’t immediately disappear. In twenty states, gender-affirming care has been banned for people under the age of eighteen. That situation directly affects more people than Trump’s indictment ever will. The Supreme Court has been stacked with Trump-appointed conservative justices and&mdash;no matter Trump’s fate&mdash;it will likely remain so for the foreseeable future.  </p>
<p>Canadian progressives have their own political opponents. In New Brunswick, Bill Hogan, the minister of education and early childhood development, recently amended a policy so that teachers will no longer need to respect their students’ preferred pronouns, a move that pro-trans advocates lambasted. Alberta premier Danielle Smith, who secured a decisive majority in the election in her province in May, compared vaccinated people to Adolf Hitler’s followers (she later apologized for those comments). <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/quebec/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Quebec</a> premier François Legault also won a comfortable majority after implementing controversial policies like <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/our-national-silence-on-bill-21/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bill 21</a>, which bars people working in public positions from wearing religious garments, and which has most <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bill-21-impact-religious-minorities-survey-1.6541241" rel="noopener" target="_blank">acutely affected</a> Muslim women. Most worrisome of them all is <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/pierre-poilievre/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pierre Poilievre</a>, a hard-core partisan with a populist flair who, based on the latest data, is <a href="https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/pierre-poilievre-s-conservatives-widen-their-lead-over-justin-trudeau-s-liberals-with-vast-majority/article_239eebc7-d0ea-5a80-b921-1e1020583f63.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">leading opinion polls</a>. </p>
<p>It would be easy to take to social media and pine for the downfall of these politicians. But schadenfreude is not progress. Progress, for me, has always been a positive word. It conjures the principle of the good fight. It implies an aspirational desire to do good by others, not a thirst for retribution. Progress is justice for marginalized peoples which, for starters, looks like material reparations. It is an unwavering recognition that what a human can be is fluid, and it’s a commitment to securing equality and equity for all, even if someone’s life experience or identity is different or unfamiliar. For some, it can look like ousting conservatives and voting progressives into power, but electing a certain kind of politician from a certain section of the political spectrum surely offers an inadequate measure of progress.</p>
<p>There is no political capital in schadenfreude. Things can improve if we demand improved treatment from our governments through activism and collective action and vocal criticism and votes, but more lasting change will arise if we cultivate an environment where basic human decency is not up for debate. Progress is rarely as visible and concrete as a court decision. It is slow and difficult to measure but always, even in small ways, in motion. </p>
<p>In June, a San Diego library suddenly found itself out of books to place in its Pride Month display. The mystery soon unravelled: the library received an email from anti-LGBTQ community members who said they had checked out nearly all the queer and trans books from the library. They threatened to hold the books hostage unless the library expelled them from its catalogue. But after the story was reported in the local paper, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/22/us/pride-books-library-protest.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">something wonderful happened</a>. Boxes on boxes full of replacement books arrived at the library, and the system received a $30,000 infusion to buy more <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/lgbtq/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LGBTQ</a> books and expand its queer-friendly programming, including drag queen story hours. Half that money came from individual donations, and the other half came from the city government. </p>
<p>There will always be people dedicated to the cause of intolerance. But it doesn’t seem like a plausible or efficient aim to try and convert or exact revenge on each and every one of them. Let San Diego be a model: we can only move forward if we spend our time and energy and resources drowning hate with love. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-downside-of-celebrating-trumps-legal-woes/">The Downside of Celebrating Trump’s Legal Woes</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

The Canadian government would instantly capitulate to American demands, giving rise to an armed Canadian Nationalist Movement that would respond with riots and kidnappings. Thus begins the full-on invasion: “They’ll hit the big cities and knock out communications and take over, maybe shoot a few kids, and then the [Canadian Nationalist] Movement guerillas will go into the bush and start blowing up the water pipelines the Yanks will be building.” Atwood’s narrator doesn’t put much stock in this resistance force either. “The Americans wouldn’t even have to defoliate the trees,” she thinks. “The guerillas would die of starvation and exposure anyway.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, recent history has so far spared us from armed conflict with our southern neighbour. The half century since the publication of <em>Surfacing</em> has seen the bonds between Canada and the US grow stronger. On any given night, sports fans in arenas across the US stand and remove their hats for “O Canada.” Our two countries share the longest unmilitarized border in the world as well as one of the largest trade relationships ($718.4 billion in goods and services in 2019). Our national intelligence and law-enforcement agencies operate co-operatively, sharing priorities and information: when the RCMP has foiled terrorist plots in Canada, it is often thanks to a tip from the FBI. “Canadians and Americans have no better friends and partners than each other,” argues former US ambassador to Canada Bruce Heyman in a recent essay, adding, “We are bonded through history, business, sport, family and long friendship.” Former prime minister Brian Mulroney has said there are two crucial files for any Canadian PM: national unity and Canada-US relations.</p>
<p>Yet, for all of its continued economic dominance, the US often appears on the brink of anarchy. The warning signs are everywhere. In June, a man named Nicholas John Roske was arrested near the home of US Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh, carrying bags that court documents say contained pepper spray, a tactical knife, burglary tools, and a Glock pistol: a dark omen for a nation where political polarization is already running at fever pitch, with most Americans in a January 2021 poll believing that other people in the country constituted the greatest threat to their way of life. Even as ancient prejudices of race and religion have become less palatable in public life, political tribalism has acquired a serrated edge. Fifty-five percent of Republicans say Democrats are “more immoral” than other Americans, according to a 2019 report from the Pew Research Center. More than two-thirds of Republican respondents in a University of Massachusetts Amherst poll disputed president Joe Biden’s win. Yet another Pew Research Center poll, this time from 2020, found that 71 percent of single Democrats wouldn’t date a Trump voter.</p>
<p>Sky-high polarization, distrust in government, urban chaos, calcified institutions&mdash;all of it suggests an America in decline. A 2021 report from the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance added the US to a list of “backsliding democracies,” claiming that Donald Trump’s attack on the 2020 election “undermined fundamental trust in the electoral process.” Politicians like Doug Mastriano&mdash;the far-right Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate and proponent of Trump’s big lie who has likened gun-control advocates to Adolf Hitler—are on the ascent, and a raft of recent state laws are making it both harder to vote and potentially more complicated to certify votes in future elections. <em>Roe v. Wade</em> has been struck down by a Supreme Court in which five of the nine members were appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote at least once. With Biden’s approval numbers flatlining, it seems likely that Trump could reclaim the White House in 2024, should he decide to run. Republican nonchalance toward the January 6 Capitol riot suggests a nightmarish new normal: a future in which the US is no longer able to hold peaceful elections or ensure a nonviolent transition of power.</p>
<p>Canadians often regard such developments with a mixture of condescension and schadenfreude, as though our own enlightened political decisions have insulated us from American carnage. We are living in a fool’s paradise. As the authors of the May 2022 report <em>A National Security Strategy for the 2020s</em> argue, a democratically weakened and more erratic United States poses a “potentially existential question for Canada”&mdash;a situation in which our closest friend and ally “could also become a source of threat and instability.” For too long, Canada has relied on the generosity of an American “umbrella” for our national security. Now we are discovering that our umbrella is also a lightning rod, and storm clouds are brewing.</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he authors of</span> <em>A National Security Strategy for the 2020s</em> are careful to avoid apocalyptic rhetoric when discussing the United States. After all, Canada faces a plethora of familiar national-security threats, from climate change to terrorism to cyberwarfare and aggression from a revanchist Russia and a China willing to engage in hostage diplomacy with Canadian citizens. Rarely do Canadians pause to consider our national security: it doesn’t rise to the level of debate in Canadian elections, and our national-security policy has not been updated since 2004.</p>
<p>Yet, as the report makes clear, our proximity and interconnectedness with the US&mdash;which pave the way for Canadian complacency on national security&mdash;are fast becoming sources of national insecurity. If COVID-19 demonstrated our vulnerability to supply chain havoc, protests at border crossings revealed how a relatively small number of non-state actors can inflict outsized economic harm. The report cites the “ties between far-right extremists in Canada and the United States,” noting the open support the convoy protests received from not only media, including Fox News, but also conservative politicians in the US. Such meddling “may not have represented foreign interference in the conventional sense,” the report states. “But it did represent, arguably, a greater threat to Canadian democracy than the actions of any state other than the United States.”</p>
<p>More worrying is the prospect of widespread political violence within the United States. Such a prospect may have been “fanciful only a few years ago,” according to the report, “but it is very real today.” In an interview, University of Ottawa political scientist Thomas Juneau, one of the report’s directors, was clear that all-out civil war in the United States remains unlikely. Yet Juneau can foresee circumstances in the US that should keep Canadian officials awake at night: “Imagine a scenario where you have a contested election and both sides ask Canada to recognize them because they want international recognition.” The smart short-term move for Canada would be to “shut up and hope for the best.” But “whether it’s the good guys or the bad guys who end up winning, we have a neighbour who is not only extremely vulnerable domestically but also annoyed at us. That’s a <em>huge</em> problem,” Juneau warns, “one that could easily reach the scale of an existential problem for us.”</p>
<p>American political violence may also involve complicated and unpredictable spillover events in Canada. Would a right-wing populist uprising in the US inspire copycat action in Canada? Would Canada accept political refugees from the United States? If so, how would we respond if a nascent authoritarian American regime demanded their extradition? What if Canadian citizens enlisted as combatants in an intra-American armed conflict&mdash;how would a volatile American government respond to perceived incidents of Canadian-sponsored terrorism?</p>
<p>Even in the absence of armed conflict, disinformation and US-based conspiracy theories already represent a serious threat to Canadian social cohesion. According to a June poll by Abacus Data, 37 percent of Canadians now believe “there is a group of people in this country who are trying to replace native born Canadians with immigrants who agree with their political views”&mdash;otherwise known as “great replacement theory.”</p>
<p>While the prospect of open conflict between Canada and the US remains remote, Timothy Sayle, director of the international-relations program at the University of Toronto, points out that “from the historian’s perspective, the possibility of Americans or the US posing a security threat to Canada is nothing new.” Some American leaders, including Thomas Jefferson&mdash;who believed that capturing Canada would be “a mere matter of marching”&mdash;have seen Canada as ripe for the taking. In his article “Canadian National Security in Historical Perspective,” Sayle points out that “Abraham Lincoln’s secretary of state was sure the people of Canada ‘would have built “excellent states” that would surely be admitted to the union.’” In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt still held hope for the annexing of Canada. To this day, right-wing American politicians flirt with liberating Canada from what Trump called our “woke tyranny.” In February, Republican representative Lauren Boebert told Fox viewers that, while Ukraine was important, “we also have neighbours to the north who need freedom and need to be liberated.”</p>
<p>Given that the US is now our most loyal ally and security partner, Sayle’s first-year history students are often surprised to learn that Americans invaded Quebec during the Revolutionary War, that the British torched the White House in the War of 1812, and that Confederates used Canada as a base for covert operations during the US Civil War. The very creation of the Dominion of Canada was partly a response to expansionist tendencies in the US.</p>
<p>“We like to put all that in the history basket and assume it’s over,” Sayle told me. “So it seems like a surprise that the US could once again represent a national-security threat to Canada.” Of course, in each of these historical examples, Canadians could rely upon our great-power patron, the United Kingdom, for military support. In any comparable conflict between US and Canada today, we would be excruciatingly alone.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="smallcaps">anada’s intimate security</span> partnership with the United States grew partly out of Cold War&ndash;era nuclear strategy: the Americans would need to send Russia-bound nukes through Canadian airspace and depended upon our shared Distant Early Warning line in the Arctic to detect Soviet bombers coming over the pole. American nuclear warheads were deployed or stored at Goose Bay, in Labrador, and elsewhere in Canada. As the US and Canadian economies and industrial capacities grew increasingly entwined, manufacturing centres here became likely targets of Soviet nuclear attack. For better or worse, our fate was tied to that of the Americans.</p>
<p>Yet a recently declassified, top-secret 1947 memorandum by Humphrey Hume Wrong, our then ambassador to the US, reveals that Canada entered its strategic relationship with the US with eyes wide open. While generally favourable toward the Marshall Plan for the economic recovery of Europe, Wrong’s memo still lamented “the unstable and irresponsible side of the United States.” In particular, Wrong noted “a complex of forces inside the United States which threaten to promote bluster.” He pointed to the “swaggering and vicious belligerence” that had been on display in a recent <em>Washington Times Herald</em> editorial, which read, in part: “If these insults about [American] ‘imperialism’ and the like go on and on, there can come a time when our mass feeling will be: ‘Okay; if they insist on calling us Hitlers, let’s do some Hitlering’&mdash;meaning, let’s go out and kick a few of these smear artists’ store teeth down their lying throats.”</p>
<p>Wrong’s memorandum went on to warn the Canadian government of America’s “inability to comprehend the state of the European mind,” American leadership’s “plain ignorance of some elementary historical facts,” and, above all, its “blinding hatred and fear of Communism,” which “results in distortions and exaggerations which increase the difficulty of achieving a negotiated settlement.” And yet, despite all of America’s liabilities and excesses, Wrong’s memorandum fatefully concludes that “we must bear with them, for without them the rest of the world would be worse off.”</p>
<p>Recent decades have provided Canadians with ample opportunity to question the wisdom of Wrong’s conclusion. Critics of American militarism could legitimately point out that a string of foreign-policy catastrophes, from Vietnam to Central America to the Middle East&mdash;perhaps especially the government and mainstream media’s perpetuation of the “weapons of mass destruction” myth as a pretext for the invasion of Iraq&mdash;undermined the legitimacy of American institutions and hastened the process of democratic decline in ways that now imperil our national security. Canada’s overall strategic calculus remains unchanged since Wrong’s 1947 memorandum. For better or worse, our leaders have continued to affirm that “we must bear with them.”</p>
<p>Do we have a choice? History has already provided one instance of Canada switching great-power patrons, when the collapse of the British Empire and the rise of the Soviet nuclear threat prompted our alignment with the US. I asked Juneau if, in light of the current US trajectory, we could engineer a similar feat once again. “I think we should invest much more to diversify our foreign relations, our defence relations, and our national-security relations,” he said. “We should do a lot more with democracies in Asia and Europe in particular. But I absolutely don’t think that in the short to mid term, or even in the long term, we are going to be able to switch great-power patrons.”</p>
<p>“Canada has always tried to make the Canadian world bigger than North America,” Sayle told me. “But that has been successful only to a point, due to the power and proximity of the US. If we are ever to find ourselves in a position where the US is not able or not willing to defend Canada&mdash;well, then we are in a very bad place. To get to that point would mean the collapse of American power or such instability in the US government that we would have much more immediate problems.”</p>
<p>If there is little Canada can do to curtail the erosion of democracy in the US, experts agree that we have important work to do at home. <em>A National Security Strategy for the 2020s</em> urges greater institutional transparency to increase trust in government, strengthen societal resilience, and stem the tide of disinformation. Canada can also clarify its own place in the world. “We may be an extraordinarily small country in terms of quantifiable power, but that doesn’t mean we should sit by and watch the world fall apart around us,” Sayle says. “We need to decide what is important about Canada. What do we want to preserve? What do we stand for? It’s important to look elsewhere, but we must look inward as well.”</p>
<p>Fear mongering and catastrophizing will get us nowhere. We are still some distance from the Yanks sending in the Marines, and a Canadian nationalist guerrilla movement remains the stuff of our national literary imagination. In the short term, Juneau emphasizes, “our relationship with the US remains, by and large, beneficial. But we do need to think about the worst-case scenarios,” he warns. “They are not 0 percent probabilities anymore.”</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/how-an-unstable-us-threatens-canadas-national-security/">How an Unstable US Threatens Canada’s National Security</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

These and other perks are an extension of a broader commitment American political culture has toward presidential deference&mdash;a long-held tradition that is worth questioning, especially now.</p>
<p>While there are many examples of presidential legislative power, including the ability to veto Congress, issue executive orders and pardons, or withhold information from Congress, deference is a subtler thing, rooted in ritual and ceremony. It’s the respect, esteem, and ingratiation granted to the office of the presidency and, by extension, to the men who have occupied it. As <em>The Nation</em> columnist Jeet Heer pointed out to me, it’s why presidents receive military salutes and issue honours. It&#8217;s the pomp and grandeur of the State of the Union address, to which the president arrives by motorcade before the sergeant-at-arms announces his arrival to Congress. It is, in other words, comparable to many tributes other countries, Canada among them, reserve for monarchs and their representatives. And, for many presidents, it lasts well beyond their terms in office: some enjoy deference for life.</p>
<p>Although Donald Trump liked to claim that no president had ever been treated worse than him, he, too, enjoyed presidential deference throughout his four years in office. Despite Trump referring to the press as the enemy of the people, commenting on where former Fox News host Megyn Kelly did or did not bleed from, and banning CNN’s Jim Acosta from the White House after calling him a “rude, terrible person,” for much of Trump’s presidency, many journalists tried to treat him as they would any other president, such as by providing platforms for his side of political arguments even when that side advanced disinformation and hate speech.</p>

</ul>
<p>As legendary CNN anchor and correspondent Christiane Amanpour predicted in 2016, journalism faced an “existential crisis” during the Trump era. Caught off guard, the press seemed to take a few years to find a way to fact-check Trump’s comments in real time and cover his presidency without helping spread his lies. Meanwhile, in the final months and weeks of his administration, and particularly in the fallout from the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, social and mainstream media started to do what many had hoped for: deplatform the president. This included major networks cutting away from Trump’s press conferences and Twitter and Facebook kicking the president off of their sites, though whether Trump will be banned from Facebook permanently is under review by the company’s oversight board. These weren’t insignificant steps, but after more than four years and with just weeks left of Trump’s administration, some pundits proclaimed they were “too little, too late.”</p>
<p>It’s tempting to think that the problem of how to deal with a president as unorthodox as Donald Trump has been solved now that he no longer holds office. But, as an ex-president, Trump joins an elite club of living former presidents: Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. And, unless the US breaks with political norms, Trump will continue to receive at least some of the deferential treatment granted to former presidents, all in the name of respecting the office he held, upholding tradition, and even, some may argue, helping to unite a deeply divided country. The question is whether a man who spent years flouting political norms ought to be worthy of this one.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">fter the American Revolution</span>, the political system that emerged in the wake of George Washington’s presidency planted the roots of much of what the US must work with today. For many Americans, Washington set an example of how to be both a virtuous president and a virtuous American, and his presidency set a precedent that the head of state ought to be a role model, someone to look up to. Without a monarchy, the union of diverse states needed something to hold its federal system together. If it wasn’t going to be a monarch (as in Canada), America’s founders decided it would be the Constitution and the man elected to uphold and protect it. “When the American system works&mdash;which isn’t always&mdash;the president is a unifying figure in the same way a monarchy is supposed to be: someone who embodies the nation as whole, not just the party they belong to,” Jeet Heer told me.</p>

<p>This unifying role would, in some cases, extend beyond the presidency. Upon Washington’s death, in December 1799, two years after he left office, eulogists thanked providence for bestowing Washington on “mankind, to instruct them both how to live and how to die,” and for opening “to our children a volume so pure and instructive, as THE LIFE OF WASHINGTON!” Nearly fifty years later, construction started on the Washington Monument, which would become a symbol of the national capital. According to Lindsay Chervinsky, a presidential historian and the author of <em>The Cabinet: George Washington and the Creation of an American Institution</em>, not all former presidents received such tributes. In the country’s early years, Americans tended to elevate only those who left an extraordinary legacy of public service: Washington for having fought the British, Thomas Jefferson for having written the Declaration of Independence. No one gave Washington’s successor, John Adams, the same postpresidency treatment, and several nineteenth-century presidents&mdash;Benjamin Harrison, Grover Cleveland, and Chester Arthur among them&mdash;occupied a quieter life after they left office.</p>
<p>The Former Presidents Act, passed in 1958, during Dwight D. Eisenhower’s presidency, marks the emergence of a more robust support system for ex-presidents. Although Harry S. Truman, who had left office five years prior, was financially comfortable, both he and former president Herbert Hoover supported the act, which gives ex-presidents a pension as well as financial reimbursement for office space and staff. Legislators created the act in part to “maintain the dignity” of the presidency and to preserve the welfare and well-being of ex-presidents. Sam Rushay, supervisory archivist at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum, says Truman accepted his pension, though he opposed any notion that one may profit from the &#8220;prestige and dignity of the office of the presidency” and made it a policy not to accept any speaking fees unless they went toward his presidential library and museum. (Hoover, who in his prepresidential life had been a wealthy businessman, donated his pension to charity.) It&#8217;s worth remembering that these were the days before former presidents racked up speaking fees in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>To Chervinsky, the kind of deference afforded to past presidents today&mdash;“the presidents’ club, Secret Service protection, treating them very much with kid gloves”&mdash;is likely linked with the rise of mass media in the twentieth century, which could track former presidents’ movements more easily, as well as with the fact that most former presidents now live longer. (By the same token, Chervinsky notes, some benefits, such as Secret Service protection, are often warranted.) The Secret Service assumed full responsibility for the presidents’ protection in the early twentieth century, but its surveillance of the president, his family, and the White House grew significantly during the Second World War. In 1965, Congress granted former presidents Secret Service protection for life, though these benefits were scaled back in 1994 as a cost-cutting measure. “I think we have seen that being a former president can be a pretty lucrative career,” one representative said in support of the cuts. But, in 2013, the Obama administration reinstated lifetime protection for ex-presidents and their spouses, a perk that&#8217;s believed to cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars a year, per president.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t’s hard</span> to find a president who is comparable to Trump, though Richard Nixon may come close. So, when thinking about how Trump will be treated postpresidency, I was curious about the only president who has ever resigned from office. In his postpresidential life, Nixon quickly found himself pardoned by president Gerald Ford, in 1974, before charges had even been brought against him. Speaking on <em>The Mehdi Hasan Show</em> last November, Kevin Kruse, a historian at Princeton University and co-author of <em>Fault Lines: A History of the United States since 1974</em>, said that Nixon’s pardon “didn’t heal the nation, it only aggravated the sense that Nixon had escaped justice.” Kruse added that the pardon “emboldened Nixon,” and he pointed to the former president’s famous 1977 interview with British broadcaster David Frost, in which Nixon famously declared, “Well, when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.”</p>
<p>Despite resigning from the job over the Watergate scandal, Nixon maintained some perks of postpresidential life in addition to his pardon. In 1990, his presidential library and museum opened in Yorba Linda, California, Nixon’s birthplace, with a ceremony featuring then president George H. W. Bush and former presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. Chervinsky stresses that, among politicians in particular, there was “internal deference” when it came to Nixon. “Even though Nixon was sort of <em>persona non grata</em> publicly, he helped a lot of presidents after he left office, especially on foreign policy. They would call him and ask for his advice.” Indeed, it was then president Bill Clinton who helped to rehabilitate Nixon’s posthumous public image. The two became unlikely friends, and Clinton delivered the eulogy at Nixon’s 1994 funeral, which could have been a state one had his family not opted for a smaller service at the Nixon library. Perhaps fortuitously for a president who would later be impeached, Clinton called for “the day of judging President Nixon on anything less than his entire life and career” to “come to a close.”</p>
<p>A rare refusal, then and now, to entertain the notion that even dead presidents deserve deference came from gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson. In his obituary to Nixon, published in <em>Rolling Stone</em>, Thompson wrote, among many other things: “If the right people had been in charge of Nixon&#8217;s funeral, his casket would have been launched into one of those open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles.” Too much? Thompson didn’t think so. “Some people will say that words like <em>scum</em> and <em>rotten</em> are wrong for Objective Journalism&mdash;which is true, but they miss the point. It was the built-in blind spots of the Objective rules and dogma that allowed Nixon to slither into the White House in the first place.” Nixon, he closed, “has poisoned our water forever.”</p>
<p>Keep in mind what Nixon had been accused of: covering up a break-in at the Democratic National Committee’s headquarters. Keep in mind what Trump has been accused of: colluding with a foreign power to interfere in American elections and inciting an insurrection against the US Capitol. Maybe, in an era of fake news and disinformation, one in which presidential deference persists, the only kind of journalism capable of capturing the spirit of the Trump administration will have to be gonzo in nature. “You had to get Subjective to see Nixon clearly,” Thompson noted. The same may prove true for any future Trumpian candidates.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">lthough Trump</span> will go down in history as the first president to be impeached twice, his acquittal in the Senate, fuelled by Republicans’ willingness to maintain a public allegiance to him, means that the prospect of holding Trump accountable will fall to other branches of government. There are still, for instance, ongoing investigations in Georgia, for Trump’s efforts to overturn the state’s election results, and New York, for his family business’s dealings. But, unless reforms are put in place, Congress’s willingness to overlook Trump’s many infractions will no doubt help to, as Chervinsky put it, pave the way for abuse of power by “frankly smarter actors.” Meanwhile, speaking on the <em>The Mehdi Hasan Show</em>, Kruse suggested that the refusal to apply the law to the president “only encourages lawlessness by future chief executives and the people who work for them.” </p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that Trump shows no signs of retiring into a quiet postpresidential life. Not when some 74 million Americans voted for him and, according to a poll last December, 62 percent of Republicans say it’s “very likely” that the Democrats stole the election. Financially speaking, Trump doesn’t need the perks afforded to former presidents (neither do any living ex-presidents, for that matter), and he will manage to wreak havoc on the country with or without them. But denying Trump the reverence and respect bestowed on former presidents&mdash;the invitations to ceremonies, for instance, or a pension worth more than three times the average American household income&mdash;may be the only recourse Americans have for holding Trump accountable and for sending an important message about what they will and will not tolerate from their leaders, past, present, and future.</p>
<p>Biden has already started to do this, saying in early February that Trump should not receive the customary intelligence briefings granted to former presidents, though that decision ultimately rests with his national security team. But, as we enter these post-Trump years, I’m reminded of an analogy American writer George Saunders made in an April 2020 story for <em>The New Yorker</em>, called “Love Letter.” In the story, a grandfather is writing a letter to his grandson in the near future, a future when Trump has maintained his iron-clad grip on the country and his son has won a “sham election,” though the Trumps are never named. “If you’ll allow me a crude metaphor&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;” the grandfather writes. “A guy comes into a dinner party, takes a dump on the rug in the living room. The guests get all excited, yell in protest. He takes a second dump. The guests feel, Well, yelling didn’t help. (While some of them applaud his audacity.) He takes a third dump, on the table, and still no one throws him out. At that point, the sky has become the limit in terms of future dumps.”</p>
<p>The question many Americans&mdash;not to mention foreign dignitaries, members of the press, and social media CEOs&mdash;have to ask themselves is this: Once you’ve managed to actually throw this guy out and have started to clean up his mess, do you still invite him to your garden party several months later? Doing so sets a new precedent for what you’re willing to tolerate. Not doing so risks pissing off the people who managed to actually like the guy. Neither option is good: both are dangerous, but one is disastrous.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/what-perks-does-a-twice-impeached-president-deserve/">What Perks Does a Twice-Impeached President Deserve?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p><span class="dropcap">I&#8217;</span><span class="smallcaps">m seven years old,</span> and under my bed is a go bag for when I head over the wall. Inside the green plastic garbage bag are a few stuffed animals that I take out every night and return each morning. A fraying rabbit, Winnie-the-Pooh, a Rin Tin Tin dog. It’s not always the same three that make it into the go bag. I line up all my stuffed animals and decide which I can take with me. My older sister watches but never says a word. She knows there is no way out, but I still see potential openings. Our tall bedroom window looks out onto the back porch and has a ­wooden screen that can be removed only from the outside. When no one is watching, I sneak around to the porch and loosen as many swivel clips as I can reach. At the grocery store, I wander off from my mother and six older siblings and try to look like a child who needs rescuing, like I wouldn’t make a sound if someone snatched me away. </p>
<p>Nobody takes the bait. It will be fifty years before I make it over the wall on my own. </p>

<p>It was 1968 and I was stranded deep in the wilds of New York’s Westchester County with my parents, five brothers, sister, and 250 boys who had been sent to Lincoln Hall by the state to be rehabilitated for their petty crimes and truancy. Lincoln Hall was well camouflaged. Its expansive property was bisected by Route 202, a highway bounded by old stone walls that meandered through the southern tip of New York state and across the Hudson River. The Lincoln Hall campus ­encompassed a new chapel, a gymnasium with gleaming hardwood, an outdoor quarter-mile running track, a manicured baseball diamond, a swimming pool, handball courts, and a movie theatre. The entire property, on both sides of Route 202, was surrounded by acres of farmland.</p>
<p>Lincoln Hall was run by the De La Salle Christian Brothers with a handful of lay staff. Our family of nine had moved out of the Bronx two years earlier. Our parents, Ed and Pat, sold the brothers on a package deal&mdash;my mother, Pat, would be the school’s librarian, and Ed the new assistant vice-­principal. Neither had the formal requirements for their jobs. Pat told anyone who asked that she was inspired by the Hollywood blockbuster Boys Town, starring Spencer Tracy as the real-life Father Flanagan. Ed looked the part of a man who could keep troubled youth in line, with his regulation Navy crewcut and the American bald eagle on his forearm. When we first arrived, Ed called Lincoln Hall a “country club for delinquents.” His office was on the main floor of the Fishbowl, an L-shaped red-brick building with wide glass double-doors framed by a semicircular portico. Near Ed’s office were the locked cells for the boys who acted up or tried to run away. When a Linky kid jumped the wall, it was Ed’s job to fetch him back and drop him in the cells for a few days.</p>

</div></div>
</div>
<p>Pat had negotiated our housing on Lincoln Hall property as part of the package deal. We lived on the ground floor of what was then the Lakeview, a 100-year-old house without lake or view. Ed sunk a pole into the front lawn and raised the American flag every morning. Every night, he picked two of his children to lower the flag and fold it into tight military triangles. On Sunday nights, Ed ironed his five white work shirts, then polished both his pairs of black penny loafers and both his pairs of brown penny loafers, in that order. </p>

<p>Life at the Lakeview was a roulette of transgressions. It ­always started the same way. Ed and Pat lined the seven of us up in the kitchen in age order. Ed promised nobody would get hit if we told him the truth. He wanted to know who broke into the locked fridge, who stuck gum on the dog, who left the car window open, who ate his pistachios, moved one of his razor blades, busted the couch, put a hole in the screen door, or drank the Vicks cough syrup. Sometimes there was no transgression at all. </p>
<p>Ed began at one end of the line and worked his way down to me. “Was it you?” Each <em>No</em> bought you a crack across the side of your head, clipping your ear with his Knights of Columbus ring. My oldest brother’s hands would fly up to cover his inflamed face, a scalded combination of fear and confusion. When my brother cried, Ed sneered, “Why are you crying? Tell me why you’re crying.” </p>
<p>Ed was a lefty but swung right with my second oldest ­brother, the only redhead in the lot, born with a misshapen ear and a birthmark on the side of his head. The ear was off limits. That was Pat’s rule. Pat liked to tell the story that she had seen her husband cry only twice: the first time he saw his son’s birthmark and when JFK was assassinated. Down the line, my brother with the bullet-shaped head, the beefiest of all the boys, would jut his jaw out to enrage Ed even more. It always worked. </p>
<div class="su-animate" style="opacity:0;-webkit-animation-duration:1s;-webkit-animation-delay:0s;animation-duration:1s;animation-delay:0s;" data-animation="fadeIn" data-duration="1" data-delay="0"><figure id="attachment_127808" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-127808" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Rogan_USCanada_1080_liberty.jpg" alt="" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-within"/><figcaption id="caption-attachment-127808" class="wp-caption-text">Liberty Fading, Winona, Mississippi (1998)</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Once, the middle brother, with sanguine hazel eyes the size of half dollars, jumped the gun and confessed just to get it all over with. It didn’t work. “You think I’m a fool?” My sister stared at the ground, shoulders rounded, plucking at the ends of her too-short shirt sleeves and hiccupping from fear and tears. “I bet you feel sorry for yourself.” I could feel our collective rage gather and dissolve with each pass up and down the line.</p>
<p>Ed talked a lot when he beat his kids. He liked to lean in close, looking at your forehead instead of your eyes. With spittle at the corners of his mouth, he would remind you that you had no problems. “You think you have problems? You don’t know what a problem is. I’ve got real problems. You’ve got it made.”</p>
<p>After making his way up and down the line a few times with no result, Ed would turn to Pat and begin their canned exchange. What followed was part Beckett, part vaudeville. </p>
<p>“How did this happen to us, Pat? How did we get saddled with seven lying sacks of shit?” Pat would sigh and cock her head to one side, resigned, heartbroken. “To have to raise savages. A pack of animals. Thieves. Did we miss something? The roof over their heads, the food on their plates&mdash;Isn’t it enough?”</p>
<p>When they’d run through their script, Ed would pull out the big guns. It was the final, violent punctuation of the battering. Vile slurs we knew were wrong&mdash;vile even for the time we lived in. “I go to work every day and have to deal with n&#8212;ers and s&#8211;cs. Do you think I want to work with those animals? Do you think your mother wants to work with n&#8212;ers and s&#8211;cs and then come home to this? You kids? Seven lying sacks of shit?” </p>
<p>Ed and Pat would take a well-timed smoke break so we could spin a butter knife on the kitchen table to choose a victim. We watched the beating that came next. Afterward, with scarlet faces and ears ringing, we were piled into the car for King Kone ice cream, careful not to drop a sprinkle on Ed’s car seats.</p>
<p class="pull-quote">At home, my family was a cauldron of threats and violence. Outside, America was seething. </p>
<p>If Ed was methodical in his violence, Pat was chaotic, hijacked by despair. She brandished a shotgun at her children. She grabbed knives from the kitchen and accused us of wanting her dead. She tore through the house at odd hours, cursing the man who had stuffed her full of babies and ruined her life. She would leave the house in her nightgown with an empty suitcase to sit at the end of the long gravel driveway, waiting for one of the boys to coax her back inside. Ed always played possum, asleep in his La-Z-Boy, until she spun herself out.</p>
<p>We were told, “What happens in this house stays in this house.” They needn’t have worried. At six, I stopped speaking for a while. I couldn’t drag a single word out of my mouth. I was terrified Ed and Pat were going to hell. I prayed for my parents and did my best to sound sincere. I worried that I couldn’t be a good person in a family like this and that maybe we’d all go to hell together. At St. Joseph elementary school, we stood with our hands over our hearts, ­facing the American flag, and recited the Pledge of Allegiance every morning. The nuns told us how to be good: carry orange UNICEF boxes at Halloween, pray for African babies, keep our hands and feet to ourselves, keep our mouths zipped in the hallways, and most of all, never lie.</p>
<p>The first lie I ever told myself was that I couldn’t run away from home because I loved my family. I told myself that my brothers and sister would never survive without me, that I mattered to them. I ran sentences in my head, practised lies to defend against the futility of my useless go bag. I told myself that I loved my father, and that I loved my mother, even when they beat me.</p>
<p>I did love my family, but that wasn’t why I stayed. A seven-year-old has nowhere to go.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smallcaps">n October 25, 2018,</span> after more than three decades living and working in Canada, I walked into the American embassy in Ottawa and renounced my American citizenship. As instructed by my lawyer and embassy officials, I carried only a slim valise. Inside were a fistful of US government forms, my American passport for surrender, my American birth certificate, my Social Security card, and my Canadian passport to prove I would not be stateless after my renunciation. The valise also held a self-addressed express-post envelope, to receive my Certificate of Loss of Nationality once the US State Department had stamped its final approval, and a cashier’s cheque for $2,350 (US)&mdash;my exit fee.  </p>
<p>My formal renunciation was the final step in a byzantine two-year journey that began when I applied to become a Canadian citizen a few months before the 2016 US presidential election. My creeping fear had evolved into grim certainty that Donald Trump would win. I was desperate to shed all birthright ties to my country.</p>
<p>Until the 2016 election, I’d always thought of my childhood as an outlier, so extreme that I couldn’t shoehorn it into a larger narrative. It wasn’t until Trump’s transgressive campaign&mdash;the ominous stalking of Hillary Clinton on a debate stage, the grotesque pantomime of a disabled reporter and fusillade of racist statements at his rallies&mdash;that I recognized my family as a diorama of America’s dysfunction. As I watched Trump lie in real time, disavowing reality while inciting violence, I realized that my family shared the same superpower: we could hide in plain sight, lie to ourselves, and make others believe it. And, just as Trump would disproportionately attack anyone who threatened to unmask him, we would go to any lengths to protect our lies.</p>
<p>Once, I walked into the kitchen just as Pat whipped her Bloody Mary at Ed’s head. She missed, and the tumbler exploded against the wall behind him. I was certain she had shot him. One of my brothers tried to comfort me and said this kind of thing happened in all families. I knew that wasn’t true. When Ed and Pat stopped eating meals with us and instead brought their plates of better food and pitchers of cold Tom Collins into the living room each night, I knew that that wasn’t normal either.</p>
<p>When Ed and Pat trotted us out in public, people would marvel at their outsize brood and how well behaved we were, how scrubbed clean we looked in Pat’s handmade clothing. They couldn’t hear Ed’s <em>sotto voce</em> in our ears, his breath on the backs of our necks as he’d lean over with a smile on his face if anyone was acting up and warn, “Fuck with me now and you’re fucking with your heartbeat,” or, “I’m going to lose my shoe up your ass when we get home,” or, “I’m going to knock you into the middle of next week.”</p>
<p>At home, my family was a cauldron of threats and violence. Outside of the Lakeview, America was seething. Early in 1968, South Carolina Highway Patrol officers fired into a crowd of student protesters at South Carolina State University, a historically Black school in Orangeburg. Three Black students were shot dead. In April of that year, Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination ignited widespread rioting that escalated ­into shoot-to-kill orders. Antiwar demonstrations on college campuses spread across the country even as the US increased troop deployment in Vietnam. The Democratic National Convention in ­Chicago turned into a televised brawl. Richard Nixon ran on a “law and order” campaign that won him the 1968 presidential election, then dog-whistled about the rise of Afrocentrism and the Black Panther Party. </p>

<p>In 1972, right before his second term, Nixon’s White House was under investigation for a break-in and phone-tapping at the Democratic National Committee head­quarters, in the Watergate complex. Beginning on May 18, 1973, the Watergate hearings aired live on all three major US networks. I was ­eleven years old and glued to the TV along with tens of millions of Americans who watched live or stayed up half the night to catch the rebroadcasts on public television.</p>
<p>When the Watergate hearings ended, in August, Ed had already lost or quit his job after seven years at Lincoln Hall (he never said which), and we moved to Connecticut. We bounced from one rental to another while Ed commuted back to Westchester to teach grade seven at Somers Middle School. The job came with a pay cut and a sixty-four kilometre daily round trip in the middle of America’s crushing recession and national gas shortage. In Connecticut, Pat wallpapered and sewed drapes for wealthy homeowners in Newtown, Bethel, Brookfield, and Darien.</p>
<p>At the end of our first year in Connecticut, Nixon resigned to avoid his inevitable impeachment. Vice-president Gerald Ford was sworn in as president, promising Americans that their “long national nightmare was over.” A month later, he pardoned Nixon. President Ford’s message was clear: Nixon was just a bad dream; the greatest country in the world doesn’t have paranoid presidents who order criminal acts and keep enemy lists.</p>
<p>In 1975, I started high school. My parents bought a house on Washington Avenue in Danbury with the student loans of their older children. Danbury was a small city surrounded by ­prettier towns, a dreary place pocked with abandoned hat factories. If you bought a hat in the early decades of the twentieth century, it was likely made in “Hat City” by European immigrants. But the industry was already in decline: by the early 1950s, when headgear began to go out of fashion, ­Danbury was washed up.</p>
<p>After buying their new home, Ed and Pat’s first act of community involvement was to sign a petition to bar a Black family from buying the house next door. Black families were ­largely confined to the public housing projects on Eden Drive and ­Laurel Gardens. Throughout the 1970s, race riots were a regular occurrence at Danbury High School, violent brawls that landed at least one student in the hospital. In 1979, ­fifteen years after the Civil Rights Act was passed, a member of the KKK was distributing pamphlets on the local state university campus. </p>
<p>I got a job as a cashier at the Danbury A&#038;P just as Ronald Reagan resurrected the ugly myth of the welfare queen in his unsuccessful presidential run of 1976. Black families who arrived at the store with food stamps and WIC vouchers were greeted by security at the front and in the aisles. Deli cold cuts were wrapped and labelled in sets: one of three, two of three. Cashiers were told to check under Black toddlers sitting in shopping carts if three of three was missing.</p>
<p class="pull-quote">I promised myself that there would be a day when I would tell the truth. I could be a good person. </p>
<p>By the time I hit my teens, I hadn’t prayed for my parents in years. I did, however, agonize that my own moral compass was in jeopardy. Deceit&mdash;about where I was going, whom I was seeing&mdash;was required every time I wanted to leave the house. Pat insisted that my friends were laughing at me behind my back, that they were not to be trusted. Late at night, I would roll the lies I’d told over in my head like worry beads. I promised myself that there would be a day when I would tell the truth. I could be a good person.</p>
<p>By 1980, Reagan was elected president and the house in Danbury turned out to be a lemon. The back half was below ground level and flooded on schedule. Mushrooms sprouted in the rust-coloured shag carpet, and our family was keeping pace with the decomposition. My second and third oldest brothers were both married and divorced before they hit their late twenties. My eldest brother never returned home after attending university in Nova Scotia. My middle brother had a psychotic break and landed in the locked psych ward at Danbury Hospital. My brother’s doctor recommended that Ed and Pat participate in his treatment and attend family ­therapy. They wouldn’t risk being exposed if details about our childhoods emerged, so my brother was left on his own for three weeks at the hospital. The seven of us scrambled away from one another. In 1981, when I left to attend university in ­Toronto, ­only two of my siblings remained at home.</p>
<p>A few years later, it was just Pat and Ed on Washington ­Avenue. They opted for a second chapter. In 1984, they came to Canada and soared through the immigration process on the wings of a recently passed bill to extend funding to Catholic schools in Ontario. They rented an apartment in North York and were promptly hired by the Toronto Separate School Board (today the Toronto Catholic District School Board) as special education teachers. Pat taught the primary grades in downtown Toronto and Ed taught at a high school just around the corner from their apartment building.</p>
<p>Ed delighted in being the brash American with the Bronx accent and badass tattoo. His students loved him. Among the stories he liked to tell was the time he stood on his desk in a toga to teach Julius Caesar, and how he had coached the baseball team wearing the Yankee pinstripes. Ed asked his students to help him out when school board evaluators came around during his probation period. He would ask the class a question, and every student would raise a hand. A right hand signalled that they knew the answer; a left hand would never be called on. One hundred percent participation with an astounding success rate.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smallcaps">eing an American</span> in Canada was a lot easier than being one in America. I picked the best version of the American mythos and stuck with that until I couldn’t. I was breezy, opinionated, and confident. In my work life and with friends, I presented my Irish American family as a ­sprawling, grittier version of the Kennedys playing touch football on the front lawn&mdash;only our version included parents who didn’t take us to the hospital when we ended up with broken bones. The best lies are rooted in parallel truths.</p>
<p>I didn’t stay in touch with anyone from the States outside of a few family members. And, even though they had relocated to Toronto, I didn’t see much of Ed and Pat either. Instead, I settled into my Canadian life. After university, I became a landed immigrant. By the late 1980s, my work as a producer for the CBC took me to Alberta, Quebec, and Ottawa. My magazine ­writing took me to Saskatoon and to First Nations communities in Labrador. After my son was born, in 1991, I knew I would never live in the United States again. I couldn’t imagine uprooting him&mdash;or myself, for that matter. Still, I never considered renouncing my American citizenship or formally becoming a Canadian. Occasionally, a friend would ask why, and I never had a good answer.</p>
<p>I didn’t spend any significant time in the US again until the summer of 2001, when <em>Esquire</em> sent me to Florida to write about Nathaniel Brazill, a fourteen-year-old Black boy being tried as an adult for the fatal shooting of his white seventh-­grade ­teacher, Barry Grunow. On the morning of May 26, 2000, ­Brazill had been suspended for throwing water balloons. He was sent home and returned with a handgun he had found at his grandfather’s house. Brazill later told police he had just wanted to say goodbye to two girls before the school year ended. When Grunow wouldn’t let him into the classroom, Brazill took the gun out to scare his teacher. As Brazill later told police, he didn’t know what had happened after the gun went off. “Well, like, I couldn’t see ’cause my eyes started to get real watery and stuff, so I just ran. After I seen the blood, I ran.”</p>
<p>Brazill spent the next year awaiting trial in the Palm Beach County jail. Through the Plexiglas, I could see a whisper of hair over his top lip. He had also filled out: he was four inches taller and twenty pounds heavier. His defence attorney knew what this meant. Brazill had gone from being a boy to a “thug.” His story was going to end only one way. </p>
<p>Brazill was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to twenty-eight years in prison, where he remains ­today. His story was in the queue for publication when the Twin Towers fell. Esquire held the piece. It wasn’t the right time. The right time never came.  </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">fter Nathaniel Brazill</span> and 9/11,  the distance between myself and America cracked open. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, I bought an American flag and hung it on my front porch in Toronto. It was a strange impulse, a phantom-limb spasm of patriotism that I thought had been properly excised. It was also an echo of my childhood attempts at prayer, an obligation to feel what others felt.</p>
<p>Whatever cell memory made me hang the American flag quickly fizzled. I didn’t hang the flag on the one-year ­anniversary of 9/11 or any year after that. What followed for America was the steady erosion of its meticulously crafted image on the world stage. A bad-faith pursuit of non­existent weapons of mass destruction led to the disastrous foray ­into Iraq. At home, the Patriot Act and Homeland Security expanded the government’s surveillance powers. Police departments were militarized with equipment off-loaded from the US Army&mdash;equipment used in full force today. When Americans took to their streets last spring to protest the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, they were greeted by police officers straight out of <em>Call of Duty</em>: bulky monochromatic uniforms, body armour, tactical vests, flak jackets, helmets, visors, and semiautomatic assault rifles at the ready. </p>
<p>When I joined Facebook, in 2010, a window into the America I’d left behind opened with friend requests from my Immaculate High School class of 1979. Dozens of my Catholic schoolmates now identified as conservative evangelical Christians. I remember being unsettled by the vociferous religiosity that cluttered my Facebook feed: ­prayer chains, personal testimonies about God’s love, and anti-­abortion rhetoric. The burgeoning Canadian in me noticed that almost every American political speech ended with the command <em>God bless America</em>. By 2015, the conspiracy theories about ­Barack Obama’s US citizenship had turned into misogynistic attacks on Hillary Clinton. My New ­Jersey cousins were vocal Trump supporters. By the summer of 2016, I’d worn out the unfriend button, and my application for ­Canadian ­citizenship was in the queue.</p>
<p class="pull-quote">For people mortified by Trump’s victory, those years were a psychic grinding of gears. </p>
<p>Trump’s victory, on the evening of November 8, 2016, was a flash-bang grenade. When the country’s senses came back, president-elect Donald Trump was lumbering across the stage with his family in tow. Clinton was the winner of the popular vote, with almost 66 million votes, but it didn’t ­matter. Trump’s gleefully nihilistic campaign had earned him almost 63 million votes. He’d promised a border wall, maligned Mexicans, advocated a Muslim ban, stoked violence against protestors at his rallies, threatened to jail Clinton, and bragged about ­sexually assaulting women. I was on the phone through much of the night and into the early morning with my middle brother in Connecticut. He’d been reassuring me for weeks that Trump didn’t have a hope in hell; Clinton would mop the floor with him.</p>
<p>When Trump won, my brother said he’d be impeached within a year. He wasn’t alone in this belief. The day after Trump’s inauguration, the Women’s March drew millions of protestors in cities across the country. Similar protests continued for the next two years. It seemed that many Americans could not reconcile Trump’s ascendance with their ideas about America. The dissonance was profound.</p>
<p>On February 22, 2017, about a month after Trump’s inauguration, I took my oath of Canadian citizenship along with ­dozens of others at Scarborough Town Centre. It was standing room only, with friends and family members of the soon-to-be new Canadians crowded together along the back and side walls, holding tiny Canadian flags. The excitement was infectious, and almost immediately, I was caught off guard by how emotional I felt. What had begun as a calculated off-ramp to unload my American citizenship had deepened into something else when I wasn’t looking. The presiding judge kept things short and sweet. She congratulated us and suggested we get to know our neighbours, make new friends, and visit Canada’s provincial parks.</p>
<p>And so it was as a Canadian that I watched the midterm elections in November 2018 and watched Trump roll back Obamacare and withdraw from the Paris Agreement. It was as a Canadian that I watched him hand out tax boons for the rich, withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, put children in cages at the southern ­border, embolden violent white supremacists in Charlottesville, attack the press, shelter US enemies, and alienate allies.</p>
<p>While Trump napalmed the sociopolitical landscape, the mainstream media&mdash;CNN, the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Washington Post</em>&mdash;paddled in circles, wilfully pretending, perhaps even believing, that Trump would transform into something more presidential&mdash;that he’d stop slandering his opponents, colluding with Russians, or egging on white supremacists. He never did.</p>
<p>For people mortified by Trump’s victory, these years were a psychic grinding of gears. Seeing but not believing. Predicting nonexistent tipping points&mdash;“This is not who we are”&mdash;and waiting for the country to be rescued by a rotating cast of heroes who never showed up: James Comey, Robert ­Mueller, John ­Kelly, James Mattis, Susan Collins, any honourable Republican. It was a cruel political Ferberizing. But I wasn’t ­surprised. I was watching my childhood, writ large.</p>
<div class="su-animate" style="opacity:0;-webkit-animation-duration:1s;-webkit-animation-delay:0s;animation-duration:1s;animation-delay:0s;" data-animation="fadeIn" data-duration="1" data-delay="0"><figure id="attachment_127808" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-127808" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Rogan_USCanada_1080_streetart.jpg" alt="" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-within"/><figcaption id="caption-attachment-127808" class="wp-caption-text">Gun, Hand on Neck, Cuffed Boy, New York City (2002)</figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smallcaps">ith my Canadian</span> citizenship in hand, I hired a lawyer at the end of May 2018 and slogged on with the bureaucratic waterboarding of renouncing my US citizenship. I struggled to remember exact dates and the ­addresses of where I had lived and worked in the United States almost four ­decades ago. I was unnerved by sinister warnings about the repercussions of lying or trying to evade taxes. They demanded the highest balance in every one of my bank accounts over the past five years (Form 114a) to screen for possible money laundering. I had to provide the name and credentials of my lawyer (Form G-28). I had to fill out a Non-­Resident Alien Income Tax Return for each of the past five years (Form 1040NR). With each completed form, I revealed more of myself to the American government.</p>
<p>To complete my formal renunciation, I was instructed to appear at the American embassy in Ottawa on October 25, 2018, at 1 p.m.&mdash;six months after I began the process. The embassy looks like an above-ground bunker, ­rising at an ­illusory slant and bulwarked by concrete barriers, a ­modern-­day portcullis to prevent anybody from driving in. Cameras are ­mounted like ­turrets. The interior is muted in comparison. I was ­greeted outside the front door by a guard who waved a security wand over me. Inside, a second guard checked my valise and pointed me down the hall, to the cashier’s ­wicket, to hand over my bank draft. After a short wait, vice-­counsel Angela M. Mora went through my personal documents and government paperwork sheet by sheet. She then had me read and sign form DS-4081, Statement of Understanding Concerning the Consequences and Ramifications of Renunciation or Relinquishment of US Nationality. The statement reiterated warnings about tax evasion, ­becoming an alien, and America’s power to ­extradite me back for a criminal offence.</p>
<p>Finally, the question I’d been warned about by my ­lawyer and by other expats who had already renounced: “Why are you choosing to renounce your citizenship today?” I had been given straightforward instructions for this exact question. I was to make it clear that I had no plans to ever work or live in the United States again and I no longer wanted to keep my citizenship. Instead, I prattled on about how I had come to love Canada. I blurted out that I didn’t hate America and I might even feel sad about giving up my citizenship, but my life was in Canada now. </p>
<p>I was seven years old again, trying to convince myself that I loved the country I was escaping. Vice-counsel Mora looked relieved when I stopped talking. She stamped the final sheet of paper before confiscating my passport.</p>
<p>I renounced my American citizenship so I could stop lying, about my family and about America. The cherry-picked ­mythos of my American childhood that I’d imported with me to Canada didn’t hold up over time. It didn’t hold up with my siblings either. A brutish childhood is a burdensome thing to have in common. One of my brothers tells people his whole family died in a tragic plane crash. I appreciate the economy of his solution. Another brother simply disappeared. My family fled to three different countries and two continents. The shortest distance between any two of us was a five-hour drive we never made.</p>
<div class="su-animate" style="opacity:0;-webkit-animation-duration:1s;-webkit-animation-delay:0s;animation-duration:1s;animation-delay:0s;" data-animation="fadeIn" data-duration="1" data-delay="0"><figure id="attachment_127808" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-127808" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Rogan_USCanada_1080_bluesky.jpg" alt="" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-within"/><figcaption id="caption-attachment-127808" class="wp-caption-text">A Dream, Burning Towers, Moving Bus, Fort Worth, Texas (2006)</figcaption></figure></div>
<p><span class="dropcap">P</span><span class="smallcaps">resident joe biden</span> ran a successful campaign on the myth of the American character. He promised the American people that he would restore the nation’s soul as well as its standing at home and abroad. He called Trump’s presidency an “aberrant moment in time” and reassured exhausted voters that it wasn’t too late to turn things around for the country. </p>
<p>More than 81 million Americans voted for Biden, the most votes a candidate has won in any American election. Trump garnered the second highest number of votes, almost 74 million&mdash;nearly 10 million more than he won four years ago. By any calculation, this election was not a repudiation of Trump or his policies. His 2016 declaration was prophetic: “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose voters.” Trump is the end-stage manifestation of America’s malignant self-deception. Biden’s victory doesn’t change this diagnosis, and his job got harder. On January 6, Trump fortified his supporters with another helping of lies about a stolen election, then watched them storm the Capitol Building, an attack that has so far claimed five lives and telegraphed America’s wounds around the world.</p>
<p>In a nation riven by racial pain, discrimination, violence, and poverty, the biggest threat is not what divides Americans but what they have in common: the abiding lie that America is the greatest country in the world.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n 1991,</span> my sister wrote a letter to Ed and Pat from England. In it, she catalogued the horrors of her childhood and the shadow it cast over her present. I got a copy of the letter at the same time and dreaded what might happen next. I didn’t hear from either Pat or Ed, and a week later, I got a call from a police officer telling me my father was dead. I assumed Ed had killed himself. It wasn’t until I got to Scarborough ­General Hospital, where my mother was waiting, that I learned he had died of a heart attack. He was sixty-two.  </p>
<p>Ed had hidden the letter from Pat. My second oldest ­brother told me I had to find it before it killed Pat as well. After the ­funeral, my siblings went home to England, Vancouver, Ottawa, Chicago, California, and Connecticut. (There were fewer of us together in the same room when my mother died, in 2003.) It was just Pat and me and my six-week-old son left in ­Toronto. For weeks, I got regular phone calls from my ­brother asking if I’d located the letter. I hadn’t, because I’d never looked for it.</p>
<p>Months after Ed’s death, Pat called me, crying un­controllably, and I knew immediately that she had found the ­letter. I wondered what had taken her so long. I went to see her at her apartment, in Don Mills, where we sat across from each other at the dining room table. She asked me if it was true, what my sister had written in the letter. I understood that the question was a dare; Pat didn’t look away until I answered, Yes. I remember her hands resting lightly on her ­teacup. She looked past me, out the window, and told me she couldn’t remember anything like that ever happening in our family.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Huawei CFO’s detention has always been political. With Trump out, Trudeau shouldn’t wait to release Meng]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="735" height="485" src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Scott_MengWanzhou_735.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="A photograph of Meng Wanzou, wearing a dark dress and heels, being led past a crowd of people photographing her." loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="" /><p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n June</span>, a coalition of nineteen former politicians, public servants, academics, and public figures addressed a letter to prime minister Justin Trudeau, urging the government to take a bold, unprecedented step: a prisoner trade between Canada and China. The eclectic mix of signatories, which included former Liberal foreign affairs minister Lloyd Axworthy, Supreme Court justice Louise Arbour, NDP leader Ed Broadbent, and Conservative foreign affairs minister Lawrence Cannon, argued that the government should halt the extradition case of detained Chinese national and Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, who faces fraud charges in the United States. In so doing, the letter writers reasoned, the door could be open for China to reciprocate by releasing “the two Michaels” (Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor), Canadian expats who were detained in China shortly after Meng’s December 2018 arrest.</p>
<p>By the time of the letter-writing, the outlines of the Meng case had become widely reported. The daughter of Huawei’s billionaire founder and a prominent figure in China, Meng was arrested during a stopover at the Vancouver International Airport due to allegations that she had manipulated a US-based bank into financing Huawei’s trade activities in Iran. The alleged act was in violation of US sanctions, so Meng was detained at the Americans’ behest. If extradited and convicted, Meng is facing up to thirty years in a US jail.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the two Michaels have become a Canadian <em>cause célèbre</em>. The media have described them as de facto hostages seized by China in retaliation for Meng. The two face serious (if unreasonable) national security charges and have remained in a Chinese jail, in allegedly spartan conditions with minimal family contact and limited consular access since the start of COVID-19. In a June interview with the CBC, Kovrig’s wife, Vina Nadjibulla, argued that the two Michaels’ lives were at risk.</p>
<p>The letter was not the first attempt by credentialed Canadians to press Trudeau to broker a deal in the Meng case. But the response from the Trudeau government was withering. A day after the letter went public, Trudeau pushed back in a press conference, contending that to concede to China would embolden hostage takers and suggest that the government could be blackmailed. He dismissed suggestions that the country’s leaders should intervene in an “independent” court process. Across the country, editorials, including one in the <em>Globe and Mail</em>, supported Trudeau’s line and demonized China. Certain media would later conflate details of the Meng case with reports of other Chinese abuses, including the government’s treatment of the Uyghurs and the Hong Kong protesters&mdash;seemingly to drive home the argument that China is a rules-flouting superpower that should be constrained, not bargained with. </p>
<p>Amid all the crossfire, one element in this escalating international standoff seemed absent from the discussion: that the US’s request to detain and extradite Meng was itself a deeply political act. The effect of this omission is consequential. Proposals to release Meng have been reduced to a debate of head versus heart: the humanitarian concern for “the two Michaels” competing against concern for Canada’s judicial independence. But factor in the American element, and Canadians are compelled to ask rather different questions. Meng’s arrest came at a time when the Trump administration was escalating tensions with both China and Iran. In detaining Meng and moving forward with her extradition, our courts have become tools of Donald Trump’s foreign policy&mdash;an agenda that Canada does not always share. Over the past four years, our government has been cautious to a fault when it comes to not antagonizing the Trump administration, but now, with a new American administration incoming, our political leaders can use the opportunity to assess the Meng case from a new perspective: caught between two competing superpowers, freeing Meng may be the just thing to do.</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n the US</span>, the decision to make an extradition request lies with the top bureaucrats in the Department of Justice&mdash;all political appointees who can be hired or fired at will by the president. Because not all indictments made by district federal courts result in extradition requests, this is a discretionary matter dependent on the bureaucrats’ and the administration’s priorities. Over the last four years, Trump’s crass attempts to bully and influence the Department of Justice toward certain actions have been evident. It wouldn’t be surprising if this led, at least in part, to Meng’s arrest.</p>
<p>It would be wilful ignorance to disregard two foreign policy priorities that the Trump administration was acting on in 2018. First, in May, the US reneged on the nuclear deal with Iran that the Obama administration and European powers had signed in 2015. The deal involved sanctions relief in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear enrichment, and after unilaterally leaving the agreement, the Trump administration sought to isolate the country once again. Second, in November, then attorney general Jeff Sessions announced the government’s new China Initiative: an aggressive drive by the Justice Department to combat perceived cases of intellectual property theft by China. Around the same time, officials were fretting publicly about the security consequences of letting Chinese internet providers&mdash;Huawei in particular&mdash;penetrate the US market.</p>
<p>Meng’s alleged crime as CFO of Huawei dates back to 2013&mdash;two years before Barack Obama’s Iran deal&mdash;when she is said to have lied about the company’s involvement in an Iran-based subsidiary when soliciting a loan from a branch of HSBC. Meng’s legal team contests the allegation, but if the charges are true, Meng would indeed have manipulated the bank, exposing it to potential losses in the form of fines for violating US sanctions on Iran. Still, as far as criminal cases go, this is a charge that at least one expert has argued would not normally rise to the level of an extradition request.</p>
<p>However, Meng’s arrest took place in the context of these two campaigns in US foreign policy battles. A few months after announcing its withdrawal from the Iran deal in May 2018, the US slapped sanctions back on Iran and began threatening countries that bought Iranian oil. Against this backdrop, the logical effect of Meng’s arrest would be to create a chilling effect among investors contemplating doing business in Iran and further choke Iran’s economy.  </p>
<p>There is no doubt that the charges against Meng are, technically, justified by US law. But what is egregious about Trump’s abandonment of the Iran deal and subsequent campaign against Meng is that it can undermine faith in the international treaty system. The world is full of unpalatable regimes, and at the same time, there are substantive, transnational issues that need to be dealt with through diplomacy&mdash;arms control, territorial disputes, climate change, and human rights among them. Canada has an interest helping to maintain a world order where war is not the fallback mechanism for resolving these disputes. But, for treaties to work, there has to be a generalized trust that all parties will honour their commitments. By waging economic warfare against Iran, Trump contravened the essence of his predecessor’s promise. Canada, meanwhile, chose not to condemn the US’s trust-breaking behaviour but rather to condone and even facilitate it.</p>
<p>But the Meng case goes beyond a dispute with Iran. When it comes to US relations with China, there are other forces at play. On December 11, 2018, ten days after Meng was arrested, Trump explicitly politicized the case by stating, in an interview with Reuters, that he would consider facilitating Meng’s release as part of a trade deal with China. This eagerness to link one woman’s fate with trade concessions raises the uncomfortable prospect that Meng’s arrest might have been prioritized not because of the merits of the case against her but to gain political advantage. </p>
<p>To be sure, the US (and Canada) have a laundry list of grievances against China. There are allegations of intellectual property theft accusing Huawei of targeting US companies. American conservatives consider the company to be an unfair competitor because it has benefited from research-and-development grants from the Chinese government. Also, the US and its allies have voiced concerns that Huawei 5G technology could be used for espionage, filtering information from NATO countries back to the Chinese government.</p>
<p>US concerns may be legitimate. And it may be prudent to consider China as a strategic competitor and consider steps, including the exclusion of Huawei 5G technology from our countries, to minimize the security risk (something the US has done and the Canadian military has recommended). But, all these conflicts aside, Trump’s focus on using Meng as a bargaining chip raises the question of whether her arrest was simply hostage-taking by another name.</p>
<p>Meng may be an executive at Huawei, but it would be monstrously unethical to target her for her country’s many alleged misdeeds. Yet, by inflating a relatively narrow charge of sanctions-dodging into a public spectacle, this is exactly what the Trump administration has done. If Canada is complicit in this, not only will it be an abasement of Canadian values, it could even be construed as condoning behaviour that approximates what China has done with the two Michaels: taking civilians, under a legal pretext, to make a political point. It is hardly in Canada’s interest to help bring about a world where this kind of behaviour is normalized.</p>
<p>In the two years since Meng’s arrest, Trudeau and deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland have stuck religiously to the line that extradition cases in Canada are decided exclusively by the courts, that our country is built on the rule of law. But this is a dodge. On a procedural level, after a suspect is arrested in accordance with an extradition request, it is the federal Ministry of Justice that makes the decision whether to proceed and enable the Crown to argue for the suspect’s extradition in front of a judge. Once a judgment is made, the case goes to the politically appointed justice minister, who once again has the discretion to extradite the suspect or refuse. The 1999 Extradition Act specifically empowers the minister to take into account the political context and motives of the foreign country making the extradition request when arriving at a decision. In a ten-page legal brief concerning the Meng case, addressed to the minister of justice last May, celebrated Toronto lawyer Brian Greenspan argued that, even in cases where the evidence against a person subject to an extradition request may be true, the justice minister is empowered to evaluate whether there is a policy motive behind the decision to prosecute and, if so, whether that motive is compatible with Canada’s national interest.</p>
<p>Canada still has a choice to make&mdash;the legal decision to extradite Meng will likely be made sometime in 2021. And, though there are now rumblings that the US is trying to strike a deal of its own with China to release Meng in exchange for an admission of wrongdoing, Canada shouldn’t wait to act. The US prosecution of Meng has always been political, and the Liberals should finally treat it as such. It’s not too late for our leaders to stop enabling the Trump regime’s conflicts with both China and Iran&mdash;especially since that regime has been repudiated by American voters and will soon cease to exist.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/why-canada-should-finally-free-meng-wanzhou/">Why Canada Should Finally Free Meng Wanzhou</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

The background is a very dark blue" loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="" /><p>In a 1969 address to the US National Press Club, then prime minister Pierre Trudeau delivered his famous analogy about our southern neighbour: “Living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant.” </p>
<p>As of last March, however, the elephant has been self-isolating. With the US–Canada border officially closed to nonessential travel as a result of the pandemic, there has been an unprecedented breach in the usual fluidity between our two countries. </p>
<p>Much has been made of the ideological differences between president-elect Joe Biden and Donald Trump, whose presidency has led to America’s increasing isolation from the rest of the world over the past few years. But, regardless of the changes in the White House ahead, many of the immediate challenges Canada is facing remain the same. We’re dealing with lockdowns, quarantines, job losses, and the devastating loss of more than 10,000 people as of this writing. The pandemic is the real superpower today.</p>
<p>With that in mind, in the <a href="https://store.walrusmagazine.com/products/free-tote-bag-with-subscription-just-30?_pos=3&#038;_sid=8db029d84&#038;_ss=r">January/February 2021 issue of The Walrus</a>, we are looking at how to move on.</p>
<p>In this year’s O’Hagan Essay on Public Affairs, “The Myth of Universal Health Care,” surgeon and educator Nadine Caron and family doctor and hospital executive Danielle Martin use their observations from inside the medical system to posit what it would take to create truly universal health care. In his essay, “<a href="https://thewalrus.ca/livingrooms-how-to-save-the-middle-class/">How to Save the Middle Class</a>,” Max Fawcett looks at the conventional metrics used by economists and politicians, such as GDP, with a view to whether they hold up&mdash;and lays out the benefits of adapting to a new set of definitions for twenty-first century success and, dare we say it, well-being. This article is also published as part of </a><em><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/livingrooms/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Living Rooms</a></em>, an ongoing series on housing and home.</p>
<p>And, in “<a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-new-lobster-wars/">The New Lobster Wars</a>,” Zoe Heaps Tennant reports on the tensions between Mi’kmaw fishers, commercial fishers, and federal authorities in Nova Scotia&mdash;ultimately asking: How do we honour treaties that were signed in the 1700s and have never been fully implemented?</p>
<p>As we go into what will likely be another year full of big questions, there is still lightness to be found&mdash;some of it informed by lessons from 2020. For this double issue, we invited Canadian artists to illustrate what they’re looking forward to in 2021. The results paint a portrait of optimism, of expectations for change, and more than anything, of resilience. It is our hope that, in uncertain times, The Walrus can provide a bridge into the world to come.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe Biden may have won the presidency, but the broken system that brought us Donald Trump is far from fixed]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="1320" src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Nelles_americandemocracy_1200_02.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="A red silhouette of Donald Trump in profile against the text of the US Constitution. Within Trump&#039;s red silhouette is a smaller, blue silhouette of Joe Biden." loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="" /><p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smallcaps">n November 7</span>, at a drive-in rally in Delaware, Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate for US president, declared victory. After four years of Donald Trump, the address Biden delivered was stunningly, platitudinously normal. “It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again,” he said. “And, to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans.” Biden had to give this kind of come-together speech; it’s even possible he believes it. But the social and institutional sickness that Trump exposed&mdash;the rot at the heart of American democracy&mdash;will not go away. As the Trump years end and the Biden era begins, the United States will be stuck with a few bleak truths.</p>
<p><b>1. Trump is here to stay&mdash;and so is Trumpism.</b> </p>
<p>Seventy-nine million people voted for Joe Biden&mdash;the most votes received by any presidential candidate in American history. Seventy-three million picked Donald Trump&mdash;the second-most votes received by any presidential candidate in American history. An election that should have been a cakewalk for Democrats came down, instead, to a sliver of votes in a handful of states: 21,000 votes in Wisconsin, 12,000 votes in Georgia, 10,000 votes in Arizona. Meanwhile, would-be battlegrounds, like Florida and Texas, remained comfortably red. This is after four years of unparalleled chaos in American life: a presidential impeachment; the near-daily torrent of leaks, scandals, and outrage; a pandemic that has, to date, claimed a quarter-million lives in the US; and one of the worst economic crises in recent history. The 2020 election was supposed to be an unambiguous repudiation of Trumpism. It wasn’t.</p>
<p>Trumpism is not a coherent political philosophy. It’s a mess of spontaneous hatreds, cultural chauvinism, and false populism, intermittently fused to conservative orthodoxy and channelled via the bizarrely captivating avatar of the man himself. Trump is not a genius&mdash;he is, in fact, pretty stupid&mdash;but he can be intuitive. He has a carnival barker’s sense of his audience and a remarkable hold on a huge chunk of the public. That hold is not going away any time soon. Even when Trump vacates the White House&mdash;hardly a guarantee, considering his ongoing refusal to concede&mdash;he will likely continue to insist that the election was rigged, and tens of millions of Americans will continue to believe him. He will keep lobbing Twitter grenades over the White House fence, perhaps in preparation for another campaign. There are already whispers that he will run again in four years, and there are the ever-present rumors of Trump TV, a media empire even further right than Fox News. </p>
<p>The GOP is now Trump’s fiefdom in every meaningful respect. He has scrambled the basic tenets of conservatism and dramatically altered the bounds of polite discussion. A few old-guard Republicans may survive the coming years&mdash;the Senate’s resident cowards, like Ben Sasse and Mitt Romney, who chide Trump on matters of tone, then unfailingly support his tax cuts and judicial nominees. But most establishment Republicans, like Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell, have realized that they must adapt or die. Biden’s win received a handful of tepid acknowledgements from moderate GOP senators&mdash;Susan Collins of Maine congratulated him on his “apparent victory”&mdash;but the vast majority of the party remains either silent on, or supportive of, Trump’s spurious claim that the election was rigged. The party’s leaders are betting that the rank-and-file will remain in thrall to him; they don’t want to risk a primary challenge or a Twitter broadside. Indeed, down-ballot Republicans are now parroting Trump’s voter-fraud lie in their own races. Baltimore-area House candidate Kimberley Klacik, who lost to the Democratic incumbent by more than forty points, is insisting she actually won.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Republican base has developed a taste for blood. If Trump doesn’t run again in 2024, it’s hard to imagine the MAGA hordes baying for, say, a mild-mannered traditionalist like Ohio senator Rob Portman to take up the cause. Instead, a generation of Trump acolytes&mdash;Mike Pence, of course, but also men like Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz&mdash;will compete to inherit his mantle. None of those candidates have Trump’s strange star power, and their efforts to imitate him will probably fall short (see: Marco Rubio’s failed turn as an insult comic in 2016). But it is chilling to imagine them in power. They will be more disciplined enforcers of the new Republican normal&mdash;more effective administrators of empire abroad and minority rule at home. </p>
<p>There is another possibility for 2024: the Trump clan’s evolution into a political dynasty. Donald Jr. is popular on the alt-right and, despite his near-total lack of charisma, a huge hit at rallies. Ivanka, her father’s favoured child, is the family’s more palatable representative, the one tasked with hitting the campaign trail to woo back the “suburban housewives” Trump drove away. Although Trump doesn’t want to lose the presidency, he seems to palpably dislike being president&mdash;it’s hard and boring and everyone is mean to him. But he’s adept at stoking rivalry among his brood, inculcating in them the same competition for approval his own father fostered in him. Installing one of his children in the country’s highest office would be a fitting final act to the Oedipal drama of his life.</p>
<p>Trumpism’s staying power won&#8217;t be limited to the Republican Party itself. The last four years have seen an extraordinary explosion of white nationalism and far-right terrorism, and it’s naive to predict that a Biden presidency will slow that growth. The Tea Party, remember, arose in reaction to Barack Obama; the only reason we no longer talk about anything called “the Tea Party” is because it is now indistinguishable from mainstream conservative belief. Indeed, we’re already seeing a new version of this phenomenon, with Republican candidates openly supportive of QAnon&mdash;the Trump-worshipping Satanic-pedophile conspiracy theory&mdash;being elected to the House of Representatives and absorbed cozily into the party. In the coming years, there may well be more of everything that has flourished during the Trump era: more gubernatorial kidnapping plots, more hate crimes, more white-supremacist terrorism, more conspiracy theories, more street clashes between right- and left-wing activists.</p>

</ul>
<p><b>2. The Republican Party will keep clinging to power.</b></p>
<p>For Democrats, the country’s increasingly diverse demography looks favourable, prompting political observers to forecast a future era of deep-blue rule. But there are problems with this prediction. For one, pundits have been making it for years. In 2013, after two consecutive presidential losses, the Republican National Committee commissioned an autopsy that insisted the party do more to broaden its appeal. Three years later, of course, Trump did what neither John McCain nor Mitt Romney could: he won, and he did it on outright racial grievance.</p>
<p>The second problem: demography isn’t destiny. This year, Trump not only netted more votes overall than he did in 2016&mdash;according to some polls, he actually gained support among constituencies that were supposed to be anathema to him. Trump’s support among both Black men and Black women rose by small but significant margins. He earned a substantial increase in support among Latino Americans, not only in states like Florida and Texas but throughout the country. Of course, racialized people still overwhelmingly vote Democrat, but it’s notable that Trump’s gains came after four years of “kids in cages,” of “shithole countries,” of “build the wall,” of “very fine people on both sides.” In fact, the only major demographic group in which Trump’s support declined was white men. People are complicated; racial, ethnic, and linguistic groups are not monoliths. It’s possible we’re seeing the beginnings of a new Republican coalition&mdash;much as earlier generations of Irish and Italians and Eastern Europeans transformed from “ethnic” to “white” voters and moved into the conservative fold. Democrats take Black and Latino-American support for granted at their peril.</p>
<p>The third problem for Democrats is the antidemocratic nature of American institutions. The electoral college is infamously unbalanced&mdash;only in America could a candidate lose by nearly 3 million votes, as Trump did in 2016, and still legally win an election. So, too, is the Senate, where the two Republican representatives of Wyoming (population 570,000) get the same votes as the two Democratic representatives of California (population 39.5 million). That’s not to mention the disproportionate power wielded by the states, where the majority of governorships and legislatures are Republican held. Even if the House of Representatives remains friendlier ground for Democrats, and even if a Republican presidential candidate never again wins the popular vote, the GOP will continue to exercise veto power over the country’s progress.</p>
<p>Republicans’ final advantage is that they are shameless. The basic GOP electoral strategy is fourfold: ensure that traditional Democratic voters are unable to cast ballots thanks to stringent ID requirements, modern-day poll taxes, and voter-roll purges; gerrymander districts into logic-defying contortions in order to entrench white rule; cram the judiciary with hard-right ideologues who will side with their benefactors in any voting-rights dispute; and soak the entire process in so much money that the average voter will, understandably, feel too alienated to bother. This strategy predates Trump&mdash;the “voter fraud” myth began with everyone’s favorite anti-Trump Republican, George W. Bush, whose campaign used it gratuitously during the 2000 Florida recount. We can have a democracy, or we can have the modern Republican Party, but we can’t have both.</p>
<p><b>3. The Democratic Party can’t meet the moment&mdash;yet.</b></p>
<p>The nationwide relief at Biden’s win has disguised the fact that this election was otherwise a disaster for Democrats. The party will lose at least five seats in the House and is only narrowly holding on to its majority. Senate races that were supposed to be nail-biters, or at least competitive, weren’t even close. Susan Collins won reelection by nine points, Lindsey Graham by eleven, Mitch McConnell by more than twenty; Democrats poured hundreds of millions of dollars into those races for nothing. Control of the Senate now comes down to January’s runoff elections in Georgia. Considering Biden’s razor-thin margin of victory there, it’s very hard to imagine those seats going blue&mdash;Georgia hasn’t elected a Democrat senator in twenty years.</p>
<p>Predictably, blame for Democrats’ poor showing has already been foisted upon the party’s left flank. A moderate Democrat congresswoman from Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, said in a private caucus call that Democrats could “never use the words <em>socialist</em> or <em>socialism</em> ever again.” This excuse might be persuasive if it weren’t so tired. Hillary Clinton blamed Bernie Sanders for her loss four years ago; in the Obama era, when the party had no socialist wing to speak of, Democrats suffered wave upon wave of historic losses in the House, the Senate, and state legislatures. A more compelling explanation for the party’s 2020 defeats may be that Joe Biden made the election a referendum on Donald Trump. That was enough for Democrats to win the presidency but little else.</p>
<p>At the first presidential debate, Biden broke through Trump’s interruptions long enough to say one thing of note: “I am the Democratic Party right now,” he insisted, rebuffing an accusation of socialism. If that’s true, Democrats are in trouble. It isn’t just that a seventy-eight-year-old white male moderate hardly seems representative of a party that is getting younger, more diverse, and more progressive; it’s that Biden’s entire philosophy is the vestigial tail of a more primitive creature. Democrats like Biden believe politics is about the business of governing. Republicans, on the other hand, recognize the truth, which is that politics is about the raw exercise of power. Republicans make no apologies about the extremity of their beliefs or the dirtiness of their tactics, while Democrats still behave as though decorum matters and technocracy will win the day. The country is at war with itself, though only Republicans seem to recognize this.</p>
<p>That’s to say nothing of where Biden and the rest of the Democratic establishment stand on the actual issues. In a year when millions of Americans have lost their health insurance, a year when climate change has become more threatening than ever, it’s depressing (though not surprising) to hear Biden disown Medicare for All and the Green New Deal&mdash;exactly the sorts of ambitious programs the moment demands. Democrats may argue he needs to do this to avoid alienating swing voters, but that’s because they’re thinking like Democrats: sticking to the terms of the debate rather than rewriting them. The US needs a wholesale transformation of its political culture, and that won’t happen as long as Democrats keep ceding rhetorical ground.</p>
<p>If there’s a source of hope, it’s in the newfound swagger of the Democrats’ left flank&mdash;in the recent victories of insurgents like Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush, who ran on brazenly progressive platforms. The progressive wing of the party is finally figuring out what hard-right Republicans learned a decade ago: in politically safe districts, there’s no reason to compromise. If the limits of American discourse are ever going to shift, Democrats need to speak as boldly on every key issue&mdash;jobs, taxation, policing, abortion, the environment&mdash;as Republicans do. It’s not enough for Democrats to know what they stand against. The party needs to offer voters concrete improvements to their material conditions, and do it without hedging or apology.</p>
<p>The Biden campaign was premised on a return to normalcy, but the US has been irreparably transformed by the past four years. That’s not entirely a bad thing. The one redeeming quality of the Trump era has been the sense of possibility it created. Trump proved it was feasible to buck establishment consensus and build something new; he just did it in the service of his own roiling id. One can imagine another version of this transformation: a version in which Americans receive the same basic social-democratic rights&mdash;universal health care, guaranteed parental leave, some semblance of a safety net&mdash;afforded to citizens of other Western democracies. Then again, this is America we’re talking about. That may be too much to ask.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/three-truths-and-the-lie-of-american-democracy/">Three Truths and the Lie of American Democracy</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

Canada was still under British dominion at the time, and the plan, updated as recently as 1935, mapped out an invasion of its northern neighbour. The plan recommended that America steam into major cities like Halifax, Montreal, and Toronto in order to ensure the quick collapse of Canada&mdash;code name Crimson. “Crimson cannot successfully defend her territory against the United States,” the 1935 war plan concluded.</p>
<p>Canadians shouldn’t feel too precious: America had colour-coded war plans for plenty of foreign nations. Tan was Cuba, orange was Japan, indigo was Iceland, and so on. Americans, ever-adept military planners, had contingency plans for everything. From “stimulating Azores independence,” in case Portugal fell amid unrest in the 1970s, to extensive nuclear war plans in case of a Soviet strike.</p>
<p>“The word ‘if’ is the big operator in contingency planning,” a military officer told the <em>New York Times</em> in 1984. “If these guys do this, then we will do that. And you have to have more than one option, including the worst case.” (A Pentagon staffer told the <em>Times</em> that “we have plans around here for everything” but, when asked about plans regarding a possible Canadian invasion, offered: “Well, not quite that.”)</p>
<p>Election day has come and gone in America, the conclusion of four years of tension and tumult and the coda to one of the most miserable and gruelling US presidential campaigns in modern memory. As the projections trickled in, and the results showed an anxiety-inducing neck-and-neck race, Trump took to the stage at a 2:30 a.m. press conference, from the White House, to allege that the Democrats were trying to “disenfranchise” voters&mdash;by counting all the votes. It had all the hallmarks of a man trying desperately to cling to power. Even as Tuesday night stretched into Wednesday morning, the results in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Georgia, and North Carolina remained too close to call. Wisconsin looks set to go to a recount.</p>
<p>Officials in government, from Global Affairs Canada to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, should have been&mdash;and likely were&mdash;running through every possible scenario, no matter how dire or unlikely. Even as the electoral map points to an increasingly probable Biden victory, a situation in flux means anything is possible. As Canadians, we haven’t often had the occasion to confront America’s democratic deficits or its institutional shortcomings. They were punchlines or academic concerns, but now they are very much out in the open.</p>
<p>Contingency planning is an art. It means drawing up a list of predictions that go well beyond who will win and who won’t. It requires the government to envision civil unrest, court battles, constitutional crises, and international chaos. Indeed, there are few times when such contingency plans have been more necessary.</p>
<p>The last four years have tested the American system, and it is creaking under the weight. If the dam breaks, it’s Canada that gets wet. What then?</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="smallcaps">onsider the</span> state of play:</p>
<p>From the White House, the president has been deeply skeptical of the rule of law. He has been a cheerleader for police abuse. He has encouraged the death penalty for drug dealers and praised foreign leaders who employ extrajudicial killings. He has celebrated, and even ordered, aggressive and militarized crackdowns by local, state, and federal police on largely peaceful demonstrations. He has vilified Black Lives Matter and antifascist protesters, who have organized to protest the indefensible killing of unarmed Americans.</p>
<p>In private chat rooms and on rural compounds, the militia movement, often driven by far-right, white supremacist, and neo-Nazi extremism, has shown a willingness to deploy violence&mdash;even regime change&mdash;to advance its goals of some ideologically or racially pure state. These movements are known to have infiltrated the American military despite the Pentagon’s best efforts to root them out. In October, six people were charged for orchestrating an actual coup in Michigan. They may well have succeeded in kidnapping the governor had they moved quicker. (Trump, meanwhile, has equivocated on whether the plan to overthrow the state government was, in fact, bad.)</p>
<p>Then there’s QAnon, the cultish movement that has been described as a conspiracy theory or a collective delusion. Its followers genuinely believe that Donald Trump is a crusader for good, pushing back against a Satanist deep state responsible for the mass abduction, imprisonment, and murder of children. They have taken to heart the president’s insistence that any result that does not return him to power is thanks to a devious fraud carried out on the American people.</p>
<p>Next up is COVID-19 “trutherism.” Deeply skeptical of scientific realities, adherents insist that lockdowns, mask orders, and the possibility of mandatory vaccinations are an infringement on their personal freedoms. Until now, they have had a man in the White House who has, at least in some respects, spoken their language. But, if the American government has to take more drastic measures to contain the spread of the virus, protests will likely ensue.</p>
<p>To date, problems presented by these realities have been manageable. Trump has not tried to deploy federal police or the national guard to serve his own ends&mdash;at least, not since June. The militia movement has been under close scrutiny, both from police and from nongovernmental watchdogs. Black Lives Matter and Antifa have continued to press for wholesale reform, not violent revolution. While individual QAnon adherents have shown a penchant for violence, there is no evidence thus far that the wider movement is an imminent threat, except maybe to our collective discourse. And the COVID-19 truthers have limited themselves to street protests and quixotic displays of supposed individual liberty. The resulting harm has been largely indirect rather than violent, apart from torching the occasional cellphone tower.</p>
<p>But contingency planning is the art of considering extreme scenarios. And things are already fairly extreme. As of right now, we have two men, both insisting on a claim to the White House.</p>
<p>History is littered with schisms that formed from competing claims to power. The Roman Catholic Church probably never anticipated having to face antipopes, but the period from 1309 to 1417 offers a cautionary tale of what can happen when, thanks to internecine power struggles stemming from frustration over an elected figure, there emerge rival claimants to a throne. America, of course, has very little in common with a medieval religious institution, but it wouldn’t hurt to remember that the Church spent decades in crisis watching competing pontiffs argue about who had authority over itself.</p>
<p>The rival claims to power in the presidential election stem from real and perceived problems with the conduct of the election itself. Even before voters went to the polls, nefarious tricks&mdash;closed polling locations, burned ballot boxes, and voter suppression&mdash;conspired to tip the scales in the Republicans’ favour. Now that the votes have arrived and several states hang in the balance of mail-in ballots, there are a litany of dirty tricks that could be pulled out to disqualify those early votes, which disproportionately hurts the Democrats. Trump has already said, fairly bluntly, that the counting should stop in certain battleground states, and that he will go to the Supreme Court to get his way.</p>
<p>The courts’ role in safeguarding democracy is an open question. There is a credible and compelling case that court intervention, at many levels, in the 2000 Florida recount illegitimately put George W. Bush in the White House. It’s only gotten worse since then. A six-to-three conservative majority on the Supreme Court, and a recent trend toward nonintervention in contentious voting-rights cases, leaves it very much in doubt that the courts could beat back nefarious efforts to disqualify voters or throw out votes as the counting continues.</p>
<p>Then there’s the wonkery of the system itself and the possibility of “faithless electors,” or actual members of the electoral college who opt to vote differently than their state’s wishes. In 2016, Bernie Sanders, John Kasich, Faith Spotted Eagle, and Colin Powell all technically won electoral college votes because the electors themselves were aghast at the way their states had voted and opted for an alternative candidate. A handful of faithless electors could, in theory, change the results of an election.</p>
<p>And, finally, there’s Capitol Hill. There are some series of events that could lead to a tie vote&mdash;which would need to be decided by Congress. There is all sorts of procedural chicanery that could be used on that front. The Democrats, even if they hold the lower house, have regularly found themselves on the losing side of conflicts due to a pathological insistence to play by the rules.</p>
<p>Any president who tries to take power, armed with a ruling from a stacked court or a mandate from a floor vote, will have a legitimacy problem. But seemingly illegitimate power is still power, if you can hold on. Trump may convince himself he has good reason to dispatch law enforcement into the streets, to quell protests that may arise from a contested result. Even if Black Lives Matter and Antifa have legitimate grievances with a president looking to consolidate power, they may prove a useful foil for Trump. Other supporters could mobilize themselves. Militias are already describing these results as a “coup” and have the means and motivation to take to the streets. Even if a winner is declared, there is sure to be a sizeable chunk of the population that will refuse to accept the results and may see it as their duty to fight back.</p>
<p>So, for Canada, what do we do in a scenario of prolonged US turmoil? Five years ago, in fact, Ottawa sought some help to anticipate what would happen in the event that the country was under threat. It asked a security contractor to assess the vulnerability of critical infrastructure in light of possible terror attacks or insurrection. Of course, these checks were precautions&mdash;it’s better to be safe, as they say, than sorry&mdash;but that 2015 assessment had little to do with what we’re currently facing: uncertain results, a defiant incumbent, a tense and fractious security situation.</p>
<p>What happens if America can’t form a government? Congress, after all, has only funded operations until December. America has had shutdowns before, but there’s no telling what happens if there’s no government in office to end them. A protracted and widespread government shutdown could hobble trade or the movement of critical goods necessary for Canadian supply chains. Our continental air-defence systems rely on American radars and jets. International security largely relies on American troops stationed abroad to dissuade expansionary foreign powers like Russia. Violence and strife could propel a wave of immigration across the border&mdash;both those who hoped for refuge in America and Americans fleeing the chaos.</p>
<p>These are all medium-term problems. As we know from failed states worldwide, once democracy snaps, it can take a long time to repair. What does it mean for Canada to live next to a broken system for the foreseeable future? What does that mean for our economy, our media, our society? Nothing good.</p>
<p>The most likely scenario is that all the bad things I’ve described do not happen. The most probable scenario is that votes don’t get trashed en masse, the courts ensure every vote gets counted, Congress doesn’t have to pick a president, and both sides accept the results. Even if the process does go awry, the odds are good that American democracy stays resilient and the courts do their job credibly. At the very least, even if all the systems break and norms crumble, we can almost certainly count on the vast majority of Americans staying level-headed and gritting their teeth to make whatever fractured result work.</p>
<p>America is one of the most robust and complicated democracies in the world. It will take more than this to break it.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The controversial conservative export on his fears for the US election and the future of the Republican Party]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="1606" src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Gillespie_DavidFrum_1200.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="" srcset="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Gillespie_DavidFrum_1200.jpg 1200w, https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Gillespie_DavidFrum_1200-1148x1536.jpg 1148w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smallcaps">n the evening</span> of November 2, 2018, a Munk Debate took place at Toronto’s Roy Thomson Hall arguing the proposition that the future of Western politics is populist, not liberal. As the beginning drew near, protests erupted in front of the venue because the organizers had chosen Steve Bannon&mdash;architect of the Trump campaign, former leader of the alt-right Breitbart empire, Svengali to apprenticing authoritarians, and the world’s foremost proponent of the slept-in blazer&mdash;to argue on behalf of populism. But commentators were also aghast at the person tasked with defending the values of classical liberalism: David Frum. Yes, that David Frum: the Axis of Evil neocon who served in the George W. Bush White House, boisterously supported the Iraq War, and authored a handful of books advocating hardline conservative policies.</p>

<p>Not, in other words, the kind of CV that shouts out “defender of liberal values.” “When it’s left to David Frum to hold the line against Steve Bannon&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;” Naomi Klein tweeted, “these Munk Debates are a disgrace.”</p>
<p>The event was held up for over half an hour due to the commotion outside the entrance. There were some minor skirmishes, multiple arrests. Inside, someone unveiled a banner that read, “No hate. No bigotry. No place for Bannon’s white supremacy.” Bannon grinned at the spectacle. Frum sat, patient and bemused. Once underway, the moderator began to explain the scoring method. The crowd would vote now and again at the end of the evening with provided clickers. The debate could finally begin.</p>
<p>As the evening progressed, Bannon found various ways to say that populism was about the people, not about authoritarianism; Frum found various ways to say that liberal democracy was responsible for most of society’s major advances of the last three centuries. There was some engagement and the occasional direct rebuttal, but it was mostly a mild affair: two men expressing different world views. There was no animosity, little tension, and in fact, Bannon consistently expressed his admiration for Frum’s insight, compliments that were off-putting in their own right. Having Steve Bannon praise your intellect is like having Dracula admire your shirt collar.</p>
<p>After about eighty minutes of speeches, the debate was over. It was up to the audience now. After a few minutes of tabulating the results, the numbers popped up on the giant screen behind the participants. There was an audible gasp. At the beginning of the debate, 72 percent of attendees had disagreed with the proposition that populism would soon supplant liberalism. After they heard both sides, that figure dropped to 57 percent&mdash;Frum, defender of liberal democracy, had somehow managed to lose much of the room. Audience members were open mouthed. Frum seemed stunned. Bannon, quite graciously, said, “If we don’t convert people of the stature of David Frum into our movement as the public intellectuals, we’re not going to have a movement.” Frum congratulated Bannon: “As in 2016, the rural vote came in.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t until later that night, long after the results had rippled through social media, that the Munk team posted a <em>mea culpa</em> online. Due to a technical glitch, they had gotten the numbers wrong: 72 percent of the crowd had <em>still</em> not supported the proposition. Either way, it remained a win for Bannon&mdash;his alt-right acolytes simply claimed another example of the left rewriting history to suit its own ends.</p>
<p>There were many possible conclusions to be drawn from the Munk affair: that, after all the effort, no minds were changed; that the organizers had lost the data and tried to fudge it; that the whole thing had been a charade anyway since Frum made the mistake of taking the debate seriously whereas Bannon seemed to treat it like a lark. But lost amid the debacle was maybe the most important takeaway of all: the event revealed the nearly complete evolution of David Frum. The man who played as prominent a role in American politics as any Canadian likely ever has&mdash;and as a Republican, no less&mdash;had returned home to cement the growing understanding that he is no longer a reactionary warmonger (admittedly my own read for many years) but is in fact a thinker of centrist and even certain left-leaning positions: a convert to war skepticism, a proclaimed internationalist, a supporter of universal health care, a believer in same-sex marriage, an upholder of the role of government, and most prominently, one of the few leading Republicans who was willing to pay the price to say, loudly and often, that Donald Trump is a craven, amoral, criminal, empty, narcissistic, inept liar. Which, as the 2020 election season moves into the almost-can’t-bear-to-watch phase, makes Frum the most consistent and insightful conservative interpreting what’s happening. In fact, other than the immigration file, on which Frum remains something of a restrictionist, it may seem fair to conclude he’s now an out-and-out liberal. Which really leaves only one question: How the hell did that happen?</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he children</span> of famous parents evolve in various ways. Some retreat entirely, forging private lives. Some struggle to find themselves. Others become minor replicas of their famous progenitors. Then there are those like Frum and his senator sister, Linda, who become parent adjacent, putting down career roots on a different street in the same neighbourhood. Frum’s mother, Barbara, died in 1992, at the age of fifty-four, from chronic leukemia. It is probably difficult for a younger audience to properly contextualize the influence and reach she possessed in the later decades of her life. After hosting the CBC Radio program <em>As It Happens</em>, which she started doing in 1971, she moved to television in 1982 and hosted <em>The Journal</em>, which, following <em>The National</em> each night, offered more in-depth reporting and narrative, a kind of daily <em>60 Minutes</em>. It was during this period that she became a household figure in Canada, famous for her fearless reporting and professional manner that occasionally allowed for a grin or a chuckle.</p>
<p>But only occasionally. Her persona as a tough interviewer was so entrenched that the Maritime comedy show <em>Codco</em> ran a segment, called “The Jugular,” in which Greg Malone, impersonating Barbara, interrogated hapless guests so as to draw out their pain and bitterness. She was such a good sport about the joke that she and Malone, in drag as Barbara, presented together at the Gemini Awards one year. Canada’s <em>Sesame Street</em> even created a Muppet based on her, known as Barbara Plum. She was, in the days when there were few television channels and no widespread internet, not just omnipresent but universally respected in a way that seems impossible in today’s takedown culture. It felt appropriate that her memorial was broadcast on CBC TV, as if it were a state affair.</p>
<p>Barbara Frum may have been an icon, but she was also a mother and a wife. It was a strangely splintered upbringing for young David in that he had a famous (and imposing) mother and a wealthy (and genial) real estate developer father, yet death and mortality hung over the house every day. Frum’s father, Murray, was born in 1931, the year after his family came to Canada from Poland. The extended family remained behind, and almost every single member, on both sides, was murdered in the Holocaust. And, though hardly anyone knew it at the time, Barbara was first diagnosed with cancer and told she had one or two years to live in 1974, when she was thirty-seven and her son fourteen. </p>
<p>“We had a happy household in so many ways,” Frum told me by phone from his home in Washington, DC. “But that sense of things just off to stage left and stage right, of doom and danger around the corner, that was really a formative thing. Barbara had many sayings that we still quote, and one of them was, ‘There are those who know and those who don’t know,’ and what she meant by that was the knowledge of the potential for tragedy in human life, of loss, and just how near the surface loss and suffering are. That statement, which I didn’t appreciate enough when I was young, becomes more powerful as you go through life. You wanted to be one of those who knew, not one of those who didn’t know.”</p>
<p>There were other things Frum felt he came to know. It was in his mid-teens that he had his political “road to Damascus” moment. In the summer of 1975, he got a job working on the election campaign for a Toronto NDP candidate. It was also the summer that his mother gave him a copy of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s <em>The Gulag Archipelago</em>. As he trundled back and forth on transit&mdash;home to work, work to home&mdash;he read the book’s devastating indictment of the Soviet Union and its vast prison system. Frum was overtaken by a sense that the westernized left, which he saw as sympathizing with radical movements, had the world wrong. “It had this overpowering effect on me,” Frum told <em>The Nation</em> in 2012. He finished his placement, but reading Solzhenitsyn’s book instigated a reaction against the ideologies of the left, nascent and unformed as his belief still was then.</p>
<p>After high school, Frum went to Yale, where he pursued a simultaneous BA and MA in history. To most, it would seem a peak experience, but Frum doesn’t quite remember it that way. “I was clever in the sense of being pretty well-informed and verbally deft but also missing large dimensions of human wisdom. I was a very serious-minded young person. But I lacked things. There are so many things that I should have understood that I didn’t.”</p>
<p>Such as? </p>
<p>He paused, seemed to prepare an answer, but drew back. “Oh, I don’t know. But I was a hard worker. I really wanted to learn. And one of the things that we were all always told, as undergraduates, was that so many of your most valuable experiences here will happen outside of the library. And yet, for me, the most valuable experiences I had at college mostly happened inside the library.” </p>
<p>Following his graduation, he returned to Toronto, where, he said, he spent 1982 to 1984 “floundering.” He fell into a young-man-without-a-plan malaise that his mother finally addressed when she told him that, if he couldn’t decide on his future, she’d create one for him. Her vision started with law school, which Frum was not keen on. Barbara implored him to take the LSAT. He bought a sample test and scored seven out of twenty-two, which he used as evidence that law school was not in his genes. Dismissing his argument, Barbara took the same test and scored a perfect twenty-two. </p>
<p>“She had such a precise mind, and I guess I interpreted her score as a dare or a challenge, so I took the book back and worked on the sample tests until I could get twenty-two out of twenty-two, at which point, of course, she said I therefore had no excuse not to take the actual test. And then, once you write the actual test, it’s an escalator you can’t jump off.”</p>
<p>He attended Harvard Law School, where he also became more active politically, serving as president of the Federalist Society chapter, a conservative and libertarian law students’ group. Upon graduating, he met budding journalist Danielle Crittenden (in 1987, at a party hosted by his mother in their Toronto home). The two got married, and Frum soon joined the editorial page of the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and began vigorously inserting himself and his ideas into American politics. </p>
<p>Frum released his first book, 1994’s <em>Dead Right</em>, halfway into Bill Clinton’s first term. It was billed as a young conservative’s plan to rejuvenate the Grand Old Party by breaking free from its misguided post-Reagan preoccupations with culture-war targets (race, nationality, sex) and instead focusing on its traditional goals (business, small government, lower taxes). George Will, the éminence grise of the American right, said it was “as slender as a stiletto and as cutting.” Frank Rich, writing for the <em>New York Times</em>, called it “the smartest book written from the inside about the American conservative movement.” </p>
<p>The book marked Frum as an important new voice, especially for his willingness to say things other conservatives didn’t particularly want to hear, which became a pattern. During the remainder of the Clinton years, Frum continued to promote a politics focused on policy over ideology, but his was a conservatism that lost momentum as Newt Gingrich became the dominant Republican on Capitol Hill. Gingrich led a nasty and highly partisan rearguard culture war, a good part of which was focused on the morals, or lack thereof, of a Clinton gripped by a sex scandal. (It would later emerge that Gingrich himself was having an affair with a young aide during the same period.) However, when George W. Bush won the 2000 election, he did so after campaigning on a “compassionate conservatism” that distanced itself from Gingrich’s bellicose ways. Shortly thereafter, Frum, seemingly vindicated, was invited to join the White House as part of the president’s speech-writing team. It was a heady time for a Canadian who’d just had his fortieth birthday and who had moved to Washington from Toronto only in 1996. Frum was not Bush’s primary speechwriter&mdash;that role fell to Michael Gerson&mdash;but he was drafted to offer text on economic issues. It seemed the most enviable of times for a young conservative writer and thinker. </p>
<p>Except for one thing: it was the summer of 2001. </p>

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="smallcaps">rum’s youngest</span> daughter, Beatrice, was born in December 2001, three months after 9/11. He wrote in <em>Newsweek</em>, over a decade later, that his wife had nursed their newborn as F-16s screamed overhead. It was a perilous time for everyone, but especially for someone working in the White House, where staff briefings outlined plans for dealing with biological attacks, car bombings, targeted assassinations, and poisonous gas releases. It was in this fraught atmosphere that president Bush started laying the groundwork for launching the invasion of Iraq, a course of action now widely viewed as strategically flawed and, worse, morally disastrous in that it was based on a lie.</p>
<p>It’s been seventeen years since the war began, leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people (if not more). In the intervening years, Frum has many times admitted it was a bad decision, that he would do things differently if he knew then what he knows now. (He does not, however, like to use the word <em>regret</em>.) During our conversations, he didn’t try to evade culpability by pointing out that his influence in the White House was negligible, that he was a speechwriter, not an adviser. Still, whether he was an adviser or a hired pen, whether his role was lead or minor, his part in shaping the Iraq War narrative has defined him ever since, for one reason primarily.  </p>
<p>One day in late 2001, Frum was at work in the White House when Gerson came in and asked him to assist with the Iraq sections of the upcoming State of the Union speech. He posed the assignment as a “what if”&mdash;what might the president say about Iraq and the current state of global affairs if he were to pursue this or that course of action. Frum told me that everything he wrote was “in the conditional,” meaning that, as he was writing it, he believed he was spitballing. Frum originally wrote that Iran, Iraq, and North Korea comprised an “axis of hatred.” Gerson and fellow speechwriter Matthew Scully apparently liked the phrase and made a small adjustment. After Frum had delivered his notes and wordsmithing to Gerson, he was effectively out of the loop, which was why it came as a shock to him, as he and his wife were watching the speech on TV later in January, when Bush started railing about the Axis of Evil. </p>
<p>The phrase immediately became a flashpoint among both allies and enemies in the US and around the world. It was a succinct encapsulation of the Republican state of mind post-9/11, a pithy string of code that reinforced the long-simmering conflict as an urgent moral crusade. </p>
<p>Axisgate soon followed, wherein Crittenden sent an email to family and friends&mdash;one that <em>Slate</em> intercepted and published that February. “My husband is responsible for the ‘Axis of Evil’ segment of Tuesday’s State of the Union address. It’s not often a phrase one writes gains national notice,” Crittenden wrote. “So I’ll hope you’ll indulge my wifely pride in seeing this one repeated in headlines everywhere!!” The leak created a gossipy stir in the Georgetown cocktail-party circuit, but setting aside the unfortunate obliviousness of the email and the criticism it brought the family, the episode gave Frum an air of celebrity and cemented the image that he was deep inside the Republican machine. This was an astonishing ascendancy. If you were a right-winger, Frum’s work may have seemed like the ascent of a thinker and writer to his rightful place. Those to the left might have considered him not just a traitor to his country but to his mother’s legacy. </p>
<p>Frum’s time in the White House did not last long, however. He told me there were many reasons for leaving. One particular area of concern was his disagreement with the president’s high steel tariffs. “I wanted to shift from speechwriting&mdash;and political communication generally&mdash;to domestic policy work,” he explained. (Others, including writers in the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>Guardian</em>, speculated that Frum was pushed out of the White House for his wife’s email indiscretion.) Whatever the reason, Frum took his leave that February and joined the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a right-wing think tank.</p>
<p>Though out, Frum appeared to remain an insider. He quickly wrote a hawkish book, with Iraq War architect Richard Perle, which proclaimed the necessity of American global hegemony. This was followed by <em>The Right Man</em>, an account of the Bush presidency arguing that, whatever one thought of his record, the man himself was admirable. If Frum harboured hunger pangs, wanting to bite the hand that fed him and expand on his earlier project of examining the fault lines within the conservative movement, he hid them, at least for a few years. </p>
<p>Toward the end of the Bush era, he published <em>Comeback: Conservatism That Can Win Again</em>. It came on the heels of the Republicans losing Congress in 2006 but before Barack Obama’s rise. The book was significant for Frum because it recast him on an intellectual course rather than a policy one. Much like his <em>Dead Right</em> debut, <em>Comeback</em> argued that the right had lost its way and needed a major reset. Since Reagan, conservative ideology had held that the only way to make small government better was to make it even smaller and that the only good tax was a lowered tax. Frum contradicted both of these shibboleths. He also proclaimed his support for a carbon tax and, later, voiced his support for gay marriage. “The party needed to reinvent itself for the twenty-first century,” Frum told me. “The Cold War gave shape to Republican ideology for a generation. The party wandered until 9/11, when it seemed that Islamic terrorism would take the ideological place, as it were, of the Cold War. Obviously, the terror attacks were a terrible thing and they called for a response, but you couldn’t reorganize your whole politics around foreign terrorism. To some degree, I was part of that. But it was just wrong.”</p>
<p>The approach outlined in <em>Comeback</em> offered the GOP a set of ideas to rally around, to which it said, Thanks, but no thanks. Not only did the party reject the kind of regeneration Frum was advocating, but it also seemed to double down on the same kind of unreconstructed hyperbole and hysteria that surrounded the Iraq War. The path the Republican Party followed led to the continued growth of Fox News, the creation of the Tea Party, and, ultimately, the emergence of Donald Trump. It also led to the excommunication of David Frum.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t would be</span> an insult to true explorers to describe a man with a cushy post at a high-profile think tank as wandering in the woods, but nevertheless, after Obama entered the White House, in early 2009, Frum’s profile was as low as it had ever been. Yes, he was still publishing here and there, and he was no doubt engaged in some arcane political activity at the AEI, but he was standing on the edge of the dance floor. This interstitial period gave him time to ponder where he was going with his writing and his career, reflections that inevitably led back to growing up in the Frum household. The harsh truths of mortality may have been ever-present as Frum was growing up, but so too was intense political and intellectual engagement. Frum remembers his mother as a serious-minded person, and he describes her influence on him as “limitless.” I asked him what it was like to evolve as a thinker in his own right, moving to the right of the spectrum, knowing his mother was such a famous upholder of liberal causes. </p>
<p>“People say, ‘You and your mother had such different politics,’ and that’s not exactly right because my mother didn’t have politics the way people who have politics have them. She was a profoundly nonideological person,” he said, adding that his mother was someone who took every issue, every conversation, every point of debate at face value, starting at zero every time. She never approached an idea with a preset ideological bent. Frum shared this anecdote almost wistfully, as if part of him wished he had the capacity, or the opportunity, to do the same. “One of the reasons I so desperately miss the opportunity to talk to her is, with most people I know, even the most brilliant intellects, I might not be able to guess all the insights they would bring to a question, but I would know approximately what they would say. I know approximately what Chris Hitchens would say about Donald Trump. I can’t imagine the jokes he would make and the sparkling witticisms and the particular insights and details&mdash;that’s why we miss him&mdash;but I know approximately where he’d be.” Barbara was different. “What she taught us was not what to think but how to think. She was outside of all ideological categories, a profound analytical intelligence. And incredibly morally sensitive and morally demanding, of herself above all. I learned that from her, how to do that.”</p>
<p>These values were sorely tested during the Obama years. Although he was firmly seated at the AEI, Frum was already standing in uncertain relationship to the conservative movement. He respected Obama but did not support many of his more activist social policies, yet neither did Frum believe the GOP was positioning itself to appeal to most Americans. In March 2010, as Obama was signing the Affordable Care Act into legislation, Frum published on his website an essay titled “Waterloo,” in which he stated that, far from Obamacare being a Waterloo for the president, it would be the undoing of the GOP because the party failed to see that it was what Americans wanted. He made the case that the right should stop politicizing something that was good for the country and do its best to make the program better and more conservative-friendly. Republicans, he wrote, “followed the most radical voices in the party and the movement, and they led us to abject and irreversible defeat.” He rebuked Fox and conservative commentators for lying about health care and stoking a culture war. Rush Limbaugh said that he wanted president Obama to fail, wrote Frum, though “what he omitted to say&mdash;but what is equally true&mdash;is that he also wants Republicans to fail. If Republicans succeed&mdash;if they govern successfully in office and negotiate attractive compromises out of office&mdash;Rush’s listeners get less angry. And if they are less angry, they listen to the radio less, and hear fewer ads for Sleepnumber beds.”</p>
<p>The firestorm was immediate. The essay drew over a million views, crashing his site. Frum was castigated by fellow conservatives and, days later, fired from the AEI. Years afterward, writing in <em>The Atlantic</em>, he remembered how, because of that essay, “old friends grew suspicious and drifted away” and that he heard second- and third-hand “echoes of unpleasant explanations for my deviation from the ever-radicalizing main line of Washington conservatism. Increasingly isolated and frustrated, I watched with dismay as people I’d known for years and decades incited each other to jump together over the same cliff.” That essay, he wrote, was effectively his “suicide note in the organized conservative world.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smallcaps">uring the early years</span> of the first Obama term, it seemed like both the left and the right were wondering precisely what was happening to David Frum. “As the Tea Party has come to dominate the GOP, Frum has been transformed in a remarkably short period of time from right-wing royalty to apostate,” wrote Michelle Goldberg for <em>Tablet</em> in 2011. “His writing, once aggressive and hyper-confident&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;now seems elegiac.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you’ve heard the saying that, if you want a friend in Washington, get a dog,” Frum told Goldberg. “I have three dogs.”</p>
<p>In 2012, Frum went on to publish a book about Mitt Romney’s defeat, and two years later, he found the home that would effectively launch him on his current trajectory, that of senior editor at <em>The Atlantic</em>. From that platform, he has continued his mission to goad the conservative movement to adopt a less ideological and more centrist space. He has chronicled his intellectual evolution: about same-sex marriage, the environmental movement, the value of effective government, universal health care, and the nature of military conflict. He has never apologized for his prowar positions, but he’s expressed some remorse, to varying degrees, about certain hawkish stances he took in his Bush years.</p>
<p>If many were curious about the precise nature of Frum’s working political philosophy toward the end of the Obama administration, those questions would soon be erased. Not long after Donald Trump walked down that escalator in June 2015 and announced he was running for president of the United States, Frum initiated his impassioned, comprehensive, and nearly all-consuming exploration of his contempt for the man who, he tweeted two years later, was “the worst human being ever to enter the presidency, and I include all the slaveholders.”</p>
<p>The depth of his investigation into the amorality of not just Trump but Trumpism has clarified and intensified his sense of what politics ought to be about. It has produced some of his best and most compelling writing. It also may have consigned him to post-Trump irrelevance within the Republican Party. </p>
<p>In a seminal essay in <em>The Atlantic</em>, published on May 31, 2016, titled “The Seven Broken Guardrails of Democracy,” Frum outlined his major oppositional stand to Trump, who had then all but secured the Republican nomination. Read today, the essay is notable for its fury and predictive accuracy. “Here’s the part of the 2016 story that will be hardest to explain after it’s all over,” Frum wrote. “Trump did not deceive anyone&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;all of them knew, by the time they made their decisions, that Trump lied all the time, about everything. They knew that Trump was ignorant, and coarse, and boastful, and cruel. They knew he habitually sympathized with dictators and kleptocrats&mdash;and that his instinct when confronted with criticism of himself was to attack, vilify, and suppress. They knew his disrespect for women, the disabled, and ethnic and religious minorities. They knew that he wished to unravel NATO and other U.S.-led alliances, and that he speculated aloud about partial default on American financial obligations. None of that dissuaded or deterred them.”</p>
<p>He went on to describe it as baffling and sinister that any of his conservative friends were even considering voting for Trump, let alone publicly going over to the dark side, yet many did. “Whatever the outcome in November,” he wrote, “conservatives and Republicans will have brought a catastrophe upon themselves, in violation of their own stated principles and best judgment.”</p>
<p>It was the start of what has become the overriding theme of Frum’s work, in articles and books, over the last four years and counting: to detail both the ways in which Donald Trump is individually corrupt and the ways in which Trumpism has peeled back the dressing to reveal the suppurating sore that is the Republican Party. </p>
<p>Ross Douthat is a columnist with the <em>New York Times</em> and, in many ways, may be his generation’s Frum&mdash;an idealist trying to think his way toward a refreshed classical conservatism. He told me by phone earlier this summer that he’d been reading and learning from Frum since <em>Dead Right</em>, though he did not always agree with him. Right from the start, Douthat said, Frum saw Trump as an urgent threat and argued that working with him, attempting the incrementalism of reforming the man by degrees, was not going to save the party. “I thought some of his attacks on the GOP were over the top or counterproductive,” said Douthat. “He thought that the infrastructure of conservatism was rotten and you couldn’t just renew it from within. You had to confront the rot. I think the rise and success of Donald Trump suggests that David was more right about the scale of the rot than we were.”</p>
<p>Frum has written hundreds of thousands of words since his “Guardrails” essay, but what unites them all is how deeply offended he is by Trump. There is a faint melancholy there, a wish for the good old days when people could argue about ideas and rail against the injustices of this or that policy as opposed to having to continuously document the race to the bottom. There are no high roads or low roads. Every road leads to Trump, and all are cratered, muddy, dangerous thoroughfares to a destination not worth getting to. His first book devoted to the president, 2018’s <em>Trumpocracy</em>, was essentially an analysis of how Trump happened. <em>Trumpocalypse</em>, published this May, is a strategy for erasing the stain. Frum seems to be feeling the stress: he wrote wearily in <em>Trumpocalypse</em> that “we have to believe this shameful episode will end soon&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;Over the past four years, I have thought and spoken and written about Donald Trump almost more than I can bear.” </p>
<p>Not everyone has been particularly sympathetic. William Voegeli, a senior editor of the <em>Claremont Review of Books</em> and noted conservative commentator, told me that, “at some point, if you want followers, if you want somebody, somewhere, to be on your side, then you have to make clear what that side is. David has been better, more vigorous about what he’s against than what he’s for. There are just so many ways that even a gifted writer can say Donald Trump is a bad president. I’ve found it harder and harder to figure out where David actually stands, if indeed he still considers himself a conservative.”</p>
<p>That’s a polite way of saying what others are saying less politely. Many on the hard right loathe Frum, partly for the content of his criticism and partly because he broke ranks. Fox News host Greg Gutfeld, in a June tweet, wrote, “Frum woke one day, a zero; a failed, bitter scold whose desire to be loved thwarted by events. now, all he does is fume. thinkers find him sad &amp; discuss it openly. He’s the old neighbor who shouts thru the walls cuz his life, and yours, passed him by.” Tucker Carlson, also of Fox, announced on air: “The awfulness of David Frum may be the only thing the left and right agree on in this country.” (He’s not wrong. From a review of <em>Trumpocracy</em> in socialist magazine <em>Jacobin</em>: “as an account of how and why Trump came to be, let alone what can be done to resist him, <em>Trumpocracy</em> fails in almost every respect&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;the hypocrisy of its author proves impossible to ignore.”) </p>
<p>“I think he’s definitely a man without a home,” Douthat told me. “He’s more alienated from what conservatism is right now than I am and than a lot of people who opposed Trump in 2016 but who have stayed squarely on the right are. There’s definitely a form of liberalism that he would be totally comfortable in. It’s just unclear whether it exists as a force within liberalism today. I think,” Douthat concluded, “that David is one of the more betwixt-and-between figures.”</p>
<p>Around the same time that Frum squared off against Bannon at the 2018 Munk Debate, he published an essay in <em>The Atlantic</em>, titled “The Republican Party Needs to Embrace Liberalism,” in which he called for a new brand of Republicanism. “In a democratic society, conservatism and liberalism are not really opposites. They are different facets of the common democratic creed,” he wrote. “What conservatives are conserving, after all, is a liberal order.” He expanded upon those comments during one of our conversations. “In the North American context,” he said, “it’s not like conservatives are conserving the Inquisition. They’re not conserving kingship. The conservatives are part of a liberal tradition in North America.”</p>
<p>At one point near the end of our communications, I asked him whether, given the overall tenor of his policy positions, it had ever occurred to him that he might be a liberal stuck in the body of a conservative. </p>
<p>He did not respond.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">s we move toward</span> November 3, Frum does not believe Trump has a chance of winning, but that doesn’t mean he thinks the election will be peaceful. “It’s going to be a very scary and unstable time,” he said. “And, of course, it doesn’t end in November. We’re not safe until January. He will try to cause as much chaos as he can on his way to losing, and then after he loses, he will pardon criminal associates, he will try to pardon himself, he will move money to himself, and he will try to leave behind as poisoned an environment as possible.”</p>
<p>But what if he wins? I asked. What if he legally, legitimately wins? Then it’s full crisis mode, Frum said, not just for America but for the world. “Scorched earth. My God, it’ll be gruesome. It’ll be a sign that the American democratic system has been truly corrupted because, if he wins, he will win despite a big majority of the country being against him. So it will be a win either through massive voter suppression or a massively unfair outcome in the electoral college. How do you even talk about this being a democratic system of government anymore?”</p>
<p>I put it to Frum that, though he is considered a key conservative thinker, he might actually be more on the outside than he’s ever been. The blunt reality is that, as a former warmonger, he will never be embraced by the left, and he is now loathed by the right as an apostate. There is no centre. </p>
<p>“I think I’m a pessimist by temperament and an optimist by opinion,” he told me. “Or at least I try to be. And it is probably true that my first assessment of any situation is the pessimistic one, and then I ask myself what my father would say, and then I try to talk myself into the more optimistic view.” Despite everything, he actually feels quite good about the world these days, mostly because, he explained, the various upheavals have instigated “movements of social and moral change, outside the political system, outside the party system, that I think are inspiring people to be better people.”</p>
<p>I asked him what he actually thought he was achieving by criticizing his party and calling out the hollowness of its leadership, not just in the Trump years but effectively since the twilight of the second Bush term. What’s the plan, the point, the endgame? Surely the goal is not to seek alienation from every point on the political compass, not to mention a chunk of his personal and professional peer group. He thought about that for a minute. </p>
<p>“Life is like a hike through a really overgrown trail, and you’re so busy not falling off the cliff, so busy pushing aside the branches. But, every once in a while, there’s a break, and you get a wider vista. I remember Bill Buckley gave an interview in 1970,” he said of the leading thinker who often railed against the anti-intellectual strain of the Republican Party, “in which somebody asked him, What do you think you’re doing? And he said, I’m trying to maintain a landing strip in the jungle. Someday the planes will appear, and we’ll be waiting for them.” Frum went on to describe a recent family dinner where his career choices were a topic. “We were talking about some of our friends who have gone over to the Fox News side. And there’s a lot of money to be made over there. I was being teased, ‘Are you quite sure about all of this?’ Part of it is my nature: I just don’t think it’s in me to have done that.” </p>
<p>I asked him if he thought his mother would have respected him if he’d made that leap.</p>
<p>“No, she would not,” he said immediately. “Boy, would she not have.”</p>
<p>Maybe the long game, then, is the only one left to play, the only one that might someday put Frum and his philosophy back at the heart of the matter. I asked him if he ever saw himself working in government again. “I don’t think about it,” he said. “Over the past twenty years, I’ve come to use the word <em>useful</em> as a compliment more and more often. I want to be useful. I think it’s also that I have a sense of other periods of my life when I did things that were not useful.” He thought about it for a second longer. “And I’ve got a kind of karmic debt to the universe that has to be paid back.”</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/david-frum-fights-the-right/">David Frum Fights the Right</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p>We’d come prepared for this moment. In our bags, there were printed copies of the Federal Election Commission regulations, which grant “foreign nationals” the right to volunteer on campaigns in the United States.</p>
<p>The border guard flipped through our passports and glanced at each of our faces. “I didn’t know so many Canadians come down for a primary,” she said.</p>
<ul class="related">
<li><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/left-out/">We Need a Bernie Sanders of Our Own</a></li>
<li><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/im-part-of-the-0-1-percent-and-i-want-a-wealth-tax/">I&#8217;m Part of the 0.1 Percent and I Want a Wealth Tax</a></li>

</ul>
<p>“A lot this year?” I asked from the backseat.</p>
<p>“Yup.” She handed back the passports and waved us through. “Good luck!”</p>
<p>Inside the car, everyone exhaled. We pointed ourselves in the direction of New Hampshire, turned up Billy Bragg on the stereo, and steeled ourselves for the next part of our trip: helping get Senator Bernie Sanders nominated as the next presidential candidate of the US Democratic Party.</p>
<p>It was our “Bernie Journey,” the official campaign name for out-of-staters travelling to the early primaries and caucuses that would set the tone of the leadership race. For a few long days in mid-February, we would slog through slush and slide over ice in the foggy eastern state, knocking on doors as part of a massive grassroots operation. </p>
<p>Why were we here? No one else was offering a convincing answer for how to turn the tide of right-wing ascendance in American politics. No one else was making the case not merely for tinkering with a rotten system but for an overhaul that would include major new universal social programs, a redistribution of America’s oligarchic wealth, and a civilizational mission to tackle the climate crisis. And no one else was making it clear that any politician with a hope in hell of implementing this agenda could not merely rely on the powers of the White House but would need to be backed up by a noisy movement outside Washington.</p>
<p>Like any group of nerdy left-wingers, we had already debated and discussed the most apt historical analogy for our effort: the Spanish Civil War, in the 1930s, when that country’s fate teetered between the global forces of reactionary fascism and social liberation. Back then, more than a thousand Canadians had been inspired to defend the beleaguered republic, just as the United States was now attracting droves of Canadian volunteers, albeit nonviolent ones. </p>
<p>It was hard to dispute that, if Sanders won the chance to take on President Donald Trump, the autumn US election would entail similar stakes: a crossroads between barbarism and socialism, but this time with planetary repercussions. If Trump triumphed again, the world, we believed, was assured more war, waves of emboldened racism, and escalating climate breakdown. But, if Trump could be defeated by Sanders, the United States might become a catalyst for change well beyond its borders.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he morning after</span>, the nine of us who had made the trip from Montreal, Ottawa, and Halifax were eating breakfast and warming up by a fire in the living room of Tal and Heidi, our Bernie Journey hosts.</p>
<p>Their house, in Nelson, a small forested town, was among scores of organizing outposts that were part of a network of seventeen New Hampshire field offices run by more than 150 campaign staffers. A pine tree next to the fireplace, christened the “Bernie tree,” was weighed down with Christmas ornaments and political pamphlets. A basket spilled over with hand-warmer packs, stylus pens for cellphones, and surprisingly, golf balls—handy for door knocking while wearing gloves in minus-fifteen-degree weather.</p>
<p>Tal posed a time-honoured precanvassing motivator: he asked us all to name one thing that excited us about the prospect of a Bernie Sanders presidency. Michael, who had recently dropped out of university after being hit by a car a few months earlier, described the accident that gave him a concussion and a fractured rib. He wanted Americans to have the kind of health care he had received, free of charge, which Sanders’s Medicare for All would ensure. Maryse, a lawyer, was hopeful that Sanders might provide Canadian politics with a bold model for taking on the establishment. Jacob, a student and former page in the House of Commons, believed Sanders was the only candidate with a truly serious climate plan. Eddy, a junior analyst, saw him as a politician who had been on the “right side of history” for forty years. Stephanie, an Ottawa city councillor assistant, believed it was long past time for a socialist to occupy the White House.</p>
<p>Did we have any concerns about intervening in US political affairs? Tal asked. When I had first seen our friend Miles’s Facebook post inviting others to join him on the trip to New Hampshire, I was reminded of something author Arundhati Roy had once said. I quoted it aloud to the group.</p>
<p>“Some of you will think it bad manners for a person like me, officially entered in the Big Book of Modern Nations as an ‘Indian citizen,’ to come here and criticize the US government,” Roy had acknowledged in a 2003 New York speech. “But, when a country ceases to be merely a country and becomes an empire, then the scale of operations changes dramatically. So may I clarify that tonight I speak as a subject of the American empire?” </p>
<p>Everyone in the room nodded. No feature of the US empire implicated us more than the imposing obstacle it posed to global climate action. It is one of the largest carbon emitters, a major player in the expansion of fossil fuel extraction, and currently governed by a president who has torn up the 2015 Paris climate agreement, a pact that would have afforded a chance of international cooperation. The election of Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, promised a complete reversal. </p>
<p>Sanders is backing a Green New Deal that would devote an astounding $16.3 trillion to weaning the US economy off of fossil fuels, developing sustainable agriculture, building out public transit, and creating an estimated 20 million jobs. It was the best plan for meeting the terms of the landmark 2018 UN climate report, which concluded that keeping global warming to safe levels within the next decade required “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.” </p>
<p>“Bernie offers the last, best chance of saving the planet,” Jacob said, a talking point he would repeat any chance he got over the course of our trip&mdash;at doorsteps, in convenience stores, and to grannies we encountered at Little Miss Sophie’s diner in Rochester. </p>
<p>What he said wasn’t really an exaggeration. If Sanders didn’t win the presidency, it was hard to imagine mounting the kind of ambitious policies, starting in the United States and then rippling across the world, that could stave off ecological catastrophe in the narrow window of time we had left. In this light, one could suggest it was dangerously bad manners to <em>not</em> try to influence the US election.</p>
<p>This was hardly a fringe perspective within Canada. These young activists may have had a higher level of commitment—taking vacation or unpaid time off from their jobs to canvass in New Hampshire&mdash;but they weren’t alone in their views. A 2016 poll found that, among respondents from nine countries, Canadians were the only ones who picked Bernie Sanders as their preferred US President. (A majority of respondents from Germany, France, Japan, and Australia went for Hillary Clinton.)</p>
<p>A big part of Sanders’s appeal in Canada lies in how he’s channelled anger at the establishment. “If there is going to be class warfare in this country,” he has repeated on the campaign trail and on social media, “it’s time that the working class of this country won that war.” Is it any wonder this dishevelled avatar of class animus has resonated in Canada when, according to a recent Ipsos poll, 67 percent of people here believe the “economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful”? Despite so many being entirely correct in this sentiment, it has found little reflection in the rhetoric or policies of their most obvious potential vehicle, the New Democratic Party. </p>
<p>Most of the young Canadians on our Bernie Journey had campaigned, without much excitement, for <span class="smallcaps">NDP</span> candidates (with a rare exception being Ontario <span class="smallcaps">MPP</span> Joel Harden, a fiery and energetic socialist who had endorsed the Leap Manifesto, the Canadian precursor to the Green New Deal). The <span class="smallcaps">NDP</span>’s climate plan, for instance, involved $15 billion, piddling compared to the transformative plan Sanders envisioned. But, if they were hitting walls at home, these activists felt that, if they could help Sanders win abroad, his political model might gain undeniable validity and even unstoppable momentum at home in Canada.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he man</span> opened his front door shirtless, cradling a baby in one arm. Michael and I were canvassing in the town of Antrim, within view of a large white clapboard Baptist church.</p>
<p>“For Bernie? Let me come outside.”</p>
<p>He had voted for Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary but was wondering if, this year, the socialist label would hurt his chances.</p>
<p>“And I love his policies, like Medicare for All, but can it be done? I really don’t think so.” </p>
<p>“We’re from Canada, so we know it can,” we replied in unison.</p>
<p>He eyed us closely.</p>
<p>At door after door, we were a gentle counter-example to the battered political expectations Americans had long grown accustomed to. Frequently admitting we were Canadians, we made the case that more vibrant social programs, like health care, were entirely feasible and could be paid for simply by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. (Although, if Sanders’s Medicare for All is passed, it will provide coverage&mdash;including dental and vision care, prescription drugs, and rehabilitative services&mdash;that is far more comprehensive than what we currently have in Canada.)</p>
<p>Miles, the Ottawa municipal worker who had organized the Bernie Journey, had his own favourite follow-up to questions about health care at the doorstep. He told people that the American Medical Association, a powerful physician’s lobby group, had gone to Saskatchewan in the 1960s to spread disinformation and campaign against the implementation of Tommy Douglas’s universal health care proposal. “Now we’re here, returning the favour,” Miles would say.</p>
<p>Americans in New Hampshire might have been hearing such things a lot; I bumped into a great many Canadians canvassing in the state.</p>
<p>At the press table for a rally with Sanders on the weekend, a press officer mischievously smiled and told me her usual job was doing media relations for the Ottawa Senators. A young student from Calgary, whom I met in line, had never been involved in any activism in Canada but had been inspired to fly down to Iowa, then New Hampshire. And several more groups of Canadians had driven across the border through the largest blizzard of the winter to volunteer. (The Sanders campaign says it doesn’t keep data on how many Canadians have been involved.)</p>
<p>Back home in Canada, groups in several cities&mdash;I was able to confirm them in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, and Vancouver&mdash;were organizing phone and texting operations for Sanders. One friend had sent off more than 60,000 texts using technology that facilitates mass texting.</p>
<p>According to a phone-banking organizer in Toronto, there was one main reason why more Canadians weren’t getting involved: most of his friends simply didn’t know that it was legal.</p>
<p>In New Hampshire, Canadians were among the 14,000 volunteers knocking on doors. On the Saturday that we were there, the campaign visited 150,000 households, a staggering 25 percent of all residences in the entire state.</p>
<p>It was one sign of the grassroots enthusiasm behind Sanders, who has received donations from more than 1.5 million Americans, for an average contribution of $18. In visualizations done by the <em>New York Times</em> of each of the candidate’s fundraising last August, Sanders’s haul was so dominant in every part of the country that the outlet was forced to create a second map just to show what other candidates had raised.</p>
<p>It is illegal, however, for Canadians to donate to the campaign, and we are also forbidden from purchasing any merchandise. At a large rally in a Durham university hockey arena, we gazed longingly at Bernie T-shirts and posters stacked on the tables outside. We would have to settle for free buttons.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he lead singer</span> on stage&mdash;a ball of energy, platinum hair, and emo pouts and scowls&mdash;had just destroyed my eardrums and was now exhorting the crowd to vote for Bernie Sanders the following day. As glam-rock band Sunflower Bean finished its set, the college arena continued filling up to near-maximum capacity. More than 7,000 cheering people were anticipating, by left-wing standards, a star-studded night: Cornel West, Cynthia Nixon, Nina Turner, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and garage-rock sensation the Strokes.</p>
<p>I watched the proceedings from the media section, on the bleachers across from the stage, while my Canadian friends tried to make their way into the crowd at rink-level below. Banners featuring Bernie Sanders’s main campaign slogan&mdash;“Not me, us”&mdash;hung from every corner of the arena. The Jumbotron flashed a message&mdash;#BernieBeatsTrump&mdash;that canvassers had been instructed to drum home at the doors that week. In national polls, Sanders outperformed nearly all other Democratic candidates against the incumbent president. And this boisterous arena was yet another confirmation of the energy inspired by Sanders, the kind needed to get voters out in November.</p>
<p>I’ve been to electrifying rallies in my lifetime&mdash;joining in giant round dances during the Idle No More movement or listening to eloquent Quebec student-leaders speak to a crowd of tens of thousands&mdash;but I had never seen anything like this put on by an insurgent candidate for a political party.</p>
<p>Former state senator Nina Turner bounded up and down the stage in a cheetah-print dress, boosting “a champion who says they are going to war against white supremacy.” Philosopher Cornel West followed up with his signature oration, arms gesticulating about the “neo-fascist gangster in the White House.” The largest cheers I heard were reserved for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who went through a list of reasons she supported Sanders. “Who stood up for women and gender nonconforming people’s right to choose in the 1990s, when it was unpopular? Bernie Sanders.”</p>
<p>These were personalities, but they weren’t practising the personality politics that had marked the US Democratic Party for a generation&mdash;a politics of procorporate policies with a shiny patina of social progressivism. The figures on stage were, instead, part of a presidential campaign being built on a multiracial, working-class coalition.</p>
<p>By the time Sanders reached the stage, the crowd buzzed with overstimulation. It hardly mattered that he was delivering the same message he had given all week. “We are a movement to create the economy and government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent&mdash;one that stands up to Wall Street and their greed, stands up to the insurance and drug companies and fossil fuel industry, stands up to the military-industrial complex and their endless wars, stands up to the prison-industrial complex, and stands up to the whole damn 1 percent.”</p>
<p>The crowd roared its approval.</p>
<p>After he had been ignored or dismissed for most of the campaign, it was proving harder and harder to avoid the fact that Sanders had generated huge momentum behind this agenda. His primary opponents, the Democratic establishment, and the corporate media were now shifting toward full-fledged attacks: panicked slights by Hillary Clinton that “no one likes him,” the accusation&mdash;which Sanders vehemently denies&mdash;that he had told Elizabeth Warren a woman couldn’t become president (he says he even “deferred” to Warren in 2015 and only jumped into the 2016 race when she decided not to run), and concern-trolling about his electability from the likes of Republican David Frum. For Sanders, only a broad and energetic movement&mdash;with a candidate serving as mere organizer-in-chief&mdash;could generate a political revolution big enough to change life for the overwhelming majority of people. And, despite his establishment detractors, it seemed like that movement was coalescing.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">E</span><span class="smallcaps">arlier that night</span>, in a lineup outside that circled around the campus for more than a kilometre, we had been approached by a peppy man in his twenties passing out flyers for Democratic candidate Andrew Yang.</p>
<p>“Oh, we can’t vote,” we told him. “We’re just down from Canada to volunteer for Bernie.”</p>
<p>His arms fell to his side, and he immediately turned downcast. </p>
<p>“What chance do we have,” he sighed, “if Bernie is inspiring people to come from Canada?”</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/my-weekend-canvassing-for-bernie/">My Weekend Canvassing for Bernie</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>
