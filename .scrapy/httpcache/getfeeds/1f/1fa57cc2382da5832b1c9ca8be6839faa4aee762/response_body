The thing you throw on over nothing else because it reduces you to a shapeless blob, an impenetrable mass devoid of emotion, shape, or gender? That’s the dysphoria hoodie, something that hides your body and gender expression from wandering&mdash;and potentially misunderstanding&mdash;eyes. </p>
<p>It’s an item born more for function than fashion, one that lacks any room for personal style or expression. Yet it’s been adopted en masse by mainstream brands looking to appeal to gender-ambiguous shoppers. Look at the “gender-neutral” lines of mainstream mall brands like Old Navy, Roots, and H&#038;M and you’ll find a lot of dysphoria hoodies&mdash;items meant to affirm but seemingly designed to avoid any sense of silhouette, pattern, or colour. Based off the offerings of most mainstream apparel brands, you’d think “gender-free” was synonymous with no fun&mdash;ironic considering many of us who identify outside the gender binary often present ourselves in fruity and extra ways. Last year, a set of button-ups from Old Navy were shared on Twitter (now X) among transmasculine folks, and one of the shirts had a vibrant orange print&mdash;and I do mean orange as in the fruit.</p>
<p>For the bottom line of these brands, launching so-called “gender-neutral” lines of hoodies and sweatpants makes sense. A <a href="https://www.theindustry.fashion/gen-z-fashion-report-shows-65-want-gender-neutral-search-option-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2022 Unidays survey</a> found that 65 percent of Gen Z respondents believe brands should provide gender-neutral clothing. Non-binary and trans folks are another market to target, as are cis people looking for fits or styles outside of traditionally “gendered” silhouettes, and mass-producing shapeless fabric blobs is easy enough. But it also means pretty much every other clothing item&mdash;jeans, dresses, shirts, pants, and more&mdash;remains in the clutches of the gender binary.</p>

</ul>
<p>As a non-binary person, I find it unfortunate to see the only clothes marketed to me come from the haute couture dysphoria hoodie line. Maybe I, an ostensibly gender-neutral person, want to wear hard pants or shirts or dresses or literally anything besides androgynous, shapeless hoodies. Just because something isn’t explicitly for “men” or “women” doesn’t mean it has to be boring as sin. I’m definitely in the “dismantle the gender binary” camp, and a good place to start would be imagining more clothing sections than what we’ve got now: “men,” &#8220;women,” and “hoodies.” </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t wasn’t always</span> like this. Our modern conception of gender and clothing is a relatively recent development in the grand scheme of history. </p>
<p>For much of human existence, clothes were largely made to keep people warm and covered up. As style evolved in the late Middle Ages, it actually became in vogue for men in Europe to wear tights to accentuate the legs. Pants became masculine attire only in the sixteenth century; previously, both men and women wore what modern people would call skirts and dresses. Over time, clothing started to be used primarily to distinguish between men and women rather than to express social position.</p>
<p>But the modern fashion industry has periodically leaned toward androgyny. In the 1960s, models like Twiggy pioneered a hyper-thin, teenage-bodied, short-haired version of feminine androgyny. The “unisex” movement of 1968 saw runway designers imagine a genderless world of sleek silhouettes. In recent years, celebrities like Billy Porter and Harry Styles have donned dresses on magazine covers and red carpets. </p>
<p>But what Styles wears on the cover of <em>Vogue</em> is very different from what’s typically marketed as unisex clothing. According to the 2021 census, one in 300 people in Canada aged fifteen and older identified themselves as transgender or non-binary. Two-thirds of those respondents were under the age of thirty-five&mdash;which could indicate that age group is increasingly embracing fluid definitions of gender. And that doesn’t include the folks who identify as cis and are looking for gender-diverse fashion&mdash;I’ve commiserated with many cis butch lesbians about the lack of accessible “men’s” pants for our body types. The need to move beyond today’s potato-sack-esque offerings is clear.   </p>
<p>Marie-Eve Faust, a professor at the Université du Québec à Montréal who specializes in fashion management, sizing, and sustainability, says there’s an ease to mass-producing for the familiar “male” or “female” silhouette with little variation. Since many clothing brands are resistant to trying anything that could impact their bottom lines, they’re more likely to stick to what they know. </p>
<p>“If you’re doing garments for women, and you know that this is for one specific target market, it’s easier because your target is well defined,” Faust says. “Whereas if everyone moves towards having gender-neutral [clothes], you’re not having your specific target market to yourself.”</p>
<p>Even companies that are trying to move away from the binary haven’t been able to include everyone. Brands like Both&#038; or Wildfang, which market masculine styles of clothing to folks who don’t have traditionally cis male bodies, are attempting to fill the gap of catering “male” clothing to a so-called “female silhouette” by selling button-up shirts that don’t ride up over wider hips, or pants with wider waist measurements proportional to shorter inseams. </p>
<p>But what does it mean to have an “AFAB” (assigned female at birth) body, as Both&#038; suggests is its target audience? Is it me: five feet six, 210 pounds, a thirty-six-inch waist, and a surgically flattened chest, plus nearly two years on gender-affirming hormone therapy? Is it my five-foot-nine cisgender girlfriend? Or is it a non-binary pal who’s five feet tall and wears a 4X in “women’s” pants? Ostensibly, we are all “AFAB,” but that does little to help categorize us or guarantee that the brand’s clothing will fit any of us.</p>
<p>It’s a problem I encounter in my endless search for pants. At five feet six, I land on the lower end of “men’s” pant inseams. But my wider hips mean I hit the upper end of waist sizes. Finding affordable options that fit me both ways is essentially impossible, so I often pay extra to get my jeans hemmed.</p>
<p>And notably, there’s an even greater lack of inclusive fashion catered to transfeminine folks or cis men looking for feminine clothes. My struggle to find short king pants is hard, but it might be even harder for someone with broad shoulders to find a bra that fits. And while transmasculine folks can dip into boys sizing for our shoes, drag queens can attest to the challenge in finding a size fourteen high heel. This discrepancy can likely be chalked up to misogyny: shifting toward the masculine end of the spectrum is acceptable, but God forbid someone’s masculinity should be threatened by a desire to be more feminine. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">hese struggles are</span> at the heart of a concerted push to show brands that there is a market outside of those “traditional”&mdash;and often hyper-thin&mdash;silhouettes in mainstream fashion. Queer and trans folks looking for accessible and size-inclusive clothing outside of the gender binary could be an untapped market and money-making potential for mainstream brands. But outside of the financial benefits, giving people what they actually want and need should be motivation enough.</p>
<p>In 2021, Samuel Braemer co-founded Transforming Style, a personal styling and shopping service targeted at LGBTQ2+ folks, as a way to help them navigate the economic and emotional barriers of the fashion world. They help clients through virtual consultations and in-person shopping, regardless of their gender. </p>
<p>The team recently worked with a thirteen-year-old trans girl in Calgary to help craft a wardrobe for her first time at public school after being home-schooled her whole life. </p>
<p>“We worked with her and her parents to provide her with a wardrobe representative of herself,” he said. “A couple of weeks later, her mum sent us an email with photos of her and said that it was life changing and now she sees herself reflected in the mirror.”</p>
<p>Braemer says personal shopping can be helpful as a support for folks looking to brave in-person shopping.</p>
<p>“It can be very overwhelming to go into a big-box store, a boutique, you know, a mall to shop for your true self,” he says. “The categorization can be overwhelming when it&#8217;s categorized by gender.”</p>
<p>An easy answer to the problem of categorization is to mass-produce dysphoria hoodies. But a better solution is doing away with categories altogether by designing clothes that fit a variety of bodies rather than imposing a third “gender-neutral” categorization on consumers. </p>
<p>Lydia Okello, a non-binary model, writer, and content creator who focuses on fat-centred fashion and queerness, says they hope for a world where you can walk into a mainstream retail store and see clothing sorted by style and sizing instead of gender. </p>
<p>“I don’t think that it helps anyone shop better,” they say. “I think it’s just prescribing gender to a piece of clothing that is inanimate and has no gender prescribed.”</p>
<p>They believe that de-gendering fashion will not only provide more space for trans and non-binary folks but also encourage people who haven’t experimented with fashion or expression to do so. Maybe a big cis guy looking for something cozy to wear at home would buy a caftan if it came in his size and wasn’t segregated in the “women’s” section. Maybe more cis women would feel free to experiment outside of traditionally feminine styles if more masculine clothes were accessible to them. </p>
<p>“My dream is a landscape in which people don’t feel afraid to venture out of their usual visual selection,” Okello says. “I think that would be a really exciting world to live in.”</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/gender-neutral-clothing/">What “Gender-Neutral” Fashion Gets Wrong</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

There would be a shuffling of papers, and the officer might inform me about an assault, a break-in, an arrest, or a charge.</p>
<p>It was a quick and easy way to provide fodder for the newspaper, and in those days, it didn’t even occur to reporters to question the validity of any of the information offered. Nor did our editors ever suggest we try to get the perspective of the person charged before running their name in the paper.</p>
<p>Police were considered an authoritative source, worthy of trust and able to supply unchallenged facts about everything from minor incidents to shootings and murders. To a large extent, this remains true today. Crime news has been a staple of the media for centuries. It’s seen as urgent and entertaining, something everyone will want to read. Even the smallest newsrooms are guaranteed a reliable stream of stories from their police calls, and many local news outlets traditionally assign a reporter exclusively to the police beat. A US study once found that nearly 14 percent of all full-time reporters said they covered crime or police. </p>

<p>Imagine, then, what a police reporter would have concluded after reading the following press release from the Minneapolis Police Department. </p>
<blockquote><p>MAN DIES AFTER MEDICAL INCIDENT DURING POLICE INTERACTION</p>
<p>May 25, 2020 (MINNEAPOLIS) On Monday evening, shortly after 8:00 pm, officers from the Minneapolis Police Department responded to the 3700 block of Chicago Avenue South on a report of a forgery in progress. Officers were advised that the suspect was sitting on top of a blue car and appeared to be under the influence. Two officers arrived and located the suspect, a male believed to be in his 40s, in his car. He was ordered to step from his car. After he got out, he physically resisted officers. Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress.</p>
<p>Officers called for an ambulance. He was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center by ambulance where he died a short time later.<br />
At no time were weapons of any type used by anyone involved in this incident.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has been called in to investigate this incident at the request of the Minneapolis Police Department.</p>
<p>No officers were injured in the incident. </p></blockquote>
<p>The headline of this police communication might just as well have read: “Nothing to see here, folks. Move along.” Police officers were merely detaining someone in a forgery case. They noticed he was in medical distress and helpfully called an ambulance. Unfortunately, he died, though thankfully no officers were injured in the process. No weapons “of any type” were used in this incident.</p>
<p>Based on this press release, it’s unlikely this would have even made the local news. Instead, the murder of George Floyd triggered worldwide protests and a racial reckoning in society that continues to reverberate far beyond Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the truth, seventeen-year-old Darnella Frazier captured the scene on her phone and posted it online for the world to see. It shows all the things the Minneapolis Police Department’s press release carefully omits: that a police officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for nine minutes and twenty-nine seconds; that Floyd repeatedly protested he couldn’t breathe; that other officers stood by and didn’t do anything. The press statement didn’t just lie by omitting crucial evidence. It also misrepresented the sequence of events, pretending that Floyd was in medical distress as he was being handcuffed when the police themselves were the cause of his distress. It was an attempt to dupe the media, and it might have worked if not for the video evidence of what actually happened.</p>
<p>Such blatant misrepresentation of facts is common in police reports, especially where police misconduct is a factor. When Los Angeles police infamously brutalized Rodney King in 1991, they wrote reports claiming he had suffered only minor cuts and scrapes. In 2020, when police shot and killed an innocent Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, officers were charged with fabricating evidence to justify a “no knock” warrant and conspiring to cover up the truth.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n Canada,</span> police departments have been known to jump to the defence of officers who shoot suspects—before independent investigations have even begun. Perhaps the most famous example was the shooting of Indigenous leader J.&thinsp;J. Harper in Winnipeg in 1988. Harper was misidentified as a suspect in a crime, confronted by police officer Robert Cross, and then shot to death. Within two days, Winnipeg’s police chief exonerated Cross, blamed Harper for the events, and declared racism was not a factor in what happened. But Winnipeg’s Indigenous community was outraged, and the case was soon investigated intensively by Manitoba’s Aboriginal Justice Inquiry.</p>
<p>It concluded that Harper’s detention was inappropriate, that Cross had altered his story, and that an “official version” was concocted by police to mask what had really happened. The inquiry concluded it was Cross, through his unnecessary approach and inappropriate attempt to detain Harper, who set in motion the events that resulted in Harper’s death. It also said racism played a part in what happened. More broadly, the inquiry concluded that the Harper killing was just one example of a wider problem. “The justice system has failed Manitoba’s Aboriginal people on a massive scale.” </p>
<p>Thomas Nolan, a former Boston police lieutenant who became an academic, says he used to coach officers on how to frame their reports to paint victims as aggressors and themselves as valiant defenders of the law. Police routinely use contrived forms of expression when communicating with the media. They might describe “a male suspect exiting his vehicle” or a car that is “blue in colour.” But when describing serious matters, they have invented legalistic-sounding euphemisms like “officer-involved shooting” and “police interaction,” designed to obscure the truth. According to police press releases, officers never shoot people. At the most, they might “discharge their weapons,” which then strike individuals. Nolan says this is a deliberate strategy:</p>
<blockquote><p>This stilted, imprecise “legalese” is the commonly used verbiage found in the police lexicon and forms the base of the narrative that police use throughout the United States. The purpose of the narrative is ultimately to exculpate the police from any blame or allegation that the use of force being described was unnecessary, inappropriate, excessive, or unlawful. </p></blockquote>
<p>I cringe whenever I hear or read these manufactured phrases pop up in media reports, as they frequently do. It’s a signal the reporter is being manipulated. If police have shot and killed someone, it’s pure doublespeak to refer to the incident as an “interaction.”</p>
<p>Deception and lying aren’t just restricted to communication with the media. They often continue into the courts. In 2012, <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/police-who-lie-how-officers-thwart-justice-with-false-testimony/article_668c2250-73c0-5b12-8a3a-23446baad641.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an investigation by the <em>Toronto Star</em></a> found more than 100 cases across Canada where police used illegal techniques, excessive force, and racial profiling and then covered it up with false testimony in court. The newspaper found that a common technique would be for police to assault a suspect and then begin their cover-up by charging their victim with assault and obstructing justice. In reviewing court transcripts of cases where police lied, the <em>Star</em> made note of words judges used to describe their evidence: “lie,” “fabricate,” “evasive,” “absurd,” “ridiculous,” “subversive,” “disturbing,” and “pure fiction.” </p>
<p>The <em>Star</em> also noted that many officers who were accused of lying by judges never faced any consequences. Some were identified as repeat offenders. In many cases, the lying wasn’t reported to the internal discipline divisions of police departments, while other police forces seemed unconcerned by the findings. A spokesperson for the Toronto police told the newspaper its investigation couldn’t be taken seriously since many of the judicial statements were “throwaway comments” of little value. “A judge can comment on anything he or she wishes. Such comment, however, does not amount to a finding of guilt,” the spokesperson said. “The criminal justice system works on evidence, on examination, cross-examination, and decision. It does not work on throwaway comments unsupported by evidence.” </p>
<p>Systematic lying in court is so common in the United States that officers have coined a term for it: testilying. A New York mayoral commission investigating police in the mid-1990s found that officers often perjured themselves on the witness stand. “Perjury is perhaps the most widespread form of police wrongdoing facing today’s criminal justice system,” the report said.</p>
<p>A quarter of a century later, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/nyregion/testilying-police-perjury-new-york.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the <em>New York Times</em> revisited the issue</a> to see if anything had changed. It found lying in court was a recurring problem. Similarly, a <em><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2019/04/24/usa-today-revealing-misconduct-records-police-cops/3223984002/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">USA Today</a></em> investigation in 2019 collated police misconduct records over ten years. It found 2,227 instances of perjury, tampering with evidence or witnesses, or falsifying reports. </p>
<p>For people who work in the criminal justice system, the findings of these media investigations do not come as a great surprise. Toronto criminal lawyer Reid Rusonik <a href="https://www.thestar.com/opinion/canadians-have-a-right-to-expect-police-to-tell-the-truth-all-the-time/article_6c77c860-32b0-5d92-9896-bef2c66a9894.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">took to the pages of the <em>Toronto Star</em></a> in 2012 to give his perspective: “As a young criminal defence lawyer, I was taught that I must approach every case with the assumption that all police officers lie all of the time. I was taught that to analyze their anticipated evidence from any other starting point would be gross negligence.” </p>
<p>Some of those fabrications, he wrote, weren’t just “borne out of the existence of contradictory evidence from another human being whose credibility was also in issue. I am referring to lies in the face of completely independent evidence: audio and videotapes, computer records, the laws of physics, and notes made by the officers themselves.” </p>
<p>Academics have found that lying is woven into the fabric of police culture. Arresting officers realize they can lie to secure confessions. Senior officers know they can exaggerate to lobby for bigger budgets. For some, a form of “noble cause corruption” is at play&mdash;a sense that any means will justify the ends of securing social order and making sure the bad guys go to jail.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n their efforts</span> to manipulate reality, police rely primarily on the media to convey their messages to the public. Sociologist Richard Ericson identified two types of reporters who typically cover the police beat: the inner circle and the outer circle. </p>
<p>Inner-circle reporters usually come from outlets that rely heavily on crime news to fill their pages and news lineups. These would include radio reporters who have little time for anything other than the briefest reports and rarely venture beyond spot news. But it would also include beat reporters for major newsrooms who depend on good relations with police to be kept in the know. Many police departments in big cities provide office space for journalists right inside the station. The inner-circle reporters often spend the bulk of their working day there and tell their assignment editors what the breaking news stories are. In effect, the police are able to define the news agenda for these reporters. “The repertoire of inner-circle reporters rarely included explanations or secondary understanding,” Ericson writes. </p>
<p>When not covering breaking crime news, inner-circle reporters produce features that typically show police in a positive light. They focus on the life of officers and how they do their jobs, along with the tools and techniques they use. Such reporters are frequently rewarded with scoops. They are the first to be notified about a drug bust or a significant investigation. They might be invited on a ride along when police intend to make an arrest. Police departments in many places arrange “perp walks,” which involve tipping off friendly reporters or photographers to a location where officers will parade a suspect in handcuffs down the street. This serves two purposes: to reward reporters with an exclusive, behind-the-scenes view of an arrest in action and to embarrass a suspect they don’t like for one reason or another.</p>
<p>Outer-circle reporters, on the other hand, detach themselves from police sources and have more of a mission to “police the police” rather than to co-operate with them, according to Ericson. This often leads to conflict between police and reporters. I spent much of my career operating in this outer circle, as a reporter and manager. While other reporters might get exclusives about police busts, I put greater value on having my newsroom look critically at the policies and actions of officers. It often led to tense moments, with police departments refusing to provide information on critical issues.</p>
<p>Police also attempt to entirely eliminate media reporting of certain crimes. Decades ago, in Winnipeg, if the police didn’t want media scrutiny of a particular case, they would ensure the accused appeared before a judge in a suburban courtroom where reporters rarely ventured.</p>
<p>An interesting example of a clumsy cover-up by both police and a Crown prosecutor occurred early in my career. One day, I was walking through the ornate halls of Winnipeg’s law courts building when a waving hand appeared from behind a door. A provincial court judge beckoned me into a room. “You will want to be in Courtroom 103 this afternoon at 2:00 p.m.,” he said. I didn’t need any further encouragement. I came to the courtroom and patiently waited as a series of accused appeared before a judge for sentencing.</p>
<p>Finally, a forty-eight-year-old man pleaded guilty to a hit-and-run incident. He was driving carelessly and hit another vehicle, injuring two people. Then he left the scene of the accident. The Crown attorney recited the facts of the case briefly, and both he and the man’s defence counsel jointly recommended a light sentence. </p>
<p>Provincial court judge John Enns paused for a moment and then admonished both lawyers for “studiously avoiding” mentioning that the accused was a Winnipeg police officer. “You should know better,” he scolded them. It was a telling example of how police use their influence to mislead and cover things up, with complicity from the Crown. In this case, though, a judge refused to play ball. </p>
<p>The following year, an internal city report not meant for public distribution showed how police routinely hid the occupation of police officers who had been charged with criminal offences.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">palpable shift</span> in the public’s attitude toward police took place after George Floyd’s murder. The incident sparked massive demonstrations in the United States and many other parts of the world. In Canada, a series of deaths following police “wellness checks” on people in racialized communities contributed to the mounting anger against law enforcement. “Defund the Police” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement and other activists, and the media began intensively scrutinizing police budgets and practices. <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-the-untold-story-of-how-police-spending-was-once-on-a-tear-and-isnt/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A <em>Globe and Mail</em> analysis</a> found that police budgets had escalated rapidly in recent years. Between 2009 and 2018, for instance, budgets grew by 66 percent in Alberta. In Ontario, the growth was 34 percent, compared to a 24 percent increase in social and family services and an 8 percent decline in spending on social housing. Some cities spent a significant portion of their total municipal budgets on policing. In Longueuil, Quebec, spending on police amounted to 29.8 percent of the entire city budget, while in Winnipeg, it was 26.8 percent.</p>
<p>The movement to defund police in the United States scored some initial successes. In budget votes throughout 2020, advocacy groups lobbied for and won cuts of $840 million in more than twenty police departments, with some of that money redirected to community services. Some cities, like Denver and Oakland, decided to eliminate police officers from schools.</p>
<p>Police departments everywhere faced an existential crisis. They were encountering criticism and increased pressure at every turn. One of their key strategies in response to this problem was to figure out how to get the media and the public back onside. Some insight into this strategy emerged in an online webinar organized at the end of 2020 by ShotSpotter, a US company that sells technology to police departments. The target audience for the webinar was police chiefs and public information officers (PIOs) for departments. The title of the webinar was: “Best Practices for Media Relations in a Time of Defund the Police,” and among the topics covered were “strategies to avoid landmines and change the narrative, and how to leverage social media and data to get the public on your side.”</p>
<p>Ron Teachman of ShotSpotter set the table for the conversation: “It’s likely that no police agency will be spared from having insufficient resources, unrealistic demands and expectations of service placed on them, and subsequent scrutiny of their performance, particularly from the media.” All this, he said, when “there is civil unrest in our streets and rapidly escalating violent crime.”</p>
<p>The two speakers, representing police departments in New Jersey and Virginia, echoed his concern. But they also offered potential solutions. Reach out to victims of crime, one suggested, and get them to speak publicly about the excellent job police are doing. “Share positive stories from your community validators, let them sell it. In today’s landscape every positive story needs to be amplified.” One speaker talked about a police force in New Jersey that was hit with massive layoffs in 2011 and had to rebuild itself. “The main driver for re-establishing credibility was the media,” he said.</p>
<p>In the end, it was good old-fashioned public relations and brand management that were presented as the key to surviving the crisis. For Toronto police, one recent solution was spending more than $300,000 to produce its own podcast to give people a “behind the scenes” look at policing. As one of the webinar experts noted, “If you’re not using your PIO as your brand ambassador, your corporate reputation risk manager, then you’re running in some pretty dangerous territory. The way you look, your interactions with the community, everything has to be thought about in a marketing and a trust-building fashion.” </p>

They’re here to celebrate my forty years in journalism. There’s the gang from <em>Domino</em> fashion magazine, where I got my start in the can’t-spend-enough, cocaine-stoked ’80s. The <em>Globe and Mail</em> crew, from the ambitious middle of my career, hang out with colleagues from <em>Maclean’s</em>, the <em>Toronto Star</em>, and <em>Metro</em>. (I moved around a lot.) The CBC News crowd are huddled to my left, protecting themselves and their fat budgets from the circling sharks of underfunded journalism. My final job was with them: we were together for the <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> shutdown, the murder of George Floyd, the storming of the Capitol in Washington, DC, the invasion of Ukraine, nuclear threats from Russia, and blazing forests and atmospheric rivers at home. It was the most punishing news cycle of my career. I wasn’t sad to be leaving.</p>
<p>Just beyond the guests and beyond the hornbeam trees where I’ve strung fairy lights for the party, I think I can see my future. The grind of work is finally over, my retirement dream cued up. April in Paris! Reading by the sea! Spanish lessons in Antigua so I can better speak to my grandson. I’ll be playing with him, too, in the open-ended days my children rarely knew with me. I’m not saying I deserve a life of ease. But I worked hard to earn my retirement, dropping giant chunks of my salary into company and government pension plans throughout those forty years. It’s time for the famous social contract to hold up its end of the bargain and take care of me, the way it did my father before me, to deliver on the idea that retirement is my right after a life of work and the promise that I will have the time and means to enjoy it. </p>

<p>Except none of that happened. The year since my retirement party has not been a dreamy passage to a welcoming future but a nerve-shattering trip into the unknown. My debt is swelling like a broken ankle; my hard-won savings may or may not be sucked into the vortex of an international market collapse. Can I keep my house? Who knows? The macroeconomy is messing with my microeconomy. The future keeps shape-shifting. And none of the careful planning I put into my retirement is going to change that. </p>
<p>When I left my last job, I felt sad for friends determined to keep working to seventy and beyond. How eccentric they seemed. Now I repeat the same two words whenever I see them: “Don’t retire.”</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="dropcap">R</span><span class="smallcaps">oughly a thousand people</span> are retiring each day in Canada, Fraser Stark, president of the Longevity Pension Fund at Purpose Investments in Toronto, told me. That’s about a million currently retired. Ours is the largest generation in Canadian history to move into retirement, and we tend to get distracted by the sheer number of us snailing through the system like a row of snowplows on a four-lane highway. But the bigger issue with retiring at sixty-four, which is the average age Canadians leave the workforce, can be summed up in one increasingly terrifying word: longevity. </p>
<p>Anyone retiring in Canada right now can expect to live at least until eighty (women until eighty-four). But those numbers are averaged out. When I began to discuss retirement with my financial planner in early 2022, he put my life expectancy at ninety-four. “Why, thank you,” I said, “I do try to keep fit.” “No,” said Benjamin Klein, senior portfolio manager at Baskin Wealth Management, “life expectancy is not randomized. When we factor in your gender, genetics, access to good health care, education, and lifestyle, that’s how long you’ll live.”</p>
<p>Stark doubled down on that number. The oldest Canadian is believed to have died at age 117. “If you want to accurately plan, that’s the number that you need to write down,” he said. Retire at sixty-four and you could have fifty more years to save for. </p>
<p>Every generation lives longer than the one that came before&mdash;nothing new there. But a fifty-year span between the end of work and the end of life is a long way from the original purpose of paid retirement, which was a very short bridge of financial support. Or no bridge at all. Otto von Bismarck has been trotted out and smacked down many times for his invention of paid retirement: in 1881, he proposed that all Germans had the right to government support after a life of work, with payments kicking in at age seventy. Except that life expectancy in the 1880s was about forty years. When Canada created its own pension plan, in 1965, to address the growing poverty of retired Canadians sixty-five and older&mdash;thank you, Lester B. Pearson, for my monthly CPP cheque&mdash;the life expectancy of men, who made up the bulk of the workforce, was sixty-eight.</p>
<p>By 2019, 37 percent of Canadians fifty-five and older were concerned they wouldn’t have enough savings when they retired, <a href="http://- Canada.ca https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/programs/research/canadian-financial-capability-survey-2019.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to</a> the Canadian Financial Capability Survey. And that was before the rush of retirements during COVID, a third of them earlier than planned. Lockdown’s low interest rates and curtailed spending gave false hope to retirees such as me&mdash;those unspending days when the money in my bank account seemed to self-spawn like guppies. And, also like guppies, its lifespan was short lived. </p>
<p>“There’s not enough gold in my golden years,” I told Klein a few months into my retirement. I could feel him smiling sympathetically across the phone line. “You’re not alone,” he assured me. Rents, mortgages, groceries&mdash;Canadians are suffering. I described the little house graphic on my gas bill: the house keeps getting smaller, thanks to my ferocious vigilance. But the bill keeps getting bigger, thanks to the cost of gas. And that’s just standard housekeeping. Throw in the unexpected, like a family wedding or grown kids moving back home, and many retired people land “somewhere on the spectrum of panic,” Klein said.</p>
<p class="pull-quote">The oldest Canadian is believed to have died at age 117. Retire at sixty-four and you could have fifty more years to save for.</p>
<p>According to BMO’s thirteenth <a href="https://newsroom.bmo.com/2023-02-07-BMO-Annual-Retirement-Study-Canadians-Believe-They-Need-1-7M-to-Retire-Up-20-Per-Cent-from-2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Annual Retirement Study</a> released this past February, Canadians believe they need $1.7 million to retire, up 20 percent from 2020, when they put it at $1.4 million. The number is not statistically supported, but it’s a good gauge of people’s emotional preparedness for retirement and how anxious they feel. That third of Canadians who were worried, in 2019, that they wouldn’t have enough money has jumped to more than half of us in 2023, and 74 percent are concerned about inflation and rising prices. </p>
<p>Fewer than a quarter of retiring Canadians have a defined benefit pension plan, Stark said. Instead, “many of us retire with a lump sum of money.” The amounts vary, but the massive uncertainty of how long the money will last doesn’t. “We don’t know how long we’re going to live; we don’t know what the interest rates will be; we don’t know what the stock markets will do; we don’t know what inflation rates are,” said Stark. “Every one of us when we retire is on a unique journey of insecurity.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t&#8217;s not only</span> the retired who need to worry about supporting themselves in the long stretch of their future. Working generations coming up behind them will also shoulder this burden. A metric called the dependency ratio calculates the proportion of the people not in the workforce who are “dependent” on those of working age. According to Statistics Canada, dependents are aged zero to nineteen and sixty-five and over. Productives are twenty to sixty-four. The international tool is often cited by government and business and has been a driver of pension-reform debates around the world.</p>
<p>A low dependency ratio&mdash;in Mexico, for example&mdash;means that there are enough people working to support the dependent population. A high ratio&mdash;Japan and South Korea are at the top&mdash;indicates more financial stress on workers. Across all OECD countries right now, there are about thirty people sixty-five and over for every 100 people of working age. In 1950, that ratio was fourteen to 100; by 2075, it is predicted to increase to fifty-five non-working adults for every 100 working. </p>
<p>In Canada, we’re at the lower end, with dependency expected to hit about thirty-five by 2025, according to <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/pensions-at-a-glance-2015/old-age-dependency-ratio_pension_glance-2015-23-en;jsessionid=u7Q5drCgbYElgirFEUbcU5kQQhgkBcz_MWWQ4vhE.ip-10-240-5-146" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2015 data</a> from the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. But by 2075, our dependency ratio is projected to be 49.9&mdash;one dependent for every two working-age Canadians. That’s a big burden for Xs, Ms, and Zs. “The shrinking percentage of young people means that in the future, the number of workers may be insufficient to finance the pensions of retirees,” according to StatCan. </p>
<p>The original meaning of the word “retire,” from the French “retirer,” is the act of retreating, falling back, withdrawing into seclusion. Except the retirees I spoke to for this story had go-go schedules that I was worn out just hearing about. Many had taken on dramatically different types of paid employment after leaving their careers; others had unleashed their inner rebels to become tireless advocates for social justice and climate change; still others were full-time caregivers. </p>
<p>“The government pays very little” for retired Canadians, said Thomas Klassen, professor at York University’s School of Public Policy and Administration. Of the experts I spoke to about retirement, he was the only one of traditional retirement age, so you could say he had a stake in the debate, but I found him reliably dispassionate. He pointed out that retirees in new jobs pay income tax, taxes on their retirement income and government subsidies, HST and GST, and they contribute to the economy by spending money. “And yet we keep hearing that boomers are hoarding all the money and that we will bankrupt younger people,” he said.</p>
<p>Samir Sinha called the dependency ratio outdated and misguided. The director of geriatrics at Sinai Health and University Health Network in Toronto and a passionate defender of the rights of older Canadians argued that such concepts hold us back. “They don’t recognize the new reality that at sixty-five you’re likely to have twenty years” of good and productive life ahead. </p>
<p>The retired are among the country’s biggest contributors to child care and volunteer work, Sinha said. “Think about the amount governments save for the unpaid care that mostly older people are providing. When we’ve priced out the unpaid caregiver, we’re valuing that in the billions and billions of dollars every year.”</p>
<p>Mieko Ise might be called a “silent retiree”: someone who quietly leaves the workforce to look after family members in need. For years, she juggled looking after her own and her husband’s parents while working full time for a Toronto nonprofit. “I started to have issues with being a caregiver and a full-time employee,” said Ise, now in her sixties. “I would take vacation days. I would book time off. My boss was not particularly sympathetic. I get it. I don’t believe employers should carry the load of your life burden.” When it became too overwhelming to have two jobs, Ise quit the one we count as work. </p>

" width="1200" height="1320" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-159890" /></p>
<p>Sinha pointed me to a Japanese movie called <em>Plan 75</em>, directed by Chie Hayakawa and released in 2022. In a dystopian future, Japan&mdash;which in real life is the demographically oldest OECD country, with a projected dependency ratio of seventy-seven to 100 by 2075&mdash;offers $1,000 to the elderly to terminate their own lives and relieve society of the burden of supporting them. The movie, which I watched with my seventy-six-year-old sister (a lawyer who retired at seventy-two), opened with a violent murder off camera. We heard the blast of gunshot and saw a wheelchair toppled on its side. “Cheery beginning,” said Laura. (It turned out&mdash;spoiler&mdash;the real <em>Plan 75</em> was to sell the older generations’ ashes for profit to a recycling company. The message of the sweetly weird movie was it’s better not to kill our elders.)</p>
<p>The year before <em>Plan 75</em> came out, Yusuke Narita, an assistant professor of economics at Yale University, suggested mass suicide and disembowelment for Japan’s aged. “I feel like the only solution is pretty clear,” he said in a 2021 video. Narita later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/12/world/asia/japan-elderly-mass-suicide.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">softened his comment</a>s in response to questions from the <em>New York Times</em>, saying they were an “abstract metaphor” (disembowelment seems pretty visceral to me). But he did win a big audience: he now has more than 600,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<p>It’s true that the number of people over sixty-five is growing faster in countries across Asia than anywhere else in the world at the same time that the size of their younger generations shrinks. That means as many as half of Japan’s employers report shortages of full-time workers, according to <em>New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/07/world/asia/japan-workers-retirement.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reporting</a> from earlier this year on ageing in Asia. Workers in their seventies and even eighties are stepping up to fill the gap, taking lower-paying jobs as delivery drivers, office cleaners, and store clerks&mdash;jobs that the younger generations don’t want. A quarter of people sixty-five and over in Japan are currently working. </p>
<p>The number is the same in Canada and increasing: 24 percent of Canadians aged sixty-five to seventy still work in jobs that can be measured, up from 11 percent in 2000. But the dependency ratio reinforces the belief that those sixty-five and over are not working. Workers are not counted as workers because they’ve <em>aged out</em> of the way that we count them. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">“T</span><span class="smallcaps">he Greys”</span> is what the older generation working for <em>Succession</em>’s Waystar RoyCo were called. They were often shot bunched together like an endangered species. They put on compression socks before flying. They plotted for their golden parachutes. Or maybe “one last rodeo,” as Karl, Waystar’s CFO, suggested to Frank, former vice chairman, in the final minutes of the hit series. Cut to Tom, the brand new CEO: “Frank, dead. Karl, dead. I really don’t need those two old cunts on my shoulder.” </p>
<p>I thought it was funny as hell. Or I did before my conversation with Lisa Taylor, president of Challenge Factory and co-author of <em>The Talent Revolution: Longevity and the Future of Work</em>. Taylor described ageism as “the last socially acceptable form of prejudice.” She and her company have set 2030&mdash;the year the last of the boomers reach sixty-five&mdash;as the target for solving what she described as the far-reaching and urgent issue of this country’s age-biased workforce.</p>
<p>I was skeptical. Surely, there are more important workplace issues to solve, like equity and fairness for people of every race and gender. But after a couple of hours on the phone with Taylor, I came to believe that treating retirement as a default outcome of ageing is a workplace bias that will affect the life expectancy, financial dependency, and long-term care costs for a generation retiring earlier than it needs or wants to. Not to mention the impact on the economy. Taylor said if we want to take advantage of our full workforce&mdash;in 2022, Canada had <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410032501" rel="noopener" target="_blank">nearly a million job vacancies</a>&mdash;we need to get to a point where we “recognize and call out ageism with the same level of comfort as we do other prejudices in our workplaces.”</p>
<p class="pull-quote">Fewer than a quarter of retiring Canadians have a defined benefit pension plan. Instead, many of us retire with a lump sum of money.</p>
<p>Systemic ageism was meant to have been legislated out of the workplace in 2006, when the Ontario Human Rights Commission won the argument that Canadian workers don’t come with a best-before date stamped on their foreheads. (I was a manager at the <em>Globe and Mail</em> at the time, I was fifty-one, and there was a lot of backroom worry about carrying the Greys on our backs&mdash;and a lot of wisecracks about a superannuated newsroom.) But even though sixty-five hasn’t been the legal age for retirement for seventeen years, “we’re constantly looking for ways to push them out the door,” said Sinha&mdash;with retirement packages, buyouts, and pension contributions capped at sixty-five. </p>
<p>Taylor’s company did a workplace survey of the financial services industry in 2015, and it showed that as early as age forty-nine, workers were no longer sent for training or high-performance programs and future-focused career conversations had slowed down. By the time someone hit fifty-five, “the conversation about leaving had been going on for years, except no one was actually saying it.” </p>
<p>My own conversations with retired Canadians, particularly men in finance, bore this out. Raymond Betts worked most of his life in the frenetic world of institutional equity in New York, Boston, and Toronto. (Betts asked that his name be changed for this article.) When he turned fifty-three, the company hired a younger employee to do the same job as his, without discussing it with him. “My desk was originally thirty-six inches long; they kept moving me to a smaller desk until I ended up sitting at one that was twenty-four inches long.” Betts left that world at sixty, taking his skills and work ethic to his second career as a real estate agent. </p>
<p>Many people buy into the company storyline that their best years are behind them&mdash;the proverbial coasting into retirement. “People start to say, ‘Susan’s checked out. Susan retired a few years ago, she just hasn’t told us,’” said Taylor. “It’s attributed to age instead of the company’s mismanagement of talent.”</p>
<p>It’s not a big step from there to the accepted myths about older workers: they’re slower and less productive. They’re over the hill, so training them is a cost instead of an investment. Ditto spending any time performance-managing them. The stickiest myth is that the long-time employee is too expensive. “Get this senior person off the books and hire two younger people to replace them,” is how Sinha put it. I’ve been part of those conversations myself about retirement-age people; likely my bosses also had them about me. But seeing the older worker as a financial burden is a failure of math. </p>
<p>“Calculations of how much employees cost a company generally include salary and benefits packages,” said Taylor. However, their not having to learn on the job, be trained, or engage the resources of a mentor, let alone the asset of being used as a mentor for younger staff&mdash;all of this also saves costs. “I have the experience, the relationships, the contacts. I work incredibly hard,” said Betts. He still does: he’s sold 132 houses in the seven years since he turned sixty.</p>
<p>I mentioned to Taylor that some of the Greys at CBC News seemed to struggle with technology during COVID. She stopped me. “We give a pass to the twenty-three-year-old with cats walking back and forth on camera,” she said. But we snicker when someone over sixty leaves their mike off. I blamed imminent senility, especially when the person on mute was myself. </p>
<p class="pull-quote">Another problem with retirement: it could kill you. People who stop working too soon may not have much time to live before they die.</p>
<p>Taylor was unsurprised. “Ageism is also self-imposed,” she said. Her example was the joke birthday cards we send each other. “If you replaced age with any other characteristic, you would never send it,” she said. I don’t mention the card I just received for my sixty-eighth birthday, a New Yorker cartoon called “Senior Charades.” The old man’s word bubble says: “Two words&mdash;I forgot what they are.” It got a big laugh and led to various tips about how to behave at work to appear less old: Don’t groan when you stand up. Smile in meetings so your face doesn’t sag into resting-old-face. And never rummage for anything, especially glasses. (Actually, never say the word “rummage.”) </p>
<p>Taylor, who turned forty-nine this spring (and says she’s been losing her glasses since she was twenty-two), is a long way from retirement; so are most of the experts I spoke with. I found their dedication moving; they saw it as realistic. “Unlike other prejudices, 100 percent of people will feel age prejudice if we don’t solve it,” said Taylor. Klassen thinks it will take twenty years for the workplace to reflect the law. Sinha said we’re still in the “baby steps” of realizing that longevity has implications for how long we work. “The workplace has not caught up with the reality of life expectancy, and therefore of career expectancy,” he said. </p>
<p>Working longer because you’re likely to live longer is not everyone’s idea of how best to reform retirement. It’s an anathema in France, to give the most widely reported example. President Emmanuel Macron finally pushed through his pension reforms this past spring, increasing the retirement age from sixty-two to sixty-four over a seven-year period. In the often-violent street battles that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/france-protests-police-violence-5a2e01ed4fbcfeee6a3ac098db94339c" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fed headlines</a> everywhere, protesters lost a thumb, an eye, and even, to one officer’s club in Paris, a testicle. One of the many slogans from the protests stood out for me: “Leave us time to live before we die.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smallcaps">ut here&#8217;s</span> a more existential problem with retirement: it could kill you. People who stop working too soon may <em>not</em> have much time to live before they die. “You hear about the doctors whose entire life and identity was at the hospital,” said Sinha. Then they retire and “they’re dead a few months later.” Similar sudden-death stories circulate about a certain type of driven, lifelong journalist, and I always assumed they were apocryphal. Or that the victim had been ignoring long-standing health issues. </p>
<p>Shortened life expectancy can be predicted by a lack of purpose, Sinha said. He referred to a “meta-analysis” project from 2010 that combined research from 148 studies involving 308,849 people to show that social connection and purpose increased survival by 50 percent. A lack of social relationships created the same risk of death as well-established factors such as smoking, drinking, and obesity. It was a gobsmacking discovery thirteen years ago; a lot of subsequent research has since supported the finding that early retirement can mean less time to enjoy it.<br />
The Blue Zones research into the world’s longest-lived people, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/5-blue-zones-where-the-worlds-healthiest-people-live" rel="noopener" target="_blank">much publicized</a> by National Geographic and now a Netflix docuseries called <em>Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zone</em>, also links longevity with purpose. “In the island community of Okinawa”&mdash;in Japan, where very long-lived women thrive on a diet of sweet potatoes, mugwort, and goya&mdash;“everybody can tell you what their sense of purpose is,” said Sinha. “They have a word for it: ikigai, which means ‘reason for being.’”</p>
<p>Every society uses markers as shorthand for people to understand each other. “In some societies, it’s your last name or who your parents were,” said Taylor. “Americans use job titles, but they’re equally likely to identify each other by the city they grew up in, or what university they went to, or what sports team they’re a fan of.” In Canada, she said, “we almost exclusively use our job titles to define who we are.” Sometimes we go so far as to use our previous job to describe ourselves after we retire, in what Taylor calls a “backwards-looking identity.” Even when we’re not working, “we reinforce work as a critical piece of our own identity.” </p>
<p>John Davey worked at Dow Chemical in his hometown of Sarnia, Ontario, for thirty-two years. He left at age fifty-eight. “I didn’t retire. I <em>was retired</em>,” Davey, who’s now seventy-two, told me. It was part of a company-wide downscaling (he bears no grudges). It took less than a month for him to understand he was not the stay-at-home type. “One day, I sat in my living room and hoped it would snow so I could go out and shovel.” He’s worked ever since, most recently as a flower-delivery-person. “I know men who say they are going to regrout the bathroom or whatever, but that’s done and then what?” he said.</p>
<p>Don O’Connor put the perils of not having purpose more starkly. He was in wealth management and real estate at TD Bank, in Toronto, for thirty-six years, so his financial literacy was better than the average Canadian’s. COVID made him realize how much he hated the three-hour commute, and so he retired last year, at sixty-two. Now he works part time at a funeral home in Burlington and loves everything about it&mdash;two-minute drive, flexible hours, every day is different&mdash;and puts up with the mild astonishment of his friends about his new job, because, as he told me on our call, “if you don’t do anything, you’re on an express route to death.” </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smallcaps">ere&#8217;s a bleak</span> prospect for many retiring Canadians: they will leave or be pushed out of the workforce too soon and without enough money. They’re financially prepared for the short and medium haul of life after work, but not the long one. They will go on to live too long, in too poor health (increased life expectancy has also increased the number of years people spend being sick), with a dwindling ability to support themselves or live independently. Ultimately, they’ll become wards of the state, housed in long-term care at great cost to the government and society. Sinha said: “This is where our destitute end up, in these government-run facilities.” According to a 2019 report by the National Institute on Ageing at Toronto Metropolitan University, long-term care costs <a href="https://www.niageing.ca/commentary-posts/10/7/long-term-care-costs-in-canada-projected-to-triple-in-only-30-years" rel="noopener" target="_blank">are expected to</a> triple from $22 billion to $71 billion by 2050. “It will be the equivalent of the modern-day Victorian poor house for our old,” Sinha said.</p>
<p>“We know this for a fact: the human brain is not equipped to make long-term decisions,” said Bonnie-Jeanne MacDonald, director of financial security research at the <a href="https://www.niageing.ca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Institute on Ageing</a>. “The human brain is very optimistic, which is great, but it can’t process the bad things that will happen in the future.” Decisions made now are not just for yourself in five years but for you in thirty years. “And that’s going to be a much more vulnerable person than you are right now, health wise.” </p>
<p>The National Institute on Ageing report says that, by 2050, care in one’s own home will cost up to $25,000 a month; care in a retirement home or residence could be as much as $10,000 a month. Those options will be unaffordable for most Canadians. Meanwhile, the number of people caring for family members at home will decrease sharply. Between now and 2050, Canada is expected to have 30 percent fewer voluntary caregivers, according to Sinha. Paid health care workers will not fill the gap: Canada’s universal health care system “was never designed to cover the provision of long-term care services,” including home and community care nursing, Sinha said. Long-term care insurance (LTCI) is now mandatory in Germany, South Korea, and Japan. Here in Canada, home-based care doesn’t even cover prescription medications. According to that 2019 Canadian Financial Capability Survey, a third of Canadians also worry they won’t be able to afford health care costs as they age, and rightly so. </p>
<p>“We spend the majority of our life savings paying for care in the last ten years of our life,” said Klein, the financial manager who put my life expectancy at ninety-four, which is sounding less and less like good news. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">f we could</span> create a different kind of retirement in Canada, a more inclusive, more creative, and flexible concept of work&mdash;and one that erased the grim picture of poor houses for the old&mdash;where would we start? After talking to dozens of experts and retired Canadians, three ideas, or ideals, formed my personal retirement manifesto. </p>
<p>The first would be to make measures against ageism part of every company’s fair-employment practice. Imagine a legacy career path that sees Canadians move from a forty- to a sixty-year work life, without censure or ridicule for being too old to work. I think of what Taylor said: “People change jobs all the time, but as we get older, we think we must continue doing exactly what we’re doing now or fall off a cliff. These are extreme alternatives.” The more high powered the job, and the higher in pay scale, the more we believe there is nowhere for workers to go but out. But many older workers prefer to forgo the intensity of management responsibilities, higher salaries, and relentless climbing and return to the craft work they excelled at in the beginning of their careers&mdash;even for a lot less money. Go ahead and ask them. As my own career wound down, I often thought&mdash;but did not say&mdash;that I wanted to go back to writing and editing, to revive my love of words that had taken me all the way to senior news director at the CBC, where I wasn’t allowed anywhere near copy.  </p>
<p>The second tenet of my manifesto is phased retirement. This one took me a while to get to, even though every expert and most of the retirees I spoke to were for it. I asked fellow CBC leader Greg Reaume, sixty-eight, who retired from running world news at CBC News a few months before I left myself, what he’d have said if I’d asked him to stay on a couple of days a week for the next two years, or if we’d opened that option to everybody. “A minefield,” Reaume said. “And complicated to manage.” “Right?” I agreed. Which is exactly the problem. Even if bosses like us believe in and desire phased retirement, taking on the labour-intensive job of juggling the options (do you make it mandatory to offer, but voluntary to accept?) and coordinating the schedules of part-time staff would keep managers from getting on side. We need to get them on side, though, because think of the benefits: to the worker who wants to keep contributing, to the employer who keeps getting returns on their experience and work ethic, and to the Canadian economy in need of workers. Figure that out and we move toward retirement becoming an adaptive and gradual transition rather than an on/off switch. Indeed, Klassen’s research showed a strong preference among older workers to gradually ease out of full-time employment, working fewer days over a period of several years. His definition of retirement is “a transition from working mostly full time to not working mostly full time.” </p>
<p>Finally, I propose we find new words to describe both retirement and retirees. A line from a 2014 <em>Atlantic</em> story on American retirement <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/09/the-great-stock-myth/308178/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">puts the lie</a> to the core idea of traditional retirement. “I don’t know if it’s ever going to be realistic that everyone saves enough to spend the last third of their life on vacation,” New York economist and author Allison Schrager was quoted as saying. (When I called her recently to ask if she still stood by this idea, her answer was a firm <em>yes</em>.) That vision of retirement, the one my father enjoyed and the one I had teed up for myself? None of it makes any sense anymore. Media, banks, and self-help books have lately been bandying around the term “The New Retirement,” but we should really be talking about the end of retirement. Instead of talking about “The Retired,” we should be talking about “The <em>Un</em>retired.” Not the undead&mdash;not yet&mdash;but maybe as indomitable. </p>
<p>Except that’s not right either. If our goal is to have Canadians work for as long as they’re excited and willing and able and empowered to do so, how about if we just call them workers? Because the essential zeitgeist of the retiree in 2023 is to keep working, however that looks. </p>
<p>Raymond Betts, even as he moves from being “goal oriented to soul oriented,” told me he will “never retire. My father worked until he was ninety-seven and died four months later, at ninety-eight.” Betts wasn’t sure he’d see the point in going on without work. “Work gives me a reason to call someone,” he said. “I have a mission. I have a reason to talk to people.”</p>
<p>Mieko Ise believes retirement is a time to take risks in a way that younger people who need to keep their jobs can’t. “Speak out!” she said. “I want to be reinvigorated, not retired.” Vicki Obedkoff, who retired in Saskatoon at seventy-one, after forty years as a minister with the United Church of Canada, fights for the same causes she’s always supported: climate change, human rights, and social justice. She quoted Alice Walker: activism is my rent for living on the planet. “I think about her often,” said Obedkoff. “I can’t see a time in the future when I will let this work go.”</p>
<p>Marjorie Beaucage, a seventy-six-year-old artist and Elder who lives in Duck Lake, Saskatchewan, was baffled by the whole idea of retirement. “I don’t know any of those retired people,” she said. “Elders don’t retire. Neither do artists. For Elders, this time of life is the busiest. You have to be there for your community.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he way I think</span> about my own retirement has changed significantly since I started working on this article. I’m part of a generation that will live the longest in history and also work the longest, if the big thinkers&mdash;and the workers themselves&mdash;succeed in moving Canadians from a forty-year career path to a sixty-year one. It’s new terrain, and the best way through is to be alert, adaptable, open to failure, and ready to act fast on success. </p>
<p>I don’t see retiring when I did as a failure&mdash;I had my second career as a writer I wanted to focus on and that grandson I’m gaga to spend time with. But I wonder why I didn’t have the conversation about a staged departure into a different kind of role, or why no one else had it with me. </p>
<p>I’m newly alert to dinner-table banter that turns ageist. It is without exception driven by people my age. “It’s time for the old farts to make way for the next generation,” said one retired financial industry executive at a recent dinner party when the conversation turned to the <em>Globe and Mail</em>’s leadership. (Phillip Crawley, publisher, announced <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-globe-and-mail-ceo-phillip-crawley-to-retire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his retirement</a> a month later, at seventy-eight.) “Hold on,” I said and then held forth on what I’ve learned about age prejudice. It may have been obnoxious. I will probably keep doing it. (Speak out, inner rebel!) </p>
<p>For now, I’m following Benjamin Klein’s simple financial advice: more input, less output. “Those are the only two things we can control,” he said. Which could mean getting a job&mdash;and not in management or journalism but something completely different. I’ve been an admirer of people who dedicate their retirement to volunteer work but felt pity when I saw someone my own age shelving groceries or working as a greeter. Now I think, “Long life headed your way, my friend!” I’ve stopped “backwards identifying” myself by the work I used to do, after Lisa Taylor asked me to “please be bold and to introduce yourself as you are now.” In my case, that’s as a writer. Now and then I even try to picture my future self, thirty years from now, but Bonnie-Jeanne MacDonald is right. It’s unfathomable. I accept that older Cathrin will be more fragile. Hopefully not in the poor house but perhaps a modest room or two, with a few things to remind me of the people I love&mdash;and also with the people I love. Likely I won’t be working. We can but hope. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-end-of-retirement/">The End of Retirement</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>This story contains details about sexual assault that some readers may find disturbing.</em></p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t was late</span> January 2015, after midnight, when one of the few female officers at the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary received a call on her police radio. “Unknown trouble,” said the dispatcher. A woman was upset. She had been drinking, was confused by her whereabouts, and feared for her safety.</p>
<p>“I’ll go,” constable Kelsey Muise radioed back.</p>
<p>Muise (then using her maiden name Aboud) pulled over when she saw a young woman with dark hair and glasses standing on the side of Newfoundland Drive in St. John’s. The woman, known today only as Jane Doe, asked to be taken to a friend’s house. In the back seat of the patrol car, she said, “I need to tell you something.” Jane Doe gulped back air and began crying hysterically. Muise pulled into a convenience store parking lot and flicked on the dome light. She turned to her passenger to better take in what she was saying. </p>

<p>As Jane Doe would later explain in court, she’d left a bar shortly after 3 a.m. four days before Christmas. She descended an alleyway of stairs and stepped into a downtown street. She was drunk and wanted to go home. Scanning for a taxi, she noticed a patrol car close by. She discussed a ride home with the policeman, and he unlocked the back door. A cop was safer than a cabbie, she figured, and got in.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, they pulled up outside her basement apartment. Jane Doe couldn’t find her keys. The officer discovered an unlocked kitchen window and slid it open for her to climb through. He came to the back door to make sure she was okay, and Jane Doe let him in. The two stood talking in her living room. They kissed, and then, feeling too drunk to stand, Jane Doe sat on her brown loveseat. She passed out and came to at the sound of the police officer’s voice. She was naked, and he was standing over her, penetrating her anally. He said he’d missed two call-outs and had to go. Jane Doe recalled seeing him in her bathroom, adjusting his uniform. The whole encounter, a jury would later learn, from the time the police officer parked outside the apartment to when he left, lasted about nineteen minutes.</p>

</ul>
<p>The next morning, Jane Doe awoke in bed, confused. Her flowered crop top and purple high-waisted pants were strewn on the living room floor. There were muddy footprints on the white kitchen countertop. It hurt to go to the washroom. And there were friction burns on the inside of her thighs. She also noticed bruises on her legs.</p>
<p>In the back of Muise’s cruiser, Jane Doe’s story came tumbling out. She didn’t even know the name of the police officer who had driven her home. All she knew was he had short hair, was taller than her, and looked like he was in his thirties. Over the course of the month since the assault, Jane Doe had wavered between blaming herself and wondering if she could have stopped or changed what happened. She felt too scared to go to the police. “Who’s going to believe me?” she confided to a friend at the time.</p>
<p>After more than an hour, Muise drove Jane Doe home and hugged her goodbye. Someone would be in touch, she said. Then Muise took a deep breath. She had witnessed inappropriate and illegal sexual behaviour at the RNC before. It had always been brushed aside. But she vowed it would be different this time. She wasn’t about to let this one go.

<div class="main_housing" style="max-width: 728px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" style="margin: 0.8075em 0; padding-bottom:2.5em;">Kelsey Muise outside her Newfoundland home</figcaption><p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he Royal</span> Newfoundland Constabulary, one of the oldest police forces in North America, was officially founded in 1871. For more than a century prior to that, British soldiers had helped police St. John’s, but when Britain decided to withdraw its garrison from the port city in 1870, Newfoundland was left to set up its own force to maintain law and order. The next year, a notice appeared in the Royal Gazette. “Wanted, a few strong active young men between 19 and 27 years of age,” read the ad. “They must be well recommended for honesty, sobriety, and fidelity.” The Newfoundland Constabulary moved into Fort Townshend, the former headquarters of the British garrison, where it remains today in a modern brick and glass building. About 400 officers serve the major towns and cities in the province.</p>
<p>The RNC swore in its first female members in 1980&mdash;six years later than the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which also patrols rural areas in the province. Women had already been part of the constabulary for more than two decades by the time Muise arrived, at age twenty, shortly after graduating from the Atlantic Police Academy in Prince Edward Island. She was blonde with green eyes and a shy smile. She’d grown up around the police officers who visited her father’s tow truck business at their home in Sydney, Nova Scotia. Those officers were kind and friendly, and as she got older, Muise realized she wanted to help people like they did. As a kid, she tried to rescue every stray cat and dog she encountered. Once, at a movie theatre with her mother, she got up and sat with an elderly man who was sitting alone.</p>
<p>Arriving in a new city where she had her own apartment and car felt freeing and exciting. But it wasn’t long before she started to see, as a patrol officer, the harshness of the real world, one where men threw women through walls and beat their faces bloody.</p>
<p>She often took flak, for being so young and also a woman, from people she was arresting.</p>
<p>“What are you gonna do?”</p>
<p>“Are you even old enough to be here?”</p>
<p>And so she’d hit the gym, to lift weights, so that even if those around her didn’t think she could handle herself, she knew she could. She was stationed in the west district where, at the time, there were a handful of female officers. The first time she remembers a colleague saying something unsettling to her was in the parking lot of the police station. “How many fucking batteries does your baton take?” a much older constable asked. Muise, taken aback, laughed stiffly. She felt she had to try to fit in.</p>
<p>It became obvious that some of her fellow male officers didn’t see her as one of them. She recalled walking into a meeting room and glancing around for a seat. One officer tipped his head back and waggled his tongue in the air. “You can sit right here,” he said as the room full of men chortled in unison. She’d grown up with an older brother and was familiar with juvenile male behaviour, but this was far worse than she had expected.</p>
<p>That same year, an officer brandished a furry highway patrol hat in front of his crotch. “Does your curtain match your drapes?” he asked as the room erupted in laughter. Embarrassed, Muise walked away. These were the people who were supposed to be protecting women?</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">fter meeting</span> Jane Doe, Muise took a moment to collect herself. She knew how rare it was for survivors to come forward in the first place. She had heard about male colleagues declaring reports of sexual violence “unfounded,” or baseless. That meant no arrest, no trial, no conviction and no punishment. So, instead of filing a report in the computer system as she normally would, Muise turned in a handwritten report to the active sergeant that night&mdash;someone she trusted. The complaint moved swiftly up her chain of command and ended up with the RNC unit that deals with sexual assault cases.</p>
<p>Later that morning, sergeant Tim Hogan was at home when his work cellphone rang. A seasoned cop in charge of the child abuse and sexual assault unit, he was ordered to take over the investigation. Hogan arranged for Jane to be interviewed that weekend and listened as she tearfully recounted the assault. He felt certain there was enough to continue the investigation, but he had to move quickly. Careful to loop in only senior staff to stop news of the investigation from spreading, Hogan brought on the supervisor of the police communications centre. At the time, the centre used GPS to monitor the location of police vehicles. The supervisor searched those records, looking for the cars signed out on the night of the assault. They showed car number 221 had been parked outside Jane Doe’s address. Communication logs revealed that dispatch had called for the officer twice around 3 a.m.</p>
<p>Next, Hogan and a forensic identification sergeant visited Jane Doe’s apartment. She showed them where the assault had occurred, then she waited outside with her family. The sergeant shone a UV light on the middle of her brown loveseat and saw an effervescent blue glow, signalling the presence of human bodily fluid. He unzipped the cushion cover and sent it to a lab.</p>
<p>Hogan knew it would be difficult to keep the investigation quiet within the constabulary. There was no way they could use their own surveillance teams. His supervisor reached out to the RCMP, and Hogan asked them to help surveil the suspected officer and obtain a DNA sample.</p>
<p>On a drizzly day in February, the Mounties staked out an off-duty cop at a local Starbucks in St. John’s. When he got up to leave, they snagged the white ceramic mug he had been drinking from and slipped it into an evidence bag. The DNA from the loveseat was a near-perfect match of the DNA from the mug. It belonged to Carl Douglas Snelgrove, a thirty-seven-year-old married street patrol cop. He had been on the force for a decade.</p>
<p>That summer, an officer arrested Snelgrove and read him his rights, the same words Snelgrove had said to others over the years. This time, he was one of the bad guys.

<div class="main_housing" style="max-width: 728px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps"> year</span> and a half later, in 2017, Jane Doe trudged up the stone steps of the fortress-like Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador. She wore her first ever suit&mdash;a black polyester jacket and slacks carefully purchased at the mall after she googled “what to wear in court.”</p>
<p>In the courtroom, Jane sat on a wooden bench alongside her parents, sister-in-law, an aunt, and some cousins. Her two brothers, who had always looked out for her, were absent; they couldn’t face being in the same room with the cop who had violated their baby sister.</p>
<p>The odds were against her. Winning a sexual assault conviction against a cop is hard. A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08974454.2022.2126744" rel="noopener" target="_blank">September 2022 study</a> by Kate Puddister and Danielle McNabb, published in <em>Women &#038; Criminal Justice</em>, looked at this problem in Ontario, <a href="https://theconversation.com/convictions-remain-rare-when-police-are-accused-of-sexual-assault-194965">analyzing</a> the outcomes of 689 reports of police-involved sexual assault made to the Special Investigations Unit, a police oversight agency, between 2005 and 2020. According to the findings, only 7.4 percent of those reports resulted in criminal charges, and only 1.59 percent ended in a conviction and sentence. It’s not difficult to see why the rate is so low. Cases often hang on the credibility of the complainant versus that of the accused. And here police have advantages. They enjoy built-in authority in the justice system&mdash;a system they know their way around.</p>
<p>This was the institutional machinery and lopsided dynamic that Jane Doe faced as she took the stand, reliving the night of the assault and describing it in detail. The job of undermining Jane Doe’s story went to Randy Piercey, Snelgrove’s defence lawyer at the time. Piercey maintained that all sexual activity was consensual. Throughout the trial, he tried to chip away at the claim that Jane Doe had felt coerced. He focused on her choices after leaving the bar the night of the assault. </p>
<p>“Why did you go alone?”</p>
<p>“Why not go to your friends?”</p>
<p>“You felt confident enough to go get a cab at that hour of the morning by yourself?”</p>
<p>At one point, Piercey showed the jury a photo of the basement window Jane Doe had climbed through, to argue that she wasn’t as intoxicated as she said she was.</p>
<p>“Did you have any difficulty getting through that window?”</p>
<p>“No,” she said.</p>
<p>“Even at your size, I imagine it was difficult to get in through that window?”</p>
<p>“No,” she said. “Not for me.”</p>
<p>The lawyer asked her to describe the counter height and whether she had any trouble getting down: “Would you agree that, even sober, that would not be an easy thing to do&mdash;climb into the window onto the countertop and down onto the floor?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” she said.  </p>
<p>“OK, but you can imagine, sober&mdash;is that something you would want to be doing every day?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Jane Doe.</p>
<p>“So, I would suggest to you that you would appear to be sober when you did that,” said Piercey.</p>
<p>“OK,” she whispered.</p>
<p>“Would you agree or disagree?”</p>
<p>“Well, I wasn’t,” she said.</p>
<p>“But if someone was looking at you, and saw what you were doing, would that not give them a message about your degree of intoxication?”</p>
<p>“I guess,” she said.</p>
<p>Piercey seized on the fact that Jane Doe had told police she couldn’t remember whether she consented or not. He argued that not only created reasonable doubt about her level of drunkenness but left open the possibility she was aware enough to make decisions&mdash;including agreeing to sexual activity. Later, when Snelgrove took the stand, he delivered his script: she didn’t seem drunk, she invited him in, she took her clothes off, she wanted it. To Jane Doe, he sounded confident, cocky even. Dudley Do-Right tricked into unzipping his pants.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he case against</span> Snelgrove rested on the definition of consent. Sexual activity in Canada is legal only when both parties agree to it, and, as the courts have interpreted it, consent must be communicated voluntarily and affirmatively, either through words or conduct. It can’t be inferred from silence or passivity. </p>
<p>Crucially, the criminal code has a provision for situations where the accused has abused their position of trust, power, or authority to commit a sexual crime. Crown prosecutor Lloyd Strickland argued that the presiding judge, justice Valerie Marshall, needed to instruct the jury on that provision. The Crown was confident that the jury would come to see that Jane Doe could not have consented because she was either unconscious or too drunk. But even if she had said yes, the Crown maintained, this still didn’t meet the legal threshold for consent: Snelgrove could have induced her into sexual activity by exploiting her feelings of trust in him.</p>
<p class="pull-quote">Consent must be communicated either through words or conduct. It can’t be inferred from silence or passivity.</p>
<p>Justice Marshall wouldn’t accept that. Because Jane Doe could not recall what had happened, the judge pointed out, there wasn’t enough evidence that Snelgrove had attempted to leverage his position to gain consent. It was thus unfair, she argued, to instruct the jury on this aspect of the law. And so, uninstructed, the jury never considered it.</p>
<p>It took two days for jurors to declare Snelgrove not guilty. Immediately after the foreperson uttered the words, Jane Doe was whisked, sobbing, out the back of the courtroom by supporters.</p>
<p>Outside, a protest erupted. A crowd lingered on the steps of the courthouse until nightfall, chanting, “No excuse for violent men.” The next day, the courthouse door had been pelted with eggs. The downtown was defaced with graffiti: “Believe victims,” someone had sprayed in white letters. “St. Johns cops believe in rape” and “Fuck u RNC.”</p>
<p>Jane Doe, encouraged by the protest, decided to keep fighting. The Crown appealed on her behalf and won. Her lawyers argued that the jury should have been allowed to consider the power differential. In the fall of 2018, two of three appeal court judges agreed, a decision later upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2019. “It would have been open to the jury to conclude,” wrote Supreme Court justice Michael Moldaver, that “the accused took advantage of the complainant who was highly intoxicated and vulnerable, by using the personal feelings and confidence engendered by their relationship to secure her apparent consent to sexual activity.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada decision paved the way for a new trial. By then, it had been five Christmases since Jane Doe had stepped into Snelgrove’s patrol car. After months of being jolted awake at night, sweaty and scared, she had started on new antidepressants and completed two programs at community college. Still, she felt stagnant, like she couldn’t heal. St. John’s no longer felt safe. She worried she’d run into him. So she moved to a remote cove hours away.</p>
<p>The retrial was set for March 2020 but took place in September due to pandemic delays. Proceedings were held in a former school in St. John’s to allow for physical distancing. The case captured the attention of the island again, but things unexpectedly unravelled. About eight days in, before the verdict was delivered, the presiding judge declared a mistrial after improperly dismissing two jurors.</p>
<p>Jane Doe, increasingly exasperated, agreed to try again. A third trial, under a different judge, took place in the same building in May 2021. The city blossomed with support. There were signs, some hand drawn, in the windows of homes, cars, and businesses all over St. John’s. “Three trials is too many,” said one. “We believe survivors,” said another. A woman painted rocks with messages of support and tucked them beside the hyacinth and heathers of her garden. Students hung banners in solidarity. Many updated their social media profiles with a post that said #SupportForJaneDoe.

If you start to feel angry, ask for a break, she recalled being told by the Crown and victim services. On the stand, Snelgrove’s lawyer pressed her about her decision to seek advice from a litigation lawyer in the early days of the police investigation. Piercey seemed to suggest what Jane Doe was really after was a cash settlement. “You wanted to find out if this jury is going to find him guilty, then you will pursue him civilly,” Piercey said to her during cross-examination.</p>
<p>“No,” Jane Doe cried. “I just want this over.”</p>
<p>Piercey swung again. He accused Jane Doe of waiting for the outcome of the trial before going forward with a suit. He kept needling, trying to get her to say she was going to sue. “If they convict, you’ll consider it?” he asked.</p>
<p>“It’s a consideration,” yelled Jane Doe. “I just don’t know.”</p>
<p>The jury deliberated for two days. Jane Doe and her family members gathered in one of the school’s empty classrooms, waiting to hear the verdict on a television broadcasting from the room. At the word “guilty,” her jaw dropped. She sat in disbelief. Her mother, who had taken time off from her job as a grocery store cashier to be with her daughter, felt a rush of pride. Everyone had underestimated her daughter, she thought&mdash;“that tiny scrap of a thing.”</p>
<p>In the parking lot, Muise, the police officer who had picked Jane up that cold January night more than six years earlier, sat in her Jeep. Tears streamed down her face when she saw the verdict on Twitter (now X). She had hoped to catch Jane Doe’s eye when she left the building, but instead, she spotted Snelgrove being escorted in handcuffs.</p>
<p>Outside, supporters cheered and hugged. Cars and trucks blew past, honking in support. Across St. John’s, a dozen billboards flashed the words “Support for Jane Doe.” In the small fishing town where Jane grew up, members of a women’s dart tournament held a moment of silence.</p>
<p>In November 2021, Snelgrove was sentenced to four years in prison. He shook his head as the judge declared him a federal sex offender and stood as a sheriff clinked handcuffs on his wrists behind his back. He faced a row of mostly female supporters, who included his wife. She wore a pink sweater, her hair in a bun, and put her fingers to her mask, as if to blow him a kiss.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="smallcaps">ynn Moore</span>, a litigation lawyer who had given Jane Doe advice in the early days of the police investigation, wrestled with what to do. After Snelgrove’s conviction, a credible source provided details suggesting that the culture of sexual misconduct within the RNC ran deeper than anyone suspected. On July 19, 2021, Moore turned to Twitter and asked for information about other assaults by on-duty police officers. Her phone blew up. She fielded dozens of calls from women with stories disturbingly similar to Jane Doe’s. Moore, who is married to a retired police officer, was apoplectic. “When you’re on duty as a police officer, you’re supposed to be upholding the law, not violating it, not violating people,” she told me. “It’s just such an abuse of power.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada decision about Jane Doe’s case&mdash;namely, that Snelgrove at the wheel of a marked police car and wearing a uniform was enough of a potential inducement&mdash;led to a clearer, more nuanced understanding of consent law, providing better protection for victims of sex crimes. Almost a year after her tweet, Moore represented eight women who filed two separate civil suits in Newfoundland and Labrador’s Supreme Court. They allege that the province, the employer of the RNC, knew or ought to have known that police officers were preying on women and took no steps to stop them. </p>
<p>One of Moore’s clients is an RNC officer. Her lawsuit alleges she was out drinking downtown in June 2014 when an on-duty sergeant gave her a ride home in his police car. He invited himself in for a beer and raped her. The second lawsuit details allegations, from seven other women, of sexual assaults by police officers, spanning more than a decade and a half. They say they were picked up in police cars and forced into unwanted sexual acts. One incident from around 2014 was similar to the Snelgrove case. A drunk woman left a downtown bar and was driven home by an RNC officer. According to court documents, he helped her get into her home as she had lost her keys. Once inside, he raped her. (When asked for comment on the pending lawsuits, an RNC spokesperson said that the department “does not comment on matters before the court or those anticipated to be before the court.”)</p>
<p>The RNC quietly changed its rules about transporting the public in patrol vehicles, according to a Canadian Press story from September 2021. Officers are now allowed to drive civilians only as part of a call for service. The next summer, a civilian-led police oversight agency found a “disturbing pattern” of police officers using their position “to solicit sexual favour from women in the St. John’s area.” The agency determined that several incidents deserved a more thorough investigation, including one reported in 2017 in which a police officer drove a woman home from downtown, put his tongue in her mouth, and tried to put his hand up her skirt. The RNC allowed the officer to resign with no further action. </p>
<p>The impact of Jane Doe’s case on the RNC went further. An independent workplace review, published in 2022, found a significant number of police officers&mdash;as many as 45 percent&mdash;did not believe their workplace was free of offensive, degrading, and humiliating behaviour. One of the review’s recommendations was to create an office for police personnel to bring allegations of misconduct.  </p>
<p>For Jane Doe, the realization that her case encouraged other sexual assault victims to come forward was staggering. “If I hadn’t spoken up, none of these people likely would’ve either,” she told me at her kitchen table in rural Newfoundland. “I still can’t believe it.”</p>
<p>What she really wants is to start her life again. To go on vacation without worrying about being called back to court. To start a family with her partner. To move into a new house. And to tell her scared younger self that she’s going to be okay, that it’s finally all over. (As of this writing, Snelgrove has petitioned the Supreme Court of Canada to overturn his guilty verdict.)</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="smallcaps">ive months</span> after picking up Jane Doe and reporting her case, Muise was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. During the years the case wound through court, she struggled. She felt targeted as officers showed up in court to support Snelgrove. She felt they looked down on her for “selling out” one of their own. Eventually, it became too much, and she took stress leave. She recalled one occasion when Snelgrove approached her outside the courtroom. He wasn’t mad at her, he said, and leaned forward to give her a hug. Disgusted, Muise walked away.</p>
<p>Muise thought of Jane Doe often but held back from contacting her throughout the trials. Ahead of the sentencing, Jane Doe texted Muise a copy of her victim impact statement. In the four-page document, Jane Doe described how she took medication for anxiety and depression. How she felt suicidal. How she had become scared of people in positions of power. How she felt like she had lost control of her life and her body. How she still woke up from nightmares and experienced flashbacks of Snelgrove standing over her. And how she credited Muise with saving her life. “Thanks to grace, higher powers and reasons unknown to me,” Jane Doe wrote, “Constable [Muise] was driving that night. She changed my life by believing in me.”</p>
<p>Looking back, after years of therapy, Muise sees that Jane’s case is part of her own story. “It changed so much in my life,” said Muise, who spoke to me last October on an overcast afternoon in St. John’s. Recently retired after nineteen years in service, she finally felt free to speak.</p>
<p>In a baseball cap and facing the front door of the cafe so she could see who walked in, Muise, then thirty-nine, described how, when she was twenty-one&mdash;the same age Jane Doe was at the time of her assault&mdash;she was out drinking downtown and was offered a ride home by a cop in his patrol car. She was drunk when the officer made unwanted sexual advances and inappropriately touched her while parked outside her home. She described another time when she was twenty-nine. Again, she was out drinking with friends downtown, and a sergeant offered her a ride home. When they got to her place, he invited himself in to use the bathroom and groped her.</p>
<p>Muise said she didn’t report the assaults because, at the time, it seemed normal&mdash;just another instance of crude behaviour she was expected to tolerate on the job as a female police officer. Plus, she said, echoing Jane, “Who’s going to believe a drunk person over a sober police officer?” </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/how-a-sexual-assault-case-in-st-johns-exposed-a-police-forces-predatory-culture/">How a Sexual Assault Case in St. John’s Exposed a Police Force’s Predatory Culture</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

The challenge had been brought by a group called Students for Fair Admissions. Its founder, conservative legal activist Edward Blum, “do[es] not believe” in systemic racism, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/08/us/edward-blum-affirmative-action-race.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an interview in the <em>New York Times</em></a>, and has spent years trying to weed out the concept of racial equity from American law. Less than two months after his legal victory against higher education, Blum turned to his next mark: diversity fellowships. In two querulous, virtually duplicate lawsuits, the plaintiff, American Alliance for Equal Rights&mdash;another Blum-led outfit&mdash;accused the law firms Morrison Foerster and Perkins Coie of perpetuating “rank discrimination” by earmarking certain fellowships for minoritized candidates. </p>
<p>The two defendants took the challenge very differently. In a statement to CNN, Perkins Coie pledged to “defend this lawsuit vigorously.” Morrison Foerster, which calls itself “MoFo” and won a 2023 “Outstanding Firm for Diversity &#038; Inclusion” award from a legal research company, folded immediately and removed any specific references to race or queerness from the language of the job posting. However, their website’s robust workplace-culture page that trumpets the many faces of “MoFo Diversity”&mdash;including the banner announcing their big award&mdash;remains unchanged.</p>

</ul>
<p>It’s common for legal professionals to extol diversity as a business asset&mdash;even if they cave as soon as someone holds their feet to the fire. Virtually every firm in Canada and the US has a Diversity and Equity tab on its website professing similar values. But attempts to move beyond mere lip service have historically been fraught. While big-law fellowships might look like an oddly specific thing to challenge, the move to weed out equitable hiring feeds into a much longer history of exclusion, one that has long shaped the legal profession in North America. As much as the field keeps saying it wants to change, its reaction in the face of controversy often suggests something different.</p>
<p>The demographics are already abysmal. According to the <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/diversity-inclusion-center/2021-md-survey-2nd-edition.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">American Bar Association’s 2020 survey</a>, 86 percent of all lawyers in the US were white. The Canadian Bar Association doesn’t keep comparable national figures. But 2019 statistics provided by various provincial law societies show that white lawyers made up an estimated 74.9 percent of those who practised in Ontario; in British Columbia, 16.15 percent of lawyers identified as a visible minority; and in Nova Scotia, 22 percent identified as members of an equity-seeking group. The high proportion of whiteness isn’t the result only of passivity or the failure to recruit more diverse candidates. It’s the remainder of deliberate historical attempts to bar women and people of colour from the profession.</p>
<p>In the US, Black lawyers were admitted to the American Bar Association only in 1943. Before you “meanwhile, in Canada” me, the Canadian legal field has perpetuated similar exclusions for centuries, just under sneakier guises. In a paper on the concept of legal professionalism, Constance Backhouse argues that power and exclusion are some of lawyering’s founding tenets. The idea of professionalism, she writes, “has been inextricably linked&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;to masculinity, whiteness, class privilege, and Protestantism.” In 1825, in order to be admitted to the Law Society of Upper Canada, candidates had to demonstrate a robust knowledge of classics, a barrier to entry that “carried unmistakable connotations of class, gender and race.” Who gets deemed worthy of making arguments in court, Backhouse says, has a bearing on the content of those arguments, the ensuing way the law develops, and which communities get access to justice.</p>
<p>These histories, and their legacy in the current makeup of the profession, coexist awkwardly with the way employers tend to talk about their DEI initiatives. In “<a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/hadiya-roderique-black-on-bay-street/article36823806/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Black on Bay Street</a>,” a 2017 essay for the <em>Globe and Mail</em>, Hadiya Roderique dissects the elusive concept of “fit”&mdash;as in, a candidate’s ability to conform to a given workplace culture&mdash;and how, in hiring situations, “we end up defining fit, and thus merit, in our own image.” This makes joining the field an uphill battle for a non-white applicant, even though it’s hip for managers to talk a big game about their inclusive hiring practices. This was Roderique’s experience during her job hunt and even after she’d made it into a top-tier firm: employers “give the appearance of being hungry for qualified and diverse candidates,” she writes, “but their attempts fumble because&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;they hire people who fit into the firm as it already exists.” Even if someone does make it through the door&mdash;via the proactive gesture of an equity fellowship or not&mdash;making one token hire is a fundamentally different thing from changing the underlying culture of an institution.</p>
<p>Trying to kick-start a deeper kind of institutional change was the aim of a 2016 Law Society of Ontario (then called the Law Society of Upper Canada) <a href="https://lawsocietyontario.azureedge.net/media/lso/media/legacy/pdf/w/working-together-for-change-strategies-to-address-issues-of-systemic-racism-in-the-legal-professions-final-report.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report</a> that investigated the challenges faced by racialized licensees. “<a href="https://lawsocietyontario.azureedge.net/media/lso/media/legacy/pdf/w/working-together-for-change-strategies-to-address-issues-of-systemic-racism-in-the-legal-professions-final-report.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Working Together for Change: Strategies to Address Issues of Systemic Racism in the Legal Professions</a>” offered a suite of recommendations for making the field less hostile to lawyers of colour. One of these suggestions, for “every licensee to adopt and to abide by a statement of principles acknowledging their obligation to promote equality, diversity and inclusion,” attracted an outcry, with critics objecting to it as a form of compelled speech that violated their freedom of expression. A motion to make the statement voluntary failed, and the recommendation was later repealed entirely. A contingent of lawyers ran&mdash;successfully&mdash;for the Law Society bench, with the whole thrust of their platform being to oppose the statement of principles (SOP), calling themselves “StopSOP.” All that rancour&mdash;and, frankly, wasted time and effort&mdash;over asking lawyers to do something as cursory as admitting that diversity is okay. This is how inhospitable the industry can be: it’s comfortable gesturing to inclusion, but at the merest suggestion of something more proactive, it closes ranks.</p>
<p>Obviously, the lawyers who complained about the working group’s recommendation were inflating the threat to their speech and to their power. To oppose DEI initiatives, whether a simple statement of principles or something more concrete like a fellowship, is to treat these tools as more inherently progressive and capable of enacting large-scale change than they actually are. It is easy to paste a verbal commitment over a malign motive as a way of trying to make it look reasonable. Both legal language and expressions of diversity share this susceptibility to co-optation. Conservatives can slip it on like an ill-fitting garment, uncannily parroting familiar phrases: “I seek out individuals or jurisdictions [or] corporations who have been discriminated against in various endeavors because of their race and ethnicity,” Blum told the <em>New York Times</em>&mdash;which sounds reasonable until you realize the nominal “victims” he has in mind: straight white men and the empires they run. </p>
<p>By funnelling energy and resources toward attacking the bare minimum of equitable gestures, these positions steal our attention away from more effective methods of making organizations more equitable&mdash;methods like, say, affirmative action. The closed loop of making and shouting down statements professing to what you’re <em>going</em> to do is theatre that distracts from actually having to do it. For proof of the so-called power of a statement of principles, consider this: while every sector was putting out diversity statements in the latter half of 2020, the US Supreme Court was being stacked, and right-wing legal activists were mobilizing to topple one of the most powerful tools for actually addressing the field’s epidemic of whiteness. Too many people were looking in the wrong direction.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/affirmative-action-law-firms/">The Next Target in the War on Affirmative Action?

The “1 Million March 4 Children” was organized by a handful of right-wing and religious groups ostensibly united by a mission to protect children from “indoctrination and sexualization.” From Victoria to Sudbury to Charlottetown, they gathered with signs proclaiming the various dangers of godlessness, pedophilia, public schools, unions, Justin Trudeau, and COVID-19 vaccines. Other signs bore the simple message “Protect parental rights.”</p>
<p>The amorphous refrain of “parental rights” has been ubiquitous lately. In June, New Brunswick education and early childhood development minister Bill Hogan announced changes to the provincial LGBTQI2S+ policy that would require schools to get parental consent before allowing a child under sixteen to change their name or pronouns, saying that “parents deserve to be respected.” In August, Saskatchewan minister of education Dustin Duncan implemented a similar policy, affirming “the important role that parents and guardians have in protecting and supporting their children.” At an event in Ontario, which has not yet amended any education policies, premier Doug Ford told supporters, “Most important is the parents’ rights&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;it’s not up to the teachers, it’s not up to the school boards, to indoctrinate our kids.” In September, then Manitoba premier Heather Stefanson promised to enhance parental rights in schools but dodged questions on what precisely that would entail. And this month, Saskatchewan premier Scott Moe announced he would invoke the notwithstanding clause “to pass legislation to protect parents’ rights.”</p>

</ul>
<p>The meaning of these vague declarations was made more explicit early last month at the federal Conservative Party’s policy convention, where a majority of delegates endorsed a policy that would ban children from receiving gender-affirming care, amid pleas from a convention delegate to “please protect our kids.” If that slogan sounds familiar&mdash;along with related calls to #SaveOurChildren and #LeaveOurChildrenAlone&mdash;it’s because they’re all drawn from the same poisoned well, an adaptable and durable conspiracy theory that children are being exploited by a global cabal of powerful, left-wing pedophiles.</p>
<p>Despite its innocuous label, the “parental rights” refrain did not begin with parents at all. It began, instead, with the believers of “Pizzagate,” the 2016 conspiracy theory that alleged Hillary Clinton and her aide, John Podesta, were running a child trafficking ring out of a pizza parlour in Washington, DC. When “Pizzagate” mutated into QAnon, it expanded to imply a powerful worldwide network of cannibalistic, satanic pedophiles. Believers pledged their support for Donald Trump, who was supposedly waging a secret war to save these imperilled children. A 2022 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute in the US found that 16 percent of Americans believe in the tenets of the QAnon conspiracy theory, which <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/when-qanon-came-to-canada/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">has also seeped into Canada</a>. </p>
<p>Part of what makes QAnon so resilient is its constant assimilation of other conspiracies, particularly at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as many people became convinced of shadowy efforts by the government to covertly test drugs on the public (something 31 percent of Canadians believed, according to a 2021 poll) or by Bill Gates to microchip the unwitting public through vaccines (believed by 13 percent of Canadians, according to another poll from 2022). During the isolating, anxious early months of the pandemic, QAnon’s views were also laundered through the wholesome aesthetics of social media parenting influencers, who galvanized their followers around the alleged threats to innocent children. These anxieties have intersected to create an acute moral panic, which posits that parents and “freedom fighters” must stand between their children and the constant menace of “groomers” who seek to brainwash and exploit. </p>
<p>In Canada, these conspiracy theorists have focused many of their efforts on drag shows and sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) curricula, which are allegedly the means by which children are “indoctrinated” and groomed for abuse. While it’s nothing new for some parents to object to classroom education about sex and gender identity, it’s these specific terms that connect the current tinfoil-hatted “parents’ rights” uprising to its toxic predecessors. Canadian protesters have also drawn explicit comparisons between LGBTQ2+ education and the abuse inflicted on Indigenous children in residential schools, attempting to compare a real legacy of abuse to an imaginary one. Protesters against one drag show in Mississauga even donned orange shirts emblazoned with hand prints, which evoked those worn to honour residential school survivors and victims. The victims imagined by this movement are not queer and transgender youth, who benefit from education and environments that recognize their existence and affirm their value, but ostensibly children who have somehow been corrupted by learning about the existence of these peers. There is no evidence that LGBTQ2+ education harms cisgender youth, while for their transgender peers, it can be life saving: transgender youth are more than seven times as likely to attempt suicide as cisgender youth, and LGBTQ2+ education in schools has been shown to decrease that risk. </p>
<p>That Canadian politicians are reciting the latest talking points from a deranged and dangerous conspiracy is as baffling as it is alarming. But unlike references to satanic elites harvesting the blood of children, the rhetoric of “parental rights” is delicately calibrated to avoid raising the alarm among moderate voters while also masquerading as a representation of the average Canadian’s concerns. However, according to the <a href="https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/new-brunswick-education-department-received-no-complaints-about-pronouns-kept-secret-1.6502512" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Canadian Press</a>, a University of New Brunswick professor’s right to information request found that not a single parent in the province had emailed the education ministry with concerns about not being consulted regarding their child’s use of a different name or pronouns. An investigation by the province’s Child and Youth Advocate found that just three individuals had emailed the education ministry about LGBTQI2S+ content in schools, none of which were legitimate complaints or specifically referenced the policy, despite minister Hogan’s claim that he had received “hundreds” of complaints.</p>
<p>By playing along, as BC United party leader Kevin Falcon did when he <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/bc-politicians-anti-sogi-rallies-launch-across-canada" rel="noopener" target="_blank">told reporter Katie DeRosa</a> that protesters have “legitimate concerns,” politicians are sending clear signals to the conspiracy theorists who cluster on the far right of the political spectrum that they are willing to indulge their beliefs, if doing so will bolster their odds of winning the next election. </p>
<p>Even if one were to ignore the swamp of delusional thinking that birthed the “parental rights” movement and argue that perhaps parents do deserve to know what’s happening in their children’s lives&mdash;even if those children would prefer not to tell them&mdash;they might find that this desire is on shaky legal ground. Florence Ashley, an assistant professor in the faculty of law at the University of Alberta and adjunct associate professor at the John Dossetor Health Ethics Centre, points out that Canadian law affirms that children are people, not the property of their parents or anyone else. Canada is also a signatory to the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child, which includes their rights to freedom of thought, freedom of expression, and personal privacy. Parental authority, Ashley says, is about recognizing the unique role of parents in supporting their children and protecting them from harm. It would be challenging to prove that prohibiting them from using the name and pronouns that align with their identity&mdash;decisions that are widely supported by medical professionals, including the Canadian Paediatric Society&mdash;is in their best interests. </p>
<p>According to some critics, the provincial policies may well be in conflict with rights guaranteed under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, such as the right to liberty and equality. On September 6, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association filed a lawsuit against New Brunswick for violating those constitutional rights, one week after a community organization filed a similar lawsuit in Saskatchewan. But what’s worrisome, Ashley says, is Saskatchewan’s invocation of the notwithstanding clause to force its “parental rights” policy through. “Here you have a government that wants to override human rights as part of a moral panic,” says Ashley. “That’s a deeply concerning development.”</p>
<p>While Canadian law does recognize that parents have some authority over their children, Ashley says, that authority is contingent on acting in the child’s best interests. Introducing “parental rights” policies might sound like a solution to parents who wish to control their child’s identity, but such policies may introduce new problems. “We don’t want a situation where you have a parent who vetoes their child’s use of name and pronouns and then ends up having to go to custody court or to a child protection hearing because they’re disallowing something that’s in the best interest of the child and making a decision is going to be harmful for the child,” says Ashley. </p>
<p>The unfortunate truth is that parents do not always have their child’s best interests at heart, and many children are not safe at home. The majority of Canadians who suffered physical abuse as children endured it at the hands of a parent or step-parent. For all the fear mongering about predatory teachers, children are fifteen times more likely to experience sexual abuse at the hands of family members. And transgender youth report far higher rates of both physical and sexual violence compared to cisgender peers. “All these policies do is empower parents who are transphobic parents,” says Ashley. “[They’re] prejudiced parents who are going to harm their children, and [it’s] granting them a legal authority to do so.” </p>
<p>By mid-morning on September 20, it was clear the #1MillionMarchers had overestimated their numbers; in a livestream from the Ottawa march, a participant complained that they had been surrounded by a much larger group that had gathered in support of trans rights. In Victoria, Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Halifax, and several other cities, the marchers were vastly outnumbered by counter protesters. It was also clear that the veneer of “parental rights” as a movement grounded in genuine concern for the well-being of children had cracked, revealing its ugly foundations: in Ottawa, one protester draped a Nazi flag on a memorial to Indigenous veterans, while another in Vancouver alleged that Jews were behind the abuse of children. </p>
<p>It will be tougher now for the politicians who have spoken up for “parents’ rights” to pretend that they are not pandering to the radicalized fringes of Canadian society. The rest of us can agree that protecting children is important. What’s even more important is recognizing their right to protect themselves.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/parents-rights-conspiracy-theories/">“Parents’ Rights” Rhetoric Is Rooted in Radical Conspiracy Theories</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

The caterpillar, an impatient sort, grills a confused Alice on who she is and what she’s doing before telling her that eating from one side of his mushroom will cause her to grow and eating from the other will cause her to shrink (he refrains from clarifying which side is which). Alice grabs a handful of both, and her first bite diminishes her down toward the ground. The corrective bite sends her head soaring above the treetops, her neck so long that a nearby pigeon mistakes her for a serpent.</p>
<p>Alice’s experience encapsulates the weird position that mushrooms take up in our psyche: the way they occupy some borderland between the prosaic and the uncanny. They can be found in the aisles of any grocery store&mdash;rubbery white buttons tamed by plastic wrap. They’re ubiquitous in children’s books, especially fairy tales&mdash;which might be where they start to spill over into the otherworldly, since many of those illustrations depict the <em>Amanita muscaria</em>, a red mushroom with white spots, prized by Siberian shamans for its powerful hallucinogenic properties (it’s also highly toxic). Things only get wilder from there.</p>
<p>Though we typically associate mushrooms with a classic toadstool silhouette, they come in all kinds of fantastical shapes and colours. Take, for example, the jack-o’-lantern, a poisonous orange variety that glows green in the dark. There are mushrooms whose names wouldn’t sound out of place at a punk show, like witches’ butter, wolf-fart puffball, bleeding tooth, and amethyst deceiver. Then, of course, there’s the fact that fungi are a potent symbol of death, not just because eating the wrong type might kill you but also because they literally feed off decay. Most fungi survive by decomposing material around them&mdash;not only feeding themselves in the process but clearing away lifeless organic material so that more things can grow. Because of that, mushrooms could also be seen as symbols of rebirth, creating space for new life by doing away with the dead. </p>

</ul>
<p>Maybe that sense of renewal is part of why mushrooms are having a bona fide moment right now, one that straddles several wildly different sectors. In late 2021, the <em>New York Times</em> predicted that mushrooms would be the 2022 ingredient of the year, which makes sense given that the global market for edible fungi rose to $45.3 billion (US) in 2020 and is projected to reach $62.2 billion (US) this year. Meanwhile, advancing technology means we’re finding more applications for fungi, from the seemingly frivolous (high fashion “mushroom leather”) to the potentially groundbreaking (fungus that feeds off radiation and might be used to clean up nuclear waste or protect astronauts in space). In medicine, more and more studies are being done on the use of psilocybin to treat depression, anxiety, and even substance use disorder. Mushrooms are also becoming increasingly popular as a supplement, touting benefits like improved immunity, cognitive function, and energy.</p>
<p>When I first had the idea to write about mushrooms, I thought it would be a light trend piece&mdash;something like “mushrooms are so hot right now, how interesting!” But what started out as general journalistic curiosity sent me down a trail of increasingly amazing facts, one that has led me to question so many things I thought I knew about the natural world and our place in it&mdash;an identity crisis similar to the one Alice experiences as she journeys through Wonderland. It’s clear that mycologists have only just begun their journey down the rabbit hole, and the applications for mushrooms are seemingly endless. And it seems that the more we learn about fungi, the more we learn about our own values and connections. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="smallcaps">ast year</span>, when Deb Kelly led me through her Yarker, Ontario, mushroom farm, the Fungi Connection, I couldn’t decide whether it reminded me more of an industrial warehouse or some sci-fi laboratory. Dominating the entryway was a homemade sterilization unit, a hulking metal thing that blasted steam through the bags of hardwood sawdust in which the mushrooms would grow. From there, we passed into a room with hospital-grade HEPA filters, where the shelves were lined with dozens of petri dishes, each containing a bit of mushroom culture that was grown in a test tube. This was where the cultures would be mixed with sterilized grain in order to form the mycelium, which is the root-like structure out of which mushrooms develop, and everything had to be as clean as possible. Even the tiniest contaminant could ruin an entire batch.</p>
<p>Once the grain was colonized by the mycelium, it could be added to the sawdust bags&mdash;these mushrooms are all wood decomposers, so that will be their food&mdash;and then moved to the incubation room, a warm, dim purgatory that it must journey through before its final stop: the fruiting room. </p>
<p>“This is the part that a lot of people get most excited about,” Kelly told me as she opened the door. I could see why. In this light-, humidity-, and temperature-controlled space, designed to mimic the conditions of the forest floor, row upon row of sawdust bags burst with fantastical shapes: oyster mushrooms in shades of beige, eerie indigo sprout-like clusters of tiny flying saucers, and lion’s mane mushrooms frothing out of their containers with long, white spines that looked like shaggy hair. </p>
<p>It’s hard to describe the surreal feeling of the fruiting room&mdash;it was a bit like stepping into another world. It also felt like looking into the future, which, in a way, it just might be.</p>
<p>When Kelly and her husband, Darren, founded the Fungi Connection in 2017 at a farm they were renting on Wolfe Island, they thought it would take them at least five years to build some kind of following. To their surprise, they were soon supplying mushrooms to restaurants across Eastern Ontario and selling their goods at several local fine food shops and farmers’ markets. In the years since, they’ve had to move twice to larger digs thanks to skyrocketing demand&mdash;though in the months since I visited, they’ve decided to sell their large farm and scale back to a smaller homestead.      </p>
<p>One of the Fungi Connection’s most popular products has been a kit that allows people to cultivate their own mushrooms at home. As it turns out, you don’t need a lot of space or fancy equipment to grow mushrooms. In fact, the use of old factories and warehouses as urban mushroom farms is on the rise. Blanc de Gris in Montreal, one example of this model, has put an extra eco-friendly spin on the idea by using residual grain from local beer production as part of its cultivation.</p>
<p>When it comes to food, mushrooms have many benefits in an age of climate change. They’re chock-full of nutrients and make an appealing meat substitute. (Despite being a staple in many vegetarian diets, mushrooms aren’t vegetables; they share more genetic traits with animals and belong to their own separate biological kingdom.) Compared to other crops, they require fewer growing materials, water, and energy while also taking up a fraction of the square footage. Because they don’t need significant access to land and are relatively inexpensive, easy, and quick to cultivate, mushrooms could also potentially help address food insecurity, particularly in urban environments.</p>
<p>The Kellys cultivate a number of varieties, including shiitake, black king, reishi, chestnut, the aforementioned lion’s mane, and four variants of oyster mushrooms: blue, pink, golden, and white. Almost all of these could be used to make satisfying meatless stir fries, pasta sauces, gravies, soups, or stews. (I have a great recipe somewhere for mushroom bourguignon.) Some mushrooms, though, are able to mimic the texture and flavour of actual meat. Lion’s mane, for example, is a great replacement for crabmeat, lobster, and some types of fish; it works well in “lobster” rolls and vegetarian gumbo. Then there’s the variety <em>Laetiporus</em>, which some people call “chicken of the woods.” As its nickname suggests, <em>Laetiporus</em> makes an incredible chicken substitute, whether you bread it and deep-fry it or turn it into a simple soup. Then there’s mycoprotein, which is a meat substitute made out of protein derived from fungi. You can find mycoprotein products in supermarkets under the brand name Quorn. Personally, though, my favourite mushroom dishes are those where the mushroom isn’t trying to be anything other than its own delicious self.</p>
<p>As I was leaving the Fungi Connection, Deb handed me a paper bag filled with oyster and lion’s mane mushrooms. I felt like I’d won the lottery. I used the oyster ones to make a beautifully creamy risotto, and on Kelly’s recommendation, I decided to try my hand at lion’s mane “crab cakes.” I made them for my mother and served them with a fancy lemon aioli. Both of us thought they tasted just like real crab cakes. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smallcaps">ne of the most fascinating</span> recent innovations in the world of fungi is so-called vegan mushroom leather (which is actually made from mycelium). This hot new trend in luxury apparel has designers like Hermès and Stella McCartney incorporating it into their products, and it could potentially upend fashion both high and low.</p>
<p>Artist Philip Ross first learned about reishi mushrooms when he worked as a hospice caregiver in San Francisco during the AIDS epidemic; interested in their immune-boosting properties, he began growing them for medicinal use. He soon started using them in his sculptures and eventually began experimenting with materials made from the organism’s mycelium. After fielding interest from multiple companies about the technology he was developing, Ross and long-time artistic collaborator Sophia Wang founded MycoWorks in order to commercialize it and wound up focusing on creating a plant-based leather alternative. Designers say it’s indistinguishable from the real thing.</p>
<p>Mushroom leather has many things working in its favour, the biggest one being that it’s cruelty free. It’s also more eco-friendly than both leather and the majority of leather alternatives: mushrooms don’t come close to stressing the environment the way that rearing cattle and other animals does, the tanning process doesn’t use chromium (a pollutant historically used to tan hides), and it’s not made from plastic, unlike “pleather” (leather-like products made from polyurethane or polyvinyl chloride). Mushroom leather can also be combined with other fibres, like cotton, and customized to a much higher degree than real leather.</p>
<p>The only drawback is the price. In an interview with the <em>New York Times</em> in late 2022, Ross would not put an exact number to the cost of his product, but he did say that it was comparable to that of exotic hides. There’s a reason that mushroom leather lies (at least so far) firmly within the domain of luxury apparel: no one else can afford to work with it. But other companies are quickly developing their own mushroom leather technologies, and MycoWorks is ever growing. It’s possible to imagine a future where mushroom leather is mainstream. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smallcaps">ushrooms might</span> currently be associated with wealth and health, but they haven’t always been viewed so positively in the Western world. Just a few hundred years ago, Europeans had a much darker take on them.</p>
<p>“Mushrooms were always about the night side of nature,” says Mike Jay, author of <em>Psychonauts: Drugs and the Making of the Modern Mind</em>, about historical Western attitudes toward psychedelic plants and organisms. In his native Britain, they are associated with fairy rings, naturally occurring circles of mushrooms that spring up in forests or meadows. These were said to be made by fairies, mischievous and spiteful little imps, to dance in. </p>
<p>A fairy ring was a dangerous place, and an errant human who stumbled into one might find themself whisked away to fairyland&mdash;or worse. Of course, transportation to another world is exactly what some people hope to get from ingesting certain mushrooms.</p>
<p>The term “magic mushroom” was coined in 1957 by <em>Life</em> magazine. In that issue, R. Gordon Wasson, a vice president at J.&thinsp;P. Morgan, detailed his participation in a Mazatec mushroom ritual. Wasson, whose Russian American wife and co-author, Valentina, had first interested him in mushrooms during their honeymoon, claimed to be the pioneering Westerner to have undergone such a ceremony; in fact, he had lied his way into it by claiming to the woman conducting it, a curandera named María Sabina, that he was looking for information about his son. Wasson also reneged on his promise not to publicize identifying information about Sabina, something that had devastating consequences for her. The essay, however, proved to be an enormous sensation, one that Wasson followed up on by collecting and identifying various species of psilocybin mushrooms and publishing about them. If Timothy Leary and Ram Dass were the godfathers of the psychedelic ’60s, then Wasson might be a close third.</p>
<p>Few people understand the impact of Wasson’s work more than Ron Shore, a sort of Renaissance mushroom man from Kingston, Ontario. I first contacted him because he owned a brewery (since sold) that created a beer containing chaga mushrooms, which have been said to lower inflammation and prevent cancer and are often used in alternative medicine and supplements. I was interested in what seemed like yet another strange new use for fungi. As it turned out, I got much more than I’d bargained for: Shore was also involved in the founding of the Kingston Psychedelic Society and recently completed a PhD in the clinical application of psilocybin mushrooms. (The beer, by the way, was delicious.)</p>
<p>“There’s a bit of a trickster element to mushrooms, a shadow side, an underground intelligence,” says Shore, who works as a research scientist under Jane Philpott at Queen’s University. He’s happy to talk about the neuroscience of psilocybin-assisted therapy, the reviews he’s conducted, the papers he’s publishing. This form of psychotherapy is still relatively new, but studies have shown it could be very effective in treating issues like depression, end-of-life anxiety, and substance use disorders. While the sale of psilocybin mushrooms is still illegal in Canada, Health Canada has authorized the use of psilocybin in psychedelic-assisted therapy through its Special Access Program. It’s still early days when it comes to any kind of treatment involving psychedelics, but initial results seem promising.</p>
<p>Shore’s a bona fide scientist, but his interest comes across as more mystical than academic. He views mushrooms as intelligent beings, which accords with the research biologist Merlin Sheldrake did for his hit book <em>Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds, and Shape Our Futures</em>. It turns out that networks of mycelium, which can stretch for miles underground, in some ways resemble brains. They’re able to transmit information, respond to their environment, and adapt to change in a way that science is only just beginning to understand. </p>
<p>“The brain’s architecture is exactly like the way mycelium grows,” Shore tells me. “It’s exactly the same branching network patterns. We’re all so used to this world that’s somehow a duality between body and spirit and all this, but in the real world, everything’s so connected. We don’t even know where one species starts and another ends, or where one tree starts and another ends, or where a mushroom starts and a tree ends.”</p>
<p>Shore often speaks in these kinds of terms: about how fungi connect to themselves and the wider natural world, but also how they can help people connect to themselves or those around them. Kelly, who calls herself a mushroom evangelist, does the same, adding that the more she learns about fungi, the more she feels there’s a spiritual component to her work. She’s certainly not the only mushroom enthusiast to speak about them with a kind of holy awe. </p>
<p>Jay feels a similar sense of wonder about fungi and refers to their current moment as a point of “infinite possibility.” But he also worries that there is a sort of uncritical championing happening around them&mdash;a sense that people might be overpromising what they can deliver based on science that is really only just starting to understand how it exists in the world and what it can do. That feels like a fair assessment: Could anything really live up to the current mushroom hype? We want so badly to discover a silver bullet that will solve all of our problems&mdash;climate change, food insecurity, mental and physical illness&mdash;and we tend to be quick to discard ideas if they don’t work out exactly the way we want them to.</p>
<p>Still, Jay feels encouraged by the fact that researchers could seize the “mushroom cheerleading” opportunity to create long-term plans, telling me he hopes it will lead to more funding and research into the effects on the human mind.</p>
<p>When most people think about the mushroom that Alice finds in Wonderland, they’ll probably remember its more fantastical elements: the fact that it’s the seat of a talking, smoking caterpillar or the way it causes Alice’s rapid changes in size. What they might not remember is that, by this point in the narrative, Alice has already grown and shrunk uncontrollably, which is why she’s on eye level with the caterpillar to begin with. Alice eats the mushroom to try to restore herself to her regular size&mdash;which, after some trial and error, she manages to do. She holds on to pieces of the mushroom as she moves on, using them as tools to help her navigate the strange new world.</p>
<p>With a little luck and a lot of investment, maybe fungi can do the same for us.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-mushroom-boom/">The Mushroom Boom</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

As I walked around, he woke up and let out a piercing wail. I was already pivoting his stroller toward the exit when an employee looked up at me. “Oh,” she said knowingly, “that’s a new-baby cry.” She and another employee rushed to gaze at my furious, tiny baby while I prepared to apologize. “Mine never liked the stroller either,” she said. “Would you like me to hold him while you shop?” </p>
<p>I’ve often been struck by the unexpected generosity of strangers toward my babies, perhaps because I’ve absorbed the rhetoric that a noisy child is a blight on society. Recently, in Vancouver, a furious debate erupted online after an application to expand a daycare in a residential neighbourhood was denied, partly on the grounds that nearby residents objected to the noise. “I can’t escape the noise currently, so if she were to expand this daycare, we would have no peace,” one person argued in a hearing, <a href="https://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/dan-fumano-vancouver-neighbourhood-organizes-to-fight-and-defeat-childcare-facility" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as reported</a> by journalist Dan Fumano. His column in the <em>Vancouver Sun</em> ignited an online firestorm of opprobrium, much of it from dismayed parents chasing the pipe dream of securing a child care spot (Vancouver has <a href="https://policyalternatives.ca/newsroom/news-releases/some-bc-child-care-fee-increases-among-highest-canada" rel="noopener" target="_blank">only one space</a> for every five three-to-five-year-olds). But there was an undercurrent of sympathy for the aggrieved neighbours. “Children don’t just laugh,” columnist Sandy Garossino asserted on social media, while radio host Buzz Bishop complained about living next door to a daycare: “It’s eternal toddler preschool noise and it’s very irritating.” </p>

<p>It’s true: children, especially babies, make noise. Many people would say kids are fine if they are quiet and unobtrusive&mdash;which is to say, if they don’t behave at all like kids. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Travel/southwest-passengers-outburst-crying-baby-caught-camera/story?id=98717836" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Earlier this year</a>, a Southwest Airlines passenger had a meltdown over a crying baby, captured in a TikTok video that went viral. Airplanes are designed to maximize discomfort and unwanted intimacy, and as such, they’re a frequent locus of anti-baby sentiment. “You’re yelling,” a flight attendant cautions, and the man screams, “So is the baby! Did this motherfucker pay extra to yell?” On video, it’s comedic; in person, it’s every parent’s worst nightmare: becoming the target of society’s mounting intolerance toward children. Even when they’re happy, babies are often unwelcome. On a Reddit forum titled “Am I the Asshole”&mdash;a crowdsourced gauge of social mores&mdash;one user recently asked whether making their infant laugh in a restaurant was rude, particularly since another diner asked them to stop. The prevailing sentiment was yes. “There’s nothing wrong with your kid laughing, but there’s a time and a place for it,” one poster replied. </p>
<p>What is the time and place for children? Often, the pro- and anti-child camps split along the question of whether or not kids are, fundamentally, annoying. Many people are quick to argue that the sounds of children are beautiful and life affirming. While I appreciate people sticking up for crying babies, I also think it’s the wrong question. The right one is whether children are members of society, or whether we should treat them less like people and more like dogs (to whom they are compared frequently).</p>

</ul>
<p>In some cultures, the answer to this question is implicit. <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/indigenous/">Indigenous</a> spaces tend to be very baby friendly, and the idea of censuring a child for shrieking is unthinkable among my Indigenous friends and family. You see babies at every ceremony and event, which makes their presence unremarkable. They’re part of the community, and everyone shares in the task of looking out for them. Many other cultures outside of North America have a similarly inclusive approach; when my husband and I visited Japan, we marvelled at groups of unescorted schoolchildren. The long-running Japanese show <em>Old Enough!</em>, which features children embarking on their first independent errands, captivated viewers when it hit Netflix in 2022 with its vision of a society where toddlers might venture out alone to the grocery store. </p>
<p>The prevailing North American attitude views letting your child out of your sight momentarily as negligence, while approaching a child you don’t know is similarly taboo. In 2017, a single father in Vancouver <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7145065/vancouver-dad-appeal-kids-bus-alone/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was investigated</a> by the Ministry of Family and Child Services for letting his children, who ranged in age from seven to eleven, take the bus to school alone after he had spent two years teaching them how to navigate transit. There are <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/01/maryland-parents-investigated-by-the-police-for-letting-their-kids-walk-home-alone.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">similar stories</a> of American parents investigated and even arrested for letting their kids walk home alone from parks or playgrounds. These incidents underscore how conditional the participation of children in society is; even when they are quiet and orderly, some adults will remind them that they do not belong.</p>
<p>While the most vehement anti-child positions are the fringe views of a small but vocal minority, the rejected Vancouver daycare is an example of a real-world impact, one that compounds the challenges of parenting without social support. Parenting is already a hard and lonely gig, one that got harder and lonelier during the pandemic. But it’s not just parents who are feeling isolated. In 2021, four in ten Canadians <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/211124/dq211124e-eng.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> feeling lonely some or all of the time. The pandemic insulated us from regular human contact, and many have emerged with a heightened sensitivity to others. Everyone else seems louder, more annoying, more obtrusive. The <em>New York Times</em>, investigating the growing phenomenon of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/01/business/customer-service-pandemic-rage.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">consumer rage</a>,” pointed to the “frictionless economy” of online, depersonalized transactions as one cause: many of us have been sold on the idea that our daily lives should be populated with easy, efficient, painless transactions and interactions. And children, in all their irrepressible raucousness, are friction. The transactional nature of modern life has led many adults to believe that if they are paying for a restaurant meal, an airline seat, or a house in a nice neighbourhood, they should be entitled to dictate the terms of their experience&mdash;and to exclude those who disrupt it. </p>
<p>This is an impoverished and self-defeating perspective. We all begin our lives dependent on the tenderness of adults, and if we’re very lucky, we’ll grow old enough to rely on others’ care again. At any point in between, we may become disabled or ill, or we may experience a mental health crisis, a serious injury, or just a really bad day. It’s only temporary good fortune that prevents any of us from becoming the friction in someone else’s existence. When we inevitably do, we should hope that others treat us with compassion. Enjoying a serene restaurant meal is nice, but it is in our collective self-interest to cultivate a more tolerant society.</p>
<p>At the consignment store, I thanked the shop employee for her offer to hold my baby and took him outside in the sun to soothe him. These moments of spontaneous kindness from strangers linger in my mind: a young man wordlessly lifting the front wheels of my stroller over a high curb; a fellow passenger whispering, “You deserve a glass of wine,” after my baby cried through forty-five minutes of a flight; a grandfather at the playground kneeling to gently wiggle my daughter’s shoe back onto her foot. To brush against one another’s insufferable humanity and turn toward it with kindness rather than irritation is, to me, the substance of community. Sometimes that humanity is loud, but it’s always beautiful. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/big-babies-when-it-comes-to-kids-many-adults-need-to-grow-up/">Big Babies: When It Comes to Kids, Many Adults Need to Grow Up</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>
