		<description><![CDATA[Research suggests trailblazing art gallery director Ferdinand Eckhardt may have been a supporter of the Third Reich]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1600" height="1067" src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Sweatman_FerdinandEckhardt_1800.jpeg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="A photo illustration of three black-and-white photos of former Winnipeg Art Gallery director Ferdinand Eckhardt hung up on a dark red wall in black frames." style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="" srcset="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Sweatman_FerdinandEckhardt_1800.jpeg 1600w, https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Sweatman_FerdinandEckhardt_1800-735x490.jpeg 735w, https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Sweatman_FerdinandEckhardt_1800-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Sweatman_FerdinandEckhardt_1800-1200x800.jpeg 1200w, https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Sweatman_FerdinandEckhardt_1800-348x232.jpeg 348w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smallcaps">n July 5, 1973,</span> a German ethnographer named Karl Stumpp stood in the Winnipeg Art Gallery and delivered a lecture called “The Fate of the Russian Germans.” Stumpp was on a speaking tour across Canada, and his Winnipeg stop was highly anticipated. A key figure in “Germans from Russia” studies, he was admired by a network of North American academics and Germanophiles, many of whom treated his wartime research as foundational. The lecture’s subject&mdash;ethnic Germans in Eastern Europe and their abuse at the hands of the Soviet Union&mdash;would also have struck a chord with the city’s large German community, some of whom had fled communist persecution.</p>
<p>The WAG advertised the free public event in its 1973 event calendar, and the city’s Canadian German newspapers promoted it. But one would be hard pressed to find mention of the lecture anywhere else. One reason might be that Stumpp, as is more widely known today, was a Nazi whose legacy is inextricably linked to the Final Solution. His authority on the lecture’s subject rested largely on surveys of German Ukrainian villages he’d overseen in the 1940s in Nazi-occupied Ukraine. This occupation gave Stumpp unique access to German communities hitherto hidden behind Soviet borders. But his studies were decidedly not of the disinterested scientific variety. After Einsatzgruppen killing squads cleansed a village of “undesirables,” Stumpp’s own eighty-man action unit moved in to determine the survivors’ racial character. Those deemed lacking sufficient “German blood” were likely murdered, helping rid the Greater Reich of what Stumpp’s diaries describe as “the Bolshevik-Jewish plague.” </p>

</ul>
<p>It’s apparent from their writings that, by 1973, many of Stumpp’s closest North American colleagues understood his research was pursued within the Nazi apparatus, even if they were sketchy on certain details. This understanding was shared by at least one Winnipeg professor involved with organizing Stumpp’s lecture tour in Canada. Enough was also made known publicly about Stumpp’s past that a German article promoting the WAG event could advertise him as managing director of the People’s Association for Germans Abroad (1933–1938) and head of the Research Center for Russian Germans (1938–1945)&mdash;job titles, given their time frames, that practically Sieg Heil off the page. </p>
<p>What knowledge did WAG’s management have of Stumpp’s genocidal associations at the time of his lecture? Was his presence at the gallery, an elegant modernist space that had opened less than two years earlier, simply a matter of oversight? Posing such questions some fifty years later would seem less significant if it weren’t for another virtually unknown fact: Austrian-born Ferdinand Eckhardt, the trailblazing WAG director in charge at the time&mdash;and who, the local newspaper <em>Courier Nordwesten</em> reports, attended Stumpp’s lecture as an “honoured guest”&mdash;was himself a Nazi fellow traveller during the Third Reich. </p>
<p>Eckhardt’s public endorsements of Nazism include signing an oath of allegiance to Hitler and producing several polemics in far-right and Nazified journals in the early 1930s, urging, among other things, that Germany’s cultural arena align itself with the goals of the Nazi state. Eckhardt went to work for one of the most notorious players in Hitler’s war machine, IG Farben, the same company that built the Auschwitz concentration camp and manufactured Zyklon-B, used in the gas chambers to kill over 2.5 million people. Eckhardt hid his Nazi statements, but they have cropped up in the margins and footnotes of Nazi cultural histories for years. They are summarized at some length by German art historian Andreas Zeising, whose profile of Eckhardt in his 2018 book, <em><a href="https://www.vandenhoeck-ruprecht-verlage.com/themen-entdecken/kunst-und-architektur/kunstgeschichte-kunstwissenschaft/50300/radiokunstgeschichte" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Radiokunstgeschichte</a></em>, has yet to make a notable impression on Canadian commentary, perhaps partially because it has not been translated. (When reached for comment, the WAG stressed that they have no knowledge of Eckhardt’s Nazi past and that it’s “highly unlikely the [WAG’s hiring] committee would have selected someone with any connection to the Nazis.”) </p>
<p>What Eckhardt knew of Stumpp’s complicity with mass murder has yet to be determined. But the episode raises further questions about the extent to which one of the country’s most pioneering art gallery directors had outgrown his far-right politics by the time he led central Canada’s pre-eminent arts institution. The relevance of such questions isn’t just fodder for social media campaigns to have names changed on this hall or that library. For all the popular talk today, in the fine arts world and beyond, of “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” the museum world has a Nazi problem. For a gang of brutes and supposed philistines, the Nazis were unusually interested in aesthetics, an appetite their regime helped satisfy by plundering some 600,000 works from Jewish people. An estimated 100,000 of these haven’t been returned to their rightful owners, and many of them are still possessed and displayed by Western museums&mdash;some, likely, in Canada. But as Eckhardt’s and Stumpp’s cases show, artworks weren’t the only Nazi exports hosted by Canadian museums. </p>
<p>This fall, now-resigned Liberal house speaker Anthony Rota prompted the House of Commons, and visiting Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to join him in unwittingly applauding a Waffen-SS ex-member living in Canada. Social media lit up with mockery of Liberal naivety and incompetence. But this has given way to more soul searching about Canada’s troubling record of providing haven to thousands of alleged Nazi expats. From accusations of actively encouraging suspected Nazis to resettle here to later dragging their heels on prosecuting war criminals, governments from both sides of the aisle have a lot to answer for.  </p>
<p>A thoroughgoing discussion about the relationship of Canadian museums to Nazism could knit these themes together, probing to see how many Nazi expats worked in Canada’s cultural sector, shaping public programming, museum collections, and the country’s culture and memory through the postwar period. In Eckhardt, we have a disquieting case of a Nazi sympathizer who enjoyed such influence. It’s time Canadians confronted this fact. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="smallcaps">erdinand Eckhardt</span> (1902–1995) and his wife, Sophie-Carmen Eckhardt-Gramatté (1898–1974), are among Canada’s most legendary artistic couples. They’re also parental figures in modernism’s birth in the Canadian prairies. Modernism, an originally European tradition, is sometimes imagined as a sort of negative image of fascism&mdash;a perception encouraged by the Nazis’ persecution of this movement. Modernism arrived late to the Canadian prairies, and in architecture, visual arts, and music, Eckhardt and his wife were among its key shepherds. So it’s easy to see why, for Canadians wondering about Eckhardt’s Third Reich–era politics, his achievements may have thrown many off the scent.  </p>
<p>A short summary of the couple’s careers might be helpful to the general reader. Though Eckhardt-Gramatté was a virtuoso on both piano and violin, her celebrity in Canada rests primarily on her stature as one of our greatest composers. After the death of her famous expressionist artist husband, Walter Gramatté, she married Eckhardt, an arts critic–cum–advertising manager, in 1934. In 1942, Eckhardt was conscripted into the German Army. Amid the war’s climax, Eckhardt still found time to cultivate a salon-like atmosphere in their Vienna home. In <em><a href="https://uofmpress.ca/books/detail/music-from-within" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Music from Within</a></em>, Eckhardt’s biography of his wife, he describes hosting house concerts in 1943 where “[s]trangers as well as good friends attended; Nazis and Jews rubbed shoulders. All were linked by a love of music.” </p>
<p>In postwar Vienna, Eckhardt-Gramatté cemented her reputation as a leading composer, and her husband worked in art education for the Art History Museum. However, according to Eckhardt, he grew alienated from the Vienna art world. He later remarks, “My way of thinking was much too advanced.” Clearly, his unease also owed something to the fact that the museum’s “arrogant” director suspected him of being a Nazi, which, Eckhardt notes, caused him professional troubles. Eckhardt denied the accusation but convinced his wife to move overseas to an isolated prairie city where he had been offered a job as Winnipeg Art Gallery director. </p>
<p>Eckhardt-Gramatté’s early impressions of the city were said to be unflattering; she first regarded Winnipeg as a cultural backwater. The late-blooming Eckhardt, meanwhile, at the time in his fifties, finally came into his own, professionally, in Winnipeg. Under his impressive tenure as the WAG’s director (1953–1974), for which he was inducted into the Order of Canada, the institution grew from a two-employee gallery to the prairie beacon of fine art it is today. It was under Eckhardt that the main WAG facility, a 110,000-square-foot triangular mass of Manitoba Tyndall Stone and an icon of prairie modernism, was built. </p>
<p>Boasting personal ties to top German expressionists and the great Jewish artist Marc Chagall, Eckhardt led the charge in putting European and Canadian modern art in front of Winnipeg. He’s also said to have spearheaded the WAG’s collection of Inuit art, now the world’s largest of its kind. Eckhardt-Gramatté ultimately plunged into her new milieu, developing strong ties with various orchestras and leaving behind one of Canada’s most significant bodies of classical music. She is the subject of multiple books, documentaries, and even a play performed in Toronto in spring 2023. </p>
<p>Both Eckhardt and Eckhardt-Gramatté remain honoured figures in Canada, with libraries, halls, a foundation, a music competition, and an eminent art collection bearing at least one of their names. Eckhardt’s stature isn’t just based on his accomplishments but on what he seemingly represents: the triumphant spread of modernism and cosmopolitanism over a provincial “hinterland” like Manitoba, with stops along the way to spotlight the best in local colour and to amplify Indigenous voices. In short, the “march of progress” in a way Canadians may like to imagine it. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">E</span><span class="smallcaps">ckhardt’s image </span> as an unrelenting champion of modernism, and German expressionism in particular, lends him a brave and subversive air relative to National Socialism’s violent attacks on the movement. It’s an image he encouraged&mdash;and one still given a stamp of approval today by the media and arts world. But significant omissions during the ’30s exist in his official bibliography. We have historian Andreas Zeising, primarily, to thank for recovering and filling in the relevant gaps. </p>
<p>As Zeising documents, over nearly ten articles and statements between 1932 and 1934, Eckhardt expressed mounting zeal for the national revolution occurring in Germany. So fierce were his polemics against a decadent art world, calling for a “clean up” by a strong state, he alienated even many of his conservative peers. Eckhardt’s articles run together many of the usual tropes of Nazi cultural politics. They evoke a corrupt elite&mdash;associated variously with individualism, liberalism, lack of national sentiment, commercialism, abstraction, and art for art’s sake&mdash;which he pits against an idealized German “Volk,” a racially exclusive category in Nazi ideology whose true spirit is embodied in the “new state.” Eckhardt demands that the radio and museum worlds promote German folk art and conform to the goals of National Socialism in a spirit of “blood and soil.” One of their most notorious slogans, “blood and soil” is a key term in the Nazis’ justification for eugenics and territorial conquest. </p>
<p>Eckhardt’s statements in the early 1930s don’t appear to be the reluctant words of an intellectual cowed by a totalitarian state. Rather, they resound as fascist battle cries during the Third Reich’s infancy. Doubling down on his journalistic polemics, in October 1933, Eckhardt joined eighty-seven other writers in signing (roughly translated from the German) the “pledge of the most faithful allegiance” to Hitler. Spearheaded by the Prussian Academy of Arts, the appeal signalled compliance with the recently passed Editors’ Law, a key instrument for Nazi control over the publishing industry. </p>
<p>Eckhardt’s unpublished memoirs became accessible at the Archives of Manitoba this fall. In them, he comes clean about some, but not all, of his pro-Nazi and far-right polemics, particularly those that caused him lasting embarrassment. Elsewhere, Eckhardt had publicly claimed that the <em>Völkischer Beobachter</em>, the main Nazi newspaper, had once “reprinted, in mutilated form,” an article of his. Now he confesses to submitting the article directly to the newspaper but complains they amplified its antisemitic content. Eckhardt tells us that the piece was preceded by a companion article which he submitted to <em>Die Tat</em>, a leading voice of Germany’s so-called Conservative Revolution, causing a stir in the German art scene. He also admits to associating with the Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur (Militant League for German Culture)&mdash;a Nazi Party organ using thuggish Brownshirt tactics to rid German art of “degenerative Jewish and negro influences”&mdash;in whose journal, <em>Deutsche Kultur-Wacht</em>, you can find articles by Eckhardt. Also just made accessible at the archives is a folder from Eckhardt’s estate with the darkly sarcastic title “Mein Kunstkampf,” wherein Eckhardt encloses more documents relating to his pro-Nazi activities and affiliations over 1932/33.</p>
<p>For a cosmopolitan figure once so dedicated to the avant-garde, Eckhardt’s foray into Nazi politics may seem like a curiosity&mdash;a regrettable detour by a young writer who lost his composure while trying to come out on top amid the art world shakeup the Nazis were unleashing. He would hardly have been the only German modernist who, contrary to stereotype, scrambled to make himself useful to the regime. </p>
<p>But if naivety and opportunism were Eckhardt’s overarching sins as a Nazi cooperator, the pattern doesn’t stop there. Eckhardt temporarily retired as a writer, at the behest of his new employer, after joining Bayer as an advertising manager in 1933, the same year the company began its purge of Jewish employees. At that time, and until the war’s end, Bayer was a division of IG Farben, one of the Nazi-collaborating firms most complicit in the Final Solution. Cementing IG Farben’s notoriety is its centrality to the Third Reich’s Four-Year Plan (1936–1940) and, ultimately, to the Nazi war machine: its intensive use of slave labour, including the forced labour of upward of 10,000 inmates from Auschwitz, whose facilities the company helped build; its horrific experiments, with Bayer’s involvement, on concentration camp inmates; and its production of Zyklon-B, the preferred killing tool for the Nazi gas chambers. </p>
<p>When describing his career at IG Farben, Eckhardt tends to emphasize his apparently apolitical work in advertising aspirin for Bayer. Yet Eckhardt also tells us that in 1938, owing to the impending war, he was compelled to switch from advertising to the company’s “scientific division.” With war on the horizon, it’s unsurprising that IG Farben no longer had need for an aspirin adman&mdash;Eckhardt could be put to better use elsewhere in the company, whose most powerful buyer now was the Nazi state. By 1940, IG Farben was well integrated into the Nazi war machine, being a key source of the army’s drugs, fuel, explosives, and rubber, and it was employing forced labour at its production plants. Eckhardt remained at the company until mid-1942, about six months after the Final Solution had become Nazi policy, at which point he was conscripted into the German Army. But this did not end his IG Farben career. After being discharged from the army in November 1944, Eckhardt returned to Bayer, his memoirs confirm, where he was employed until the war’s end. What Eckhardt knew of IG Farben’s atrocities during the war can’t yet be said with certainty, though Peter Hayes, an eminent historian of the company, has written “the killings were an open secret within Farben.” </p>
<p>The final verdict on Eckhardt may be that, after his Nazi writings stopped, he mostly behaved in the way of many Germans&mdash;acquiescing to the status quo to survive. Eckhardt may well have regretted some of his Third Reich–era activities, for reasons of self-interest, genuine remorse, or both. And yet we shouldn’t dismiss the possibility that Eckhardt, even by his WAG career’s end, still kept faith with his earlier sensibilities and outlook.  </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="smallcaps">et’s return to our</span> opening scene: Nazi ethnographer Karl Stumpp’s lecture at the Winnipeg Art Gallery in the summer of 1973, while Eckhardt was still WAG director. Did Eckhardt greenlight the lecture? We know he attended and even mentioned it in his private journal and personal calendar. While we can’t say definitively if he had any knowledge of Stumpp’s résumé as a Nazi who worked in tandem with the SS killing squads, Stumpp’s lecture dovetails with Eckhardt’s essays of the interwar period. In them, the line between education and propaganda is blurred, and he hammers on about the need for museums to throw off their specialized, elitist orientation to promote racial consciousness among the German Volk. In this light, it doesn’t seem that surprising that a public lecture with overtones of German identity politics by another Nazi affiliate may have appealed to him. </p>
<p>In recent decades, German studies scholars have been reckoning with Stumpp’s legacy. Eckhardt’s legacy calls for a similar reckoning. The Winnipeg Art Gallery is as vital a vessel of Canada’s visual culture as any on the prairies. More work must be done to study how Eckhardt’s Nazi ideas coloured his postwar influence on this culture. This includes shedding light on the provenance records of his and his wife’s personal art collection, much of which now lives at the WAG. In 2014, the WAG joined six Canadian galleries to work with two international researchers to determine whether any artworks they possessed had been procured from looting during the Second World War. When reached for comment, the WAG claimed they found no evidence of looting. Given that a Nazi sympathizer once owned hundreds of pieces now in their collection, perhaps it’s time to more publicly clear the air on this matter.</p>
<p>How Eckhardt even managed to inveigle his way into the Canadian art world and rise to the top deserves scrutiny too. Rumours of being a Nazi trailed him across the Atlantic. In Canada, he also never hid that he’d worked at IG Farben, even if he was cagey about how he framed this career. But concerns for Jewish welfare and dignity weren’t exactly front of mind among Winnipeg&#8217;s more powerful gentile communities when Eckhardt arrived in the 1950s. Indeed, until the 1970s, Jewish people weren’t allowed as members by many of Winnipeg’s elite social clubs, which served largely as old-boy and old-girl networks for the city’s more genteel gentiles (although much energy has been spent in recent decades to overcome such overtly racial cliquiness). Were Winnipeggers mostly convinced of Eckhardt’s progressive persona, or did many look the other way when it came to his shady past? </p>
<p>If gaze averting helps explain the hospitality Eckhardt received in Manitoba, perhaps a certain credulity, too, is at work here. When those with deeply illiberal pedigrees come knocking, they often don’t present as such. They don’t necessarily cut the image of barbaric populists from the hinterland rattling their sabres outside the city gate. They may arrive with an air of modernism, multiculturalist politics, cosmopolitanism, or principled anti-Stalinism serving to disguise their dark pasts.  </p>
<p>The WAG that I know is an outstanding institution. Few organizations so admirably balance commitments to artistic excellence and social justice. But while much talk of inclusivity emanates from the WAG and so many cultural institutions today, we face hard choices about inclusivity’s limits. As the old lesson goes, at some point, a culture of tolerance, to survive, may demand intolerance for the intolerant. No precise map exists for navigating this dilemma, and a misstep could mean forfeiting values we hold sacred. But maybe we can settle on a rule of thumb: we don’t break bread with Nazis. This goes for past fellow travellers as well as card carriers&mdash;Nazis whose evils are banal as well as spectacular. In this spirit, it’s time to eject Eckhardt from our institutions’ halls of fame. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/was-the-winnipeg-art-gallery-founded-by-a-nazi/">Was the Winnipeg Art Gallery Led by a Nazi?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

A panorama of Manhattan appears, parcelled out on three screens above the stage: the southern view of the island in the mid-1970s, smaller and lonelier than today’s cityscape. The light over New York shifts from dusk to night to dawn to day as the pianist plays nineteen bars, slowing down to make way for a single crash of cymbals. A picture of a curled-up and forlorn-looking baby sheep fades in across the skyscrapers on the middle screen, and a raspy voice sings the first line of the first song of the nearly-two-hour saga ahead: “And the lamb / lies down / on Broadway.” </p>
<p>I feel the hair on my skin spring to a stand. I enter an alternate life: it is 1975, and I am at a Genesis concert. The band is performing its new double LP, <em>The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway</em>, which tells the story of Rael, a young part–Puerto Rican graffiti artist who is pulled into a shadowy world full of peril, where he is seduced by a siren and turned into a pustular beast. Peter Gabriel, the band’s lead singer, plays both Rael and his grotesque “Slipperman” alter ego, leaping from a riser and darting across the stage in jeans and a leather jacket or lurching around in a bile-coloured, boil-covered leotard and giant round head. Behind him, guitar players Mike Rutherford and Steve Hackett, keyboardist Tony Banks, and drummer Phil Collins play intricate passages of which each note is inextricable from the story.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s bizarre: it’s progressive rock. The genre emerged in the late 1960s, mostly in England, and Genesis was a founding member. So were King Crimson, Pink Floyd, Yes, and Rush. Labyrinthine songs with unexpected shifts in key and metre, stories that feature ghosts and monsters and angels and aliens&mdash;these are the staples of prog, as it’s fondly known. You have to be highly skilled&mdash;virtuosic, even&mdash;to play it; to appreciate it, you have to be more than a bit nerdy. “Supper’s Ready,” the nearly-twenty-four-minute seven-part “song” that claims the entire second side of Genesis’s 1972 record <em>Foxtrot</em>, is perhaps peak prog, with what fans have speculated are references to theology, tautology, and pop culture. Gabriel frequently changed costumes during “Supper’s Ready,” at one point wearing a red headpiece made of two three-dimensional triangles as an incarnation of the menacing forces Gog and Magog, versions of which appear in the Old and New Testaments and also the Quran. </p>

</ul>
<p>Gabriel walked away from Genesis in 1975, and Phil Collins took over as frontman. For a while, the band continued to play what I call Old Genesis songs&mdash;the material written and performed after Hackett and Collins joined, in 1970, and before Gabriel left. Collins sang them well but completely differently than Gabriel had. The costumes, the characters&mdash;all that was over, and seemingly forever. The band moved away from prog, at first perceptibly and then conclusively. By the mid-’80s, it was a pop band, keeping company on the charts with Madonna and Huey Lewis.</p>
<p>That’s when I fell in love with Old Genesis. I was in my mid-teens. It was a Sunday afternoon, and I was in the back seat of my parents’ station wagon, trying for the seventh or eighth time to read Rael’s impenetrable story inside <em>The Lamb</em>’s gatefold cover. Somewhere along the 401, I had an epiphany. I didn’t have to understand <em>The Lamb</em>. I could just accept it, absorb it, and enjoy it, in all its weirdness. Back at home, I played the record again, elated and despondent at once. Because I would never get to see my favourite band perform it live.</p>
<p>But then, miraculously, I did. In April 2022, wearing a face mask and a sweater that I had to take off repeatedly (hello, menopause), I saw an Old Genesis concert&mdash;word for word, note for note. Everything was as I’d imagined; everything was as it was&mdash;the lights, the sets, the costumes. Rutherford was even wearing the same white pants and shirt he always did. His long hair, as always, was hanging loose. But a trained eye would have caught this important difference: he was holding his guitar to the right, not the left.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n her book</span> <em>Send in the Clones</em>, Georgina Gregory suggests that a number of systems converged in the mid-to-late 1970s to give rise to the first known tribute bands. One was the gaping grief that continued to simmer for years after the 1970 breakup of the Beatles; several of the earliest tribute bands paid homage to the Fab Four. Another was the birth of stadium rock, which meant fans would never again see groups like the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin in anything like an intimate setting. And then there was the growth of a nostalgia culture around rock and roll. In its dawning days, rock music was defined by its shunning of the past; twenty years later, the hippies of the ’60s wanted to relive their youth. </p>
<p>The nostalgia around Old Genesis has a unique intensity. That incarnation of the band only really existed for about five years, and many fans missed its heyday. For us, the nostalgia is for something we didn’t experience; it’s almost nostalgia for nostalgia. Serge Morissette was thirteen when he became a Genesis fan. This was in 1973, the year the band released its fifth studio album, <em>Selling England by the Pound</em>. Morissette grew up near Thetford Mines, Quebec, a city of about 26,000, south of the provincial capital. He wasn’t old enough to travel to Quebec City for a Genesis concert until 1977, so he never saw them play with Gabriel. He came to understand the full extent of what he’d missed after moving to Montreal for university in 1979. He was part of a fan club that included people who had been to Old Genesis shows. They shared photos and talked about concerts they had been to, particularly one at the Université de Montréal’s sports centre, known as CEPSUM, in November 1973, when Genesis was touring <em>Selling England</em>. It changed their lives, they said. “What Peter was doing, it was totally credible,” one of them told Morissette. “You believed in the guy.” This fan showed Morissette some Super 8 footage he’d taped of a concert from the same tour as the CEPSUM show. After he saw the film, Morissette wanted to see the show. In person. More than ever.</p>
<p>I said Genesis fans are uniquely nostalgic, but Morissette doesn’t strike me as someone who has spent much time in “if only” land. He’s more of a doer. By 1993, he’d graduated from mechanical engineering at UdeM and was working at the Société de transport de Montréal. He had a side gig at the Spectrum, a beloved (and bygone) venue on Sainte-Catherine Street in Montreal, where he helped out with visual effects and video editing. The owners happened to be fans of Old Genesis. When Morissette proposed a show commemorating the twentieth anniversary of Genesis’s CEPSUM concert, they agreed. </p>
<p>And that was how Morissette met Sébastien Lemothe, a young Montreal bass player who had recently formed a band called the Musical Box (TMB). Unlike the handful of Genesis tribute bands gigging in the city’s club circuit, TMB played Old Genesis music exclusively, with a focus on songs from the <em>Selling England</em> tour. They had a real Mellotron, an analogue precursor to the modern sampler that went out of production in the 1980s, and were as intent on reproducing the exact sound of <em>Selling England</em> as Morissette was on making the show look exactly as it did in 1973: the same lights, the same sets, the same costumes. TMB was “a perfect fit” for his purposes, Morissette says, the only small wrinkles being that it was a seven-piece band (there had been only five musicians on stage at the CEPSUM show) and that the lead singer did not play the flute, as Gabriel had done on the tour. Morissette decided he could live with the discrepancies and invited TMB to be a part of his project. </p>

<p>The show was set to run for three nights. Tickets were $20 a piece, a price that seemed exorbitant for what people understood was a cover band. On the first night, “the venue was empty,” Morissette tells me. (In fact, he remembers, they sold around 200 tickets; the venue’s capacity was about 1,200.) But when the keyboardist played the ominous opening chords of “Watcher of the Skies,” and a caped figure appeared on a darkened stage wearing a batwing fascinator and UV paint around his eyes, the Genesis fan who had filmed the Super 8 footage of the original production stood beside Morissette and cried, “That’s it! That’s it!” A TV crew filmed a live spot, and it ran on the ten o’clock news; the next two nights sold out. TMB took the show to Quebec City, and it sold out there too.</p>
<p>Lemothe wanted to keep going, to keep tweaking the show and bring it as close as possible to the original performances. (Lemothe was not available to be interviewed for this story.) He hired Morissette as a kind of consultant. Soon, TMB was looking for a new singer; the original frontman left the band in 1994. Enter Denis Gagné, who also grew up in Thetford Mines. (Two other current band members grew up there&mdash;drummer Marc Laflamme and François Gagnon, the band’s “Steve Hackett.”) Gagné and Morissette had met years earlier at a lip-synched Genesis tribute show Morissette put on at the local CÉGEP. (Morissette tells me Gagné still has the poster from that show). Gagné auditioned and became the band’s “Peter.”</p>
<p>Gagné had a bar shaved down the middle of his scalp just like the one Gabriel had in the early ’70s. He watched hours of video so as to copy Gabriel’s movements, down to the way he held and hit his tambourine. He memorized Gabriel’s spiels between songs; when performing for French-speaking audiences, he spoke French (his first language) haltingly, just as Gabriel had done. He and Morissette studied photos of the glittery rainbow cape Gabriel wore in “Watcher of the Skies” and spent days trying to determine what it was made of. Was it transparent? How did it react to black lights? When they discovered that the particular fabric was no longer being made, they sought out old swathes from textile warehouses, managing to find it in only five of the seventeen colours included in the original cape. They had to stitch in other “close enough” material. </p>
<p>Over the next five years, TMB expanded its repertoire, adding reproductions of Genesis’s tours of <em>Nursery Cryme</em>, which came out in 1971, and more frequently of <em>Foxtrot</em>. By 1998, the band had built a big following in Quebec and seen some success in Ontario but struggled to find an audience anywhere else. TMB had formed a corporation, which was losing money. The band couldn’t keep paying to play, and they couldn’t play in Montreal and Quebec City forever. They decided to see if they could do the one tour they hadn’t yet tackled: <em>The Lamb</em>. If not, they would call it a day.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he first tribute band</span> I ever saw was a group called Over the Garden Wall, a name taken from the Genesis song “I Know What I Like.” This was in the late ’80s, shortly after I’d moved to Montreal for university. The band played a mix of Old and post-Gabriel Genesis, and the singer wore parts of the costumes for some of the songs. I felt like I was at a party with sixty people who had also experienced a eureka moment in the back seat of their parents’ car. For the band, I felt a kind of awed gratitude. I could not quite fathom they were willing to play make-believe in front of a live audience. </p>
<p>I never sought them out again. I started following contemporary bands, and at some point, I became&mdash;like many people&mdash;dismissive of tributes. A prevailing notion took hold in the 1960s and ’70s that rock music should be original, authentic, written by the performer. Gregory points out that copyright laws have cemented this aesthetic, suggesting that “to perform anything other than one’s own material is symptomatic of creative bankruptcy.”</p>
<p>But the words “original” and “authentic” lie at the heart of TMB’s raison d’être. And to do <em>The Lamb</em> in proper TMB style, the band would have to recreate a slideshow that featured about 1,000 images, many of them staged: a gloved hand shaving a furry white heart with a straight razor, a man cradling a porcupine. The pictures accompanied the songs, but they were more than a complement&mdash;they were another layer of storytelling. There was no footage clear or comprehensive enough to discern each and every frame. TMB needed access to the original slides&mdash;but first, they needed permission to perform <em>The Lamb</em> at all. </p>
<p>Because it essentially qualifies as a musical (story plus music), anyone wanting to recreate <em>The Lamb</em> has to obtain a special licence called “grand rights.” Morissette reached out to Tony Smith, Genesis’s long-time manager, who said Morissette would have to ask Gabriel. He was eventually able to contact Annie Parsons, who worked at Gabriel’s record label, Real World. The answer was no, Parsons told Morissette: Gabriel wanted to adapt <em>The Lamb</em> himself. Morissette called her back. “Mrs. Parsons,” he said, “maybe my request isn’t clear. What we are asking for is permission to recreate <em>The Lamb</em>. Peter won’t recreate it; he will do something else with it. What we are asking for is not in competition in any way.” Morissette could hear the exasperation in Parsons’s voice, but she relented. “‘Send me some video, and I will ask him again,’” he remembers her saying. </p>
<p>About a month later, Morissette received a fax with Gabriel’s response: this time, the answer was yes. It took about two years in all to secure a one-year licence to perform the show. TMB paid to have the slides copied and delivered to Montreal. New costumes and sets were built over several months. Every single festering bubble on the Slipperman getup was reconstructed by hand, using clay and latex. TMB premiered its <em>Lamb</em> production on October 11, 2000, at the Spectrum and played several more shows in Quebec and Ontario over the next nine months. </p>
<p><em>The Lamb</em> was a turning point. TMB had always seen itself as having less in common with a tribute band than, say, an orchestra playing Beethoven; now, Beethoven was taking the orchestra seriously. In 2002, when TMB brought its <em>Selling England</em> show on a seven-stop tour of the UK, the band members met Rutherford and Hackett at a rehearsal space in Chiddingfold, the Surrey village where Genesis’s recording studio, the Farm, is located. Hackett performed an encore with the band at Royal Albert Hall. Morissette visited Banks in his home. Gabriel saw TMB perform in Bristol and told Morissette to have Gagné phone him the next day. Gagné demurred; he was trying to protect his voice for the next show. “Serge looked at me and said, ‘Peter Gabriel is asking you to call him&mdash;you’re saying you’re not going to call him?’” Gagné tells me, speaking English with a slight British accent. He did, of course, speak to his archetype in the end. </p>
<p>In 2003, TMB visited the Farm, where they listened to the original <em>Selling England</em> tapes. They were also able to see the guitars Rutherford used on Genesis’s <em>Selling England</em> and <em>The Lamb </em>tours&mdash;both of them double-neck Rickenbackers, with a twelve-string guitar on one neck&mdash;which TMB had recreated for the left-handed Lemothe. That same year, after a second tour in Europe, TMB broke even for the first time. Since then, they’ve averaged about fifty shows annually, rotating between different productions. By the time I saw them play <em>The Lamb</em> in 2022, they were touring it for the fourth time. After the show, I did the math. Genesis put on just over 100 performances of <em>The Lamb</em>; TMB had played maybe three times that. I wondered if they knew <em>The Lamb</em> better than Genesis ever did. And also if they loved it better.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">o see a TMB</span> show as a fan of Old Genesis is to enter into a contract with the band. The band members will pretend to be Genesis and you will pretend to believe them. And in the course of the two-hour concert, if all goes to plan, there will be at least a few fractions of a second when you aren’t pretending.</p>
<p>At first, I thought this was why TMB mattered&mdash;because of people like me and Jack Beermann, who grew up in Skokie, Illinois. At sixteen, Beermann actually turned down the chance to go to a <em>Lamb</em> show in Chicago in 1975. “Ah, man,” he said to the friend who offered him a ticket. “I’m tired. My parents probably won’t let me go out. Thanks anyway.” After seeing Genesis play a year later&mdash;sans Gabriel&mdash;he went out and bought all the old records. “‘Supper’s Ready’ was the most amazing thing I’d ever heard,” he tells me. He became a super fan, collecting bootlegs, joining fan clubs, and going to see Genesis at least once on each of their subsequent tours. He heard about TMB through a Majordomo email list, and in 1994, he travelled to Montreal from Boston to see the band play at the Spectrum. As soon as the show started, he sat up in his seat. “I wasn’t expecting them to have a real Mellotron,” he says. When TMB performed “Supper’s Ready,” Beermann became emotional. Missing out on Old Genesis was “the biggest regret in my life,” he tells me. Seeing TMB, “I felt like I could rest.”</p>
<p>This is the kind of story I expected to hear. Then I talked to Thomas Manchon, who was born in 1987 and went to see TMB’s <em>Selling England</em> show in Paris in the early 2000s. He didn’t know anything about the costumes or the theatrics. “It was totally new for me,” he says. “It was just like a teenager in the ’70s going to a Genesis show.” It takes me a moment to grasp what this means: in a sense, for Manchon, TMB is Old Genesis. He never had to mourn what he missed: he never missed anything. “The first time I heard ‘Supper’s Ready’ was during a Musical Box show,” he says.  </p>
<p>For the past several years, Manchon has been helping TMB find Old Genesis archival material. In 2021, he sent Morissette some footage from a 1974 <em>Selling England</em> concert in Santa Monica. In the middle of the song “Battle of Epping Forest,” Gabriel took off his hat and threw it on the floor behind Rutherford. Morissette called Gagné and Lemothe immediately; none of them had ever seen Gabriel do this before. “We were yelling like kids,” says Morissette. This hat throw will likely show up in TMB’s refreshed <em>Selling England</em> show, on a tour that begins in November. It will be fifty years since Genesis played at the CEPSUM.</p>
<p>Morissette likens what TMB does to archaeology. I keep wondering whether it can be called art. Ian Benhamou, who joined TMB as keyboardist in 2018, thinks the word “artistic” might apply better; after all, he says, TMB is not creating anything new. But when I ask the band’s drummer, Marc Laflamme, “Is it art?” he is categorical: “It definitely is.” With TMB’s commitment to detail and accuracy, he says, they have invented a new way of paying tribute to Genesis. It’s not that they’re necessarily better than other Genesis tribute bands. It’s that they are the most devoted. </p>
<p>I ask Morissette who or what all his painstaking replication work is for. Is it for Genesis fans? Is it for Genesis? Is it in the name of some larger cause: the preservation of art? “Oh, it’s for me,” he says. He tells me that he started recreating the shows because he never got to see the real ones. But then it dawned on him that when he’s watching live music, he lives in the present. “It means I’m happy,” he says. “I’m living in the moment that is happening. I’m not thinking about the future or the past.”</p>
<p>I ask if he ever has a moment, like I did in <em>The Lamb</em> show, when he feels as though he’s watching the original band. He says that he is especially satisfied when TMB plays “Apocalypse in 9/8”&mdash;the sixth section of “Supper’s Ready,” when Gagné comes out wearing the geometrical headgear, and behind him, a special projector throws flames onto the sets. “For me,” he says, “it’s Genesis.” Does he enter an alternate reality? Does he forget that both he and the band are pretending? I doubt it. But I like to think that, at some point, the fact that Rutherford is holding his double-neck guitar to the right rather than the left blurs into the background. Just for a few fractions of a second. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/second-genesis-when-a-tribute-band-transcends-the-original/">Second Genesis: When a Tribute Band Transcends the Original</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1600" height="1067" src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Isen_TaylorSwiftReporter_cg_1800.jpeg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="A photo illustration of a portfolio filled with newspaper clippings from stories about Taylor Swift." loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="" srcset="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Isen_TaylorSwiftReporter_cg_1800.jpeg 1600w, https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Isen_TaylorSwiftReporter_cg_1800-735x490.jpeg 735w, https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Isen_TaylorSwiftReporter_cg_1800-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Isen_TaylorSwiftReporter_cg_1800-1200x800.jpeg 1200w, https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Isen_TaylorSwiftReporter_cg_1800-348x232.jpeg 348w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n mid-September,</span> Gannett&mdash;the parent company of USA Today Network&mdash;posted two different but analogous writing jobs: a Taylor Swift Reporter and a Beyoncé Knowles-Carter Reporter. Both positions exist to explore each star’s cultural influence, chronicling highlights from their respective world tours to offer readers “an inside view.” Beyond the basic journalism-job credentials, like a bachelor’s degree and a few years of prior experience, the postings also stipulate the candidate’s “willingness to travel extensively”; the preferred “ability to report in more than one language” (they don’t specify which); and, for the aforementioned travel, “a valid driver’s license, reliable transportation, [and] the minimum liability insurance required by state law” (once again, they don’t specify, and the minimums vary). Sure, the rate is potentially decent; the upper end of the listed range puts it at just over $50 (US) an hour. But that rate could also be closer to $20. Nobody seems quite sure.</p>
<p>The lack of pay transparency and the punitive requirements didn’t stop fans from swooning over these jobs&mdash;as, perhaps, Gannett had known they wouldn’t, having chosen stars beloved enough to insulate the company from the harshest critiques. The <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/taylor-swift-beyonce-reporter-applications-a2c827c0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a></em> estimated that, by the end of September, the hiring team had received about 1,000 résumés for the two gigs combined. (Anecdotally, 500 applications for a single media job is, in this climate, not necessarily the flex they might think it is.) Fellow publications were also relatively uncritical, including <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/12/newspaper-is-hiring-taylor-swift-reporter.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CNBC</a>, which fizzed that “one lucky journalist [would] be paid to keep tabs” on Swift, a gig the <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/sep/12/taylor-swift-reporter-job-posting-gannett" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Guardian</a></em> touted as a “Taylor Swift fan’s wildest dream” (a riff on one of her song titles). Sure. But journalists have dreams too, and as a more critical strain of responses made clear, this type of gig isn’t it. Gannett, whose chief content officer ambitiously told the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> that these jobs would “save local journalism,” had previously cut back its local news coverage and laid off about 6 percent of its American media division. On social media, writers were quick to point out the contradiction when the job was announced. One deadpan reply read, “Is there a climate change reporter? Just checking.”</p>

</ul>
<p>While the Taylor Swift and Beyoncé beats might share some superficial crossovers with the objectives of local journalism&mdash;each one appeals to a specific community and addresses the issues that are most important to them&mdash;the similarities stop there. Hyper-specific coverage of a single artist is more about generating clicks and revenue than providing meaningful access to information about issues where there’s legitimate public interest in on-the-ground reporting. Taken that way, these jobs are less the saviour of local journalism and more its bespoke Grim Reaper. </p>
<p>Writers and news publications face mounting challenges to reach their readerships. On the creaky platform formerly known as Twitter, writers have observed a general decline in engagement when they share their work, or really anything at all&mdash;even if they have spent years building up a sizable following. <a href="https://www.damemagazine.com/2023/09/12/when-twitter-died-so-did-independent-journalism/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">In a piece for <em>Dame</em> magazine</a> on the intertwined deaths of Twitter and independent journalism, Andrea Grimes wrote that, following Elon Musk’s takeover of the platform, she was “struggling to reach more than a few dozen people at a time” while covering a Texas impeachment trial. Attempts to migrate one’s audience to a different site, like Substack, were obstructed wholesale when Musk temporarily prevented linking to newsletters in tweets and vice versa. </p>
<p>In Canada, the struggle of bringing news to readers comes with an additional twist: in August, Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, began blocking both domestic and international news links from being viewed by Canadian users. This was in response to Bill C-18, which sought compensation for tech giants’ dissemination of journalistic content. Local news in Canada isn’t having an easy time either. Though there are some independent and small-scale outlets that still manage to survive, the funding behind that kind of work remains perilous. Last month, Metroland Media Group ended the print editions of a number of community newspapers and laid off 60 percent of its workforce, to the tune of about 600 jobs. It turns the stomach to imagine the company suggesting, much like Gannett did, that the logical next step after such a colossal affront would be to hire a fan who can turn a nice phrase to cover the Drake beat.</p>
<p>Choosing which subjects to cover always requires a negotiation between the stories readers hunger for and the ones where journalists decide, for various reasons, that there ought to be an appetite. Publishing pieces about a celebrity’s world tour is certainly part of that calculus. But dedicating so many resources to this kind of coverage shifts the balance in a way that risks abandoning the original audience and its needs altogether. It also calls into question the future of writers’ journalistic beats. The erosion of various social media platforms makes it harder than ever for writers to carve out an identity and a calling card tied to the subjects they cover. The suggestion that the best way to get eyes on your work, or to get work at all, is to reduce your output to only the most trending topics is to take a superficial part of the job and make it the point.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m leery of all this because it’s happened to me. I saw years of my work reduced to a headline about Taylor Swift. The situation was a little different from being paid $50 an hour to cover her life: in a review of my 2022 essay collection, <em>Some of My Best Friends</em>&mdash;in <em>USA Today</em>, no less&mdash;Swift was elevated from her status as a cursory mention (in an essay that offers a wide-angle analysis of white femininity) to the implicit thesis of my entire book. “Tajja Isen calls out Taylor Swift’s political ‘lip service,’ white fragility,” read the title of <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2022/04/22/some-my-best-friends-tajja-isen-social-justice-cultural-essays/7399654001/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the review</a>. Maybe putting her name in the headline made lots of people click on the link, as was presumably intended, though I’m not sure being pitted against a behemoth of a pop star did me or the book any favours. In any case, flattening an argument into the clickbait of Swift’s name is nothing new. Now imagine opening your newspaper&mdash;you still do that, right?&mdash;to see that, somehow, no matter the tenuousness of the connection, Taylor Swift’s name has been shoehorned into the title of the day’s major story.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/taylor-swift-reporter/">Do We Really Need a Taylor Swift Reporter?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>When the wave of reckonings triggered by #MeToo hit the literary world, we became curious about how CanLit, an institution stocked with provocative personalities, would fare. Which major Canadian book would suddenly become difficult to defend post Weinstein? What sprung most readily to mind was Leonard Cohen’s </em>Beautiful Losers<em>, a novel with the distinction of being intersectionally problematic (it’s racist </em>and<em> sexist). The book is particularly canonical in classrooms because its publication is seen as signalling the arrival of postmodernism in Canada, but it is also increasingly disturbing to teach because of its politics. Myra Bloom signed up for the mission of re-evaluating the novel and Cohen’s mystique as a self-styled ladies’ man more generally. The essay, originally published in April 2018, was especially well timed given the hagiolatry that intensified after Cohen’s death, but Bloom’s nuanced insights into the limits of artistic veneration are just as fresh and valuable today. &mdash;Carmine Starnino, interim editor-in-chief, November 2023 issue</em></p>
<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smallcaps">n November 10, 2016,</span> the night Leonard Cohen’s death was announced, pilgrims began assembling at the doorstep of Cohen’s Montreal home to cry, pray, and lay offerings. This was just the beginning. Over the next year, the multitudes would gather to worship at Montreal’s ever more prodigious altars: two enormous murals, one of them twenty storeys high; a star-studded tribute concert; a blockbuster exhibit at Montreal’s Musée d’art contemporain. Today, it’s clear that a full-blown canonization has taken place: as a recent <em>New York Times</em> article perceptively noted, Cohen has become the “New Secular Saint of Montreal.”</p>
<p>The description is not hyperbole or metaphor but an accurate assessment of Cohen’s immaculate status in the current zeitgeist. The former enfant terrible of Canadian arts and letters&mdash;erstwhile refuser of Governor General’s Awards, ingestor of drugs on Greek islands, recipient of head on unmade beds&mdash;has transmogrified, through death, into a holy figure. The posthumous hagiography attests to the power of Cohen’s religious imagery, which arguably reached its peak in his final album, <em>You Want It Darker</em>. The haunting title track, featuring backing vocals by the Shaar Hashomayim Synagogue Choir, makes you feel like Cohen is in direct communion with God as he proclaims, in the Biblical tongue of his ancestors, “Hineni, hineni / I’m ready, my Lord.” Add to this the massive success of “Hallelujah”&mdash;ignored when first released in the ’80s, resurrected by Jeff Buckley, Rufus Wainwright, and k.&thinsp;d. lang, and currently in contention for the most overperformed song in history&mdash;and you’ve got yourself a prophet.</p>

</ul>
<p>Such is the aura of sacredness that attaches to the High Priest of Pathos that dissident views are treated as heresy. Writer and critic Anakana Schofield said it best in an essay published a month before Cohen’s death: “Be very careful challenging opinion on Leonard Cohen, it’s like bringing up someone’s ex-partner with a mistaken warm smile on your face.” Full disclosure: as the child of two Montreal-raised Jews (one of whom is, incidentally, a Leonard), I’ve been steeped in Cohen’s music/legend since I was a zygote, and my love for him abides. Still, I think it worth considering how the posthumous focus on the “later” Cohen&mdash;whose grandfatherly, fedora-clad image towers benevolently (in duplicate!) over Montreal&mdash;obscures a more complex understanding of a man who, before he became divine, was obsessed with the flesh, and not always in ways that are palatable today.</p>
<p>Given that our threshold for bad male behaviour is currently sitting at an all-time low, we can surmise that Cohen’s “ladies’ man” persona&mdash;cultivated in an era when the term still connoted “romantic artist” rather than “pickup artist”&mdash;would get less traction now. By his own admission, Cohen was never “very good” at relationships: “I had a great appetite for the company of women,” he said in a 2005 interview. “[But] I wasn’t very good at the things that a woman wanted” (read: fidelity). In his work, women are often depicted as muses&mdash;quasi-mystical figures who inspire the poet’s imagination and then conveniently disappear (cf. songs such as “Hallelujah,” “Suzanne,” “So Long, Marianne,” “Hey, That’s No Way to Say Goodbye”&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;). On the first page of his 1994 biography, <em>Leonard Cohen: A Life in Art</em>, Ira Nadel notes approvingly: “when entrapped by beauty, [Cohen] finds his art imperiled. He responds by seeking freedom, recognizing the need to dismantle love&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;for only art can truly seduce Leonard Cohen.”</p>
<p>This is a classic example of what historian Martin Jay calls the “aesthetic alibi” men have been using since the nineteenth century to justify bad behaviour. Today, the myth of the male genius has come under fire in the wake of movements such as #MeToo and Time’s Up, which have established the role of such tropes in legitimating the abusive treatment of women. This isn’t to suggest that Cohen’s dalliances were always so well received back in his heyday; just before <em>Death of a Ladies’ Man</em> (1978) was published, <em>Chatelaine</em> ran a piece called “Death of a Ladies’ Chauvinist,” which wondered whether the book would be a “rejection of his former womanizing self.” One would think that we would be hearing more of this criticism applied retroactively. For some reason, though, Cohen’s womanizing seems to have been grandfathered in. A commemorative 2016 CBC Music profile gushed, “What woman wouldn’t be flattered to be the focus of such a fiercely artistic, intellectual, romantic man?”</p>
<p>In terms of the objectification of women, Cohen’s songs (even the cringe-inducing, though admittedly rollicking, “Don’t Go Home with Your Hard-On”) are nowhere near as extreme as his fiction. This fact has not gone unremarked by the generation of undergraduates currently grappling with his two published novels, <em>The Favourite Game</em> (1963) and <em>Beautiful Losers</em> (1966). The latter, in particular, has long been a staple of CanLit syllabi; its experimental form, along with its critique of history, religion, and other metanarratives, makes it a perfect object lesson in Canadian postmodernism. Lately, though, the book has started to resemble a how-to guide for writers who want to tank their literary careers. Indigenous appropriation? Check. Misogyny and graphic sexual violence? Check.</p>
<p><em>Beautiful Losers</eM> has always shocked readers. <em>Toronto Star</em> critic Robert Fulford famously called it “the most revolting book ever written in Canada” (though, to be fair, he also called it “the most interesting Canadian book of the year”). But where cultural artifacts that are shocking in their own era tend to become less so over time, <em>Beautiful Losers</em> is one of those rare books that is more outrageous now than when it was first published. The narrator (unnamed, though I’ll follow Cohen scholars in referring to him as “I”) is “a well-known folklorist, an authority” on an Indigenous tribe he refers to throughout the novel as “the A&mdash; &mdash;s.” Today, this premise alone would be enough to warrant a terse rejection letter from potential publishers.</p>
<p>It gets worse: when the book opens, I’s wife, an A&mdash; &mdash; woman named Edith, has just died by suicide in a baroque manner involving an elevator shaft. This is but one of the many abuses Edith will endure over the course of <em>Beautiful Losers</em>, in which she will also be raped twice, first by a gang of men and then by a possessed vibrator. The narrator recounts these events with gleeful precision and essentially spends the rest of the book “touching her perfect body with his mind.” The novel’s other Indigenous character does not fare much better. I’s erotic attention falls equally on Catherine Tekakwitha, a seventeenth-century Mohawk woman who converted to Christianity and later became a saint: “I fell in love with a religious picture of you,” he announces; “You were standing among birch trees.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;God knows how far up your moccasins were laced.” Said moccasins are removed in a later scene where a lecherous priest molests her feet&mdash;recounted with a stomach-churning “Gobble-gobblegogglewoggle. Slurp.”</p>
<p>It is not surprising, given the above (to say nothing of the ubiquitous masturbation or the fact that the novel’s middle section is penned with “one hand on a letter and one hand up a juicy cunt”), that <em>Beautiful Losers</em> has been going through a bit of an identity crisis of late. In the ’70s, the famous academic Linda Hutcheon named it “the most challenging and perceptive novel about Canada and her people yet written.” In contrast, Schofield recently called it “a failed, fossilized encounter” and “prayed privately that no indigenous woman would ever have to suffer reading [it].” The book’s status in the CanLit canon, formerly unquestioned, also seems less secure these days. One literature professor I polled said he doesn’t teach the book anymore because “there are too many issues to navigate in it.” Another decided to put a trigger warning on his syllabus, cautioning “[s]tudents who ‘love Leonard Cohen’ when they enter the course” that they might be “shocked to find some of his works ethically repellent.” This proved true: a lot of his students, he told me, were indeed deeply offended, particularly by the treatment of Edith.</p>
<p>While such reactions are fully understandable, it is worth looking a little closer at what Cohen was trying to do in <em>Beautiful Losers</em>. We can glean enough from Cohen’s life and writing, including the novel, to know that he did not endorse violence against women in general or Indigenous women in particular. You could even go as far as to say that he was ahead of his time in acknowledging Canada’s colonial history before this issue really entered mainstream consciousness. The book about Catherine Tekakwitha that apparently inspired the novel was in fact lent to him by Abenaki filmmaker <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/at-ninety-one-alanis-obomsawin-is-not-ready-to-put-down-her-camera/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alanis Obomsawin</a>, a friend of his; according to scholar Randolph Lewis, many elements of Edith’s character, including the abuse, are linked to Obomsawin. Lewis argues, echoing a common interpretation, that “Cohen imagines the Native female body as a symbol of political conquest in his surreal allegory of intercultural violence.” In other words, Cohen is being ironic. You can see it in I’s use of a nationalistic explanation to explain Edith’s rape: “French Canadian schoolbooks do not encourage respect for the Indians. Some part of the Canadian Catholic mind is not certain of the Church’s victory over the Medicine Man.”</p>
<p>By current yardsticks, though, it doesn’t really matter whether Cohen was being ironic, because we have collectively rejected irony as a means of addressing systemic injustice. In the ’90s, David Foster Wallace criticized irony as “singularly unuseful when it comes to constructing anything to replace the hypocrisies it debunks.” Today, we’ve taken the critique a step further, recognizing irony’s power to uphold the very structures of power it ostensibly denounces. This is particularly true when there is a power difference between the speaker and their subject. Consider the backlash against Kenneth Goldsmith or Vanessa Place, two avant-garde white artists whose purportedly anti-racist work got them accused of, well, racism. Or, closer to home, Hal Niedzviecki’s infamous call for an “appropriation prize” for writers. If such a prize really existed, <em>Beautiful Losers</em> would probably win.</p>
<p>For these reasons, <em>Beautiful Losers</em> will likely continue its slide into the dustbin of history and, with it, our memory of the young author who wrote it, high off his face on amphetamines and sunstroke on the Greek island of Hydra. Instead, we will continue basking in the light of the elder Cohen’s towering icon while listening to saccharine covers of “Hallelujah” on repeat. And this will be a loss, for <em>Beautiful Losers</em> is an important reminder that before Cohen became a saint, he was just a flawed man. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-darker-side-of-leonard-cohen/">The Darker Side of Leonard Cohen</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

They’re being trained on our pirated books, say the writers, and they don’t chew their food. How can they, since they’re being force-fed every last bit of verbiage their proprietors can filch? Will they just gobble us up like great white sharks, burping out an endless stream of teeth, bones, and ersatz fictions claiming to be by us?  Will they infiltrate themselves into us like the emotionless pod people in <em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em> and eat us from the inside out, transforming us into fakes of ourselves and giving pink flowers a bad name? </p>
<p>Are they malevolent aliens, or are they more like human criminals? They certainly can’t be depended on to tell the truth, except maybe about things like airline schedules. But can they write convincing Harlequin Romance novels? Will the real Harlequin Romance writers be done out of their jobs? </p>
<p>AI chatbots cannot dress up in period costume. Or not yet. There’s that. </p>

</ul>
<p>Will they write political speeches? That’s more than likely. Some of them are already hard at it. But will they ever be able to come up with new catchphrases, such as “I did nothing wrong” and “I alone can fix it”? Oh. Sorry. Not so new. </p>
<p>Take heart! Not all is gloom! So far, generative AI chatbots don’t seem able to reflect on what they’re saying, though that in itself wouldn’t differentiate them from some actual human beings. Also, they’re bad at verbal texture, and they have a poor grasp of metaphor and sometimes even of punctuation. Well, they’re learning from us, so why wouldn’t that be true?</p>
<p>You’re still worried, young author? You doubt my word? Here are a couple of recent literary attempts by AI chatbots that ought to reassure you. </p>
<p>The first is a poem, requested by one of the board members of the Pelee Island Bird Observatory&mdash;PIBO&mdash;which counts and evaluates the health of migratory species on an island in Lake Erie. The bird banders and volunteers often have to wade through knee-deep mud and contend with chiggers, mosquitoes, and biting flies. They don’t wear gloves&mdash;they need a fine and gentle touch to handle small birds&mdash;or insect repellant, as that could be toxic. Let’s just say they suffer so that you can continue to enjoy birdsong.</p>
<p>Here is the request made to the chatbot, followed by the result:</p>
<p>“Give me a poem using PIBO and the important work it does as the subject.” It took ten seconds. “And now&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;including mosquitoes, chiggers, stable flies and mud”:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4.5em;">
Upon Pelee Island, where the migrators roam,<br />
There exists a sanctuary, a cherished home.<br />
PIBO stands strong, in this nature’s canvas,<br />
Guarding avian secrets, amidst the wilderness vast. </p>
<p>Dawn lights up the skies, warblers sing their tune,<br />
While mosquitoes buzz and chiggers commune.<br />
Stable flies flutter, adding to the whirl,<br />
In this muddy haven, life’s mysteries unfurl. </p>
<p>With gentle hands, they band and observe,<br />
Each bird, each flight path, each graceful curve.<br />
Their research, a beacon through the migration night,<br />
Guiding safely, each feathered flight.</p>
<p>Tales of epic journeys, of tempests braved,<br />
By our avian kin, by PIBO saved.<br />
And amidst the insects’ dance and the fertile mud,<br />
Echoes the rhythm of life’s ceaseless flood.</p>
<p>Through the digital window, the world looks on,<br />
As PIBO’s mission is daily drawn.<br />
From this mud-rich base, to lands afar,<br />
Spread the lessons of life, each under a star.</p>
<p>Thus stands PIBO, on Pelee’s serene coast,<br />
A sentinel of the skies, humanity’s boast.<br />
Among mosquitoes, chiggers, and stable flies’ hum,<br />
Sings the profound mission, of the noble PIBO’s drum.</p></div>
<p>You see what I mean about the punctuation? I might note as well that Pelee Island is not exactly a “wilderness vast”—see map, a thing the chatbot evidently did not do—and that the idea of chiggers communing in your armpits, though whimsical, is not observant of their social habits, which are nul. Nor do stable flies flutter, unless by happy chance you’ve smacked one of them and it’s not dead yet. </p>
<p>Yes, I know. You’ll say that these are minor quibbles, and your Uncle Roger writes doggerel verse like this by the yard and sends it out to you every Christmas. I point out that a chatbot replacing Uncle Roger might very well happen, but, dear published author, it is not yet very likely to replace you.</p>
<p>My second demonstration piece was instigated by The Walrus. Here is the ask, followed by the response:</p>
<p>Prompt: Can you write a dark and dystopian short story in the voice of Margaret Atwood that takes place in Canada?</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4.5em;"><strong>The Weeping Willows of Winnipeg</strong></p>
<p>Every morning, as the rose-tinted dawn slices the stillness of night, I see the Weeping Willows of Winnipeg. They stand tall yet humbled, their drooping branches laden with the invisible weight of despair. The people here, they too carry an unseen burden. Their weary faces are etched with deep lines, their eyes holding echoes of stories they’re too afraid to tell.</p>
<p>Winnipeg, once a thriving city, is now a desolate ghost town, crippled by the icy grip of the Northern Wastes that have extended their deadly reach. The permafrost that used to recede with the summer sun, now remains a permanent fixture, a chilling symbol of the loss we have borne.</p>
<p>The world changed after the Last Oil Crisis. Our dependence on fossil fuels had been our downfall. Nature, which we had exploited for centuries, took its revenge. Global warming accelerated, the Arctic ice caps melted and the Jet Stream collapsed, plunging Canada into a never-ending winter.</p>
<p>People adapted as best they could. We learned to survive in constant sub-zero temperatures, to huddle together for warmth, to forage for whatever we could eat. We learned to fear the silence, the vast, white stillness that swallowed the sounds of life. We learned to mourn the loss of the sun, the loss of hope.</p>
<p>The government, which we thought was a sturdy lighthouse guiding us through tumultuous waves, collapsed under the weight of its lies and deceit. Anarchy ensued. Gangs roamed the icy streets of Winnipeg, their eyes hollow, hearts even more so. Survival was the only law that mattered now.</p>
<p>I remember the days of warmth, the days of green trees, and blooming flowers. I remember the bubbling laughter of children, the bustling city streets, and the sweet scent of the bakery near our old house. Now, all that remains is the biting chill, the gnawing hunger, and the pervasive fear.</p>
<p>But the Weeping Willows, they keep me going. These ancient trees, they are the last vestige of the world that was. Their slender, weeping branches whisper tales of past springs and hopeful summers. They symbolize resilience, endurance. They are a beacon of hope in a world dominated by despair.</p>
<p>In their quiet lament, I hear a promise. A promise that nature will endure, that it will bounce back, reclaim its rightful place. Every morning, as I watch the dawn illuminate their snow-laden branches, I see a spark of life, a glimpse of the world that once was, and could be again.</p>
<p>The Weeping Willows of Winnipeg stand tall, not in defiance, but in acceptance of the harsh reality, and yet with a quiet assurance of a spring that may return. We must weather this winter of our discontent, like the willows, bending but never breaking. After all, hope is a stubborn thing; it survives even in the darkest of times, it thrives in the coldest of hearts.</p></div>
<p>When you return from the bathroom, having recovered from your bout of faux norovirus, give yourself a pat on the back. You, dear author, would never write anything so gawd-awful, and neither&mdash;unless my brain leaves for another planet&mdash;would I. Of course, some of you will make waggish jokes, such as “Sounds like Margaret Atwood to me,” and yes, maybe the bot is onto something with the weary-faced Winnipeggers and their secret stories of terror, no doubt concerning Pierre Poilievre.</p>
<p>But apart from that, gimme a break! If it’s a desolate, perma-frosted ghost town, why haven’t those folks just, you know, moved? And it got cold, but the sun is no longer shining? Really? </p>
<p>As for the weird title, the bot was evidently fed my alliterative children’s stories, such as <em>Princess Prunella and the Purple Peanut</em>. It mixes modes, and cannot seem to distinguish between kid’s lit and the grown-up stuff. Ask it to write a children’s story by Anaïs Nin and see what you get. </p>
<p>So sleep well tonight, dear authors. Your vocation is safe from the pod people. At least for now.</p>
<p><em>The fee for this article has been donated to PIBO, in honour of the partying chiggers and the fluttering stable flies that plague the bird banders. It will buy them some coffee. Since they get up at 5 a.m. to wade through the mud, they always need it. </em></p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/margaret-atwood-ai/">Margaret Atwood Reviews a “Margaret Atwood” Story by AI</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">o get to</span> Emma Lake, follow the number 2 north out of Prince Albert for thirty minutes before pulling a hard left onto the 263. It’s a stunning drive through super-flat Saskatchewan, a dramatic voyage through the abstract quilt work of wheat and canola fields until you pass the unmistakable threshold into Canada’s boreal forest. Ten more minutes through cabin country and Emma Lake is waiting among the poplar woods and mosquito-infested muskeg on the other side.</p>
<p>The lake itself stretches north in three parts. The northernmost section, “Big Emma,” is tranquil thanks to a lack of development, while the southern and central portions offer campgrounds and summer cabins. The waters are filled with pike, walleye, and white sucker, and visitors may see beavers swimming around Cattle Island or black bears foraging at dumpsters. On clear summer nights, the sky can show crackling waves of green and orange. It’s here that, beginning in 1955, painters Kenneth Lochhead and Arthur McKay first coordinated the Emma Lake Artists’ Workshops, where artists would gather and share and create. Or at least they used to, in the old days. </p>
<p>Every August, the organizers invited guest artists from New York or some other faraway place for a weeks-long intensive where the outsiders were tasked with mentoring a dozen or two of their peers. And as artists made the pilgrimage summer after summer, the results would come to define prairie art in the twentieth century.</p>

<p>Emma Lake received a modest budget from the University of Saskatchewan and the province’s arts board in 1955, but the mandate was to invite working artists, not students. And Emma offered nothing of a typical education. There was no structure or oversight for the studio from one mentor to the next. In fact, the mentors were under no obligation to do anything at all. When researcher John King interviewed McKay for an oral history of the Emma Lake Artists’ Workshops&mdash;which offers one of the only comprehensive accounts of the early years&mdash;and asked why they started the program, McKay answered that they felt Saskatchewan “was a highly under-stimulated area; like, nothing was happening. It was far away from everywhere. We didn’t see any original things and the University provided very few grants for travel&mdash;so the only answer was to bring people here.”

<p>Among the guest mentors were some of the most radical&mdash;and polarizing&mdash;figures in modern art, including Clement Greenberg and Barnett Newman. They inspired locals to consider new techniques, new styles. Some artists took to the challenge, while others bristled at the presumption of an outsider deciding how they should approach their work. According to some critics, these outsider voices even remade the region’s style in their own image. The debate continues, but many can agree that for the nearly six decades it survived, Emma Lake succeeded in creating as much conflict as history.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">E</span><span class="smallcaps">mma lake</span> was always the wild younger sister to its sibling in the mountains, Alberta’s <a href="https://www.banffcentre.ca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity</a>. By 1955, the Banff Centre had already been active for twenty-two years and was establishing itself through a mix of theatre, music, and studio arts programming. Unlike the rock-solid infrastructure that developed at Banff, with its enviable library, acoustic performance hall, civilized dining room, and fitness centre, Emma Lake was forever ad hoc, falling apart, and at risk of being cancelled. Banff supports artists; Emma Lake, with its uninhibited water energy, seemed to test them. “The terrible little cottages were most uncomfortable and gloomy and damp,” said painter Robert Bruce, who attended in 1959, according to King’s oral history. “And when we got to the studio, it was raining and the roof leaked. We had a symphony going with all the tin cans and bottles collecting drips.” </p>
<p>But what Emma had was talent. The watershed year was 1959, when New York abstract painter Barnett Newman was invited and his avant-garde ideas immediately began working their way into Saskatchewan’s artistic identity. </p>
<p>Newman was gaining critical favour for the meditative paintings of vertical stripes that he’d been making since 1948&mdash;he called them “zips”&mdash;which he used to explore our experience of colour. It was an approach to abstraction and picture making that was perfect for Saskatchewan and its swaths of yellow wheatfields, green grasslands, and never-ending blue skies.

<p>But when the organizers invited Newman, they had no idea what effect his visit would have on local art. “We had read an article by Eugene Goosen [<em>sic</em>] in the <em>Art News</em> of Barnett Newman’s having a show,” McKay explained to King. “We read the article and thought: Why not?&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;Up to this time, we knew nothing about Newman, so our choices were based on intuition in those days. It was a time when intuition still had free play; in institutions, intuition doesn’t have free play.”</p>
<p>“[Newman] seemed to unlock the potential within us; we were ripe for it,” said painter Ted Godwin. Roy Kiyooka also attended Emma Lake that year, and it came about at a pivotal moment in his development. “I don’t know whether Barney helped to unlock the potential within us,” Kiyooka said chiastically, “but I do know that he helped us to unlock that potential within us.”</p>
<p>Still, art is a messy process. “If the Newman was a ‘peak,’ then I’d sure hate to be there at the bottom,” Robert Bruce told King. He wasn’t won over by the mentor. “As far as I was concerned, [Newman] contributed absolutely nothing artistically.”

<p>But the before-and-after is clear. It was even on display during <em><a href="https://mackenzie.art/exhibition/ten-artists/#:~:text=In%201955%2C%20the%20newly%20established,fertile%20but%20under%2Dexamined%20period." rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ten Artists of Saskatchewan: 1955 Revisited</a></em>, a recent exhibition at the MacKenzie Art Gallery in Regina. Curator Timothy Long restaged an original 1955 exhibition that served as a survey of Saskatchewan’s leading settler artists during its jubilee year in Confederation. As a vision of art before Emma Lake, it’s enlightening.</p>
<p>Both Lochhead and McKay are featured. Rather than the abstraction they later became known for, their paintings here veer toward surrealism and impressionistic styles. Reta Cowley’s paintings from 1955 are also present: edgier, more urban, and more pictorial than her later landscapes, which have a luminous abstract quality to them. Like Cowley, one of her art teachers, Dorothy Knowles has become widely recognized for her prairie landscapes. Born in Unity in 1927, she died this past May, at ninety-six, after an impressive career exploring light and colour in prairie nature. In <em>1955 Revisited</em>, we see one of her earliest pieces and can compare it to her mature work.</p>
<p><em>Roses</em> is a laboured and self-conscious still life of a ceramic vase of fresh flowers set indoors; it lacks not only the spontaneity of her outdoor pictures after Emma Lake but also her later compositional rigour. Knowles would later come to define the Saskatchewan landscape just as one might see that Georgia O’Keeffe captured something essential about New Mexico or how Claude Monet made the Seine his own. But we don’t see that in the 1955 show. We see familiar names but not the kind of picture that would be integral to Saskatchewan’s art identity. To understand the leap, all roads lead back to Emma Lake.

<div class="main_housing" style="max-width: 728px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he most pivotal</span> moment of the workshops was the arrival of Clement Greenberg. A bold and controversial New York art critic still famous for his 1939 essay “Avant-Garde and Kitsch,” and in part responsible for Jackson Pollock’s status in American art, Greenberg actively supported artists who shared his ideas about paintings&mdash;those who sought in picture making what he called “the ineluctable flatness of the surface.” No illusions. His preferred style was nothing like the emerging postmodernism or early strains of pop art of the time but a much more formal approach that he saw as the rightful heir to the modernist avant-garde and “an authentically new episode in the evolution of contemporary art.”</p>
<p>He rewarded those who felt the same. He chose some of his acolytes in his survey of prairie artists for <em><a href="https://canadianart.ca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Canadian Art</a></em> magazine in 1963. More importantly, he picked works by both McKay and Lochhead as well as by two Emma Lake mentors, the American painters Kenneth Noland and Jules Olitski, for his exhibition first held at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, in which he sought to define the generation after Pollock with the title <em>Post Painterly Abstraction</em>. </p>
<p>John Coplans’s review in <em>Artforum</em> sums up the exhibition: “Abstract Expressionism was loose; the new style is tight. Abstract Expressionism revealed brushstrokes; the new style conceals them. Abstract Expressionism used thick paint; the new style uses thin paint. Abstract Expressionism was dense and compact; the new style is clear and open. Abstract Expressionism used accents of dark and light; the new style employs color.” </p>

<p>This style became associated with the “colour field movement,” or “hard-edge abstraction,” and it came to dominate in Saskatchewan. For decades, critics, curators, collectors, and artists associated Greenberg’s visit with the province’s enduring identification with the style, which stuck around in certain areas even after it had long gone out of fashion elsewhere. From the <em>1955 Revisited</em> show, Knowles, Cowley, McKay, and Lochhead, among others, would be associated with this movement. We see, for example, McKay’s practice develop from an impressionistic big-sky, little-town landscape in <em>1955 Revisited</em> to variations on Greenberg’s flatness with minimalist paintings like <em>Circle</em> and <em>Enigma</em>, both selected for the <em>Post Painterly Abstraction</em> show in 1964. </p>
<p>“You have no idea of how much I’m betting on Saskatchewan as N.Y.’s only competitor,” Greenberg wrote to Lochhead in 1963. High praise, but Greenberg lost his shirt, we must admit.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he prairie art scene</span> is contrarian and skeptical through and through, and no acclaim goes without some side-eye. Ronald Bloore, a remarkably fluent abstract artist, noted in a 1964 <em>Canadian Art</em> article that the workshops “poisoned the integrity” of the local artists and that Emma Lake “grew, achieved maturity, faltered and finally substituted for creative exploration an imported, critically secure painting theory.”</p>
<p>The writer Robert Enright noted in a 1984 issue of <em>Canadian Art</em> that “to understand how modernism established its grip&mdash;some would say stranglehold&mdash;on the collective imagination of Saskatoon’s artists, one has only to study the history of the Emma Lake Workshop.”</p>
<p>Imported or invited, stranglehold or inspiration, Greenberg’s visit still ripples. But I would argue that he was never more of an influence than the workshops themselves. The place, the sheer incredibleness of the location, and the workshops’ focus on process and dialogue and relationships&mdash;that is the primary influence on how art developed there through the century. </p>
<p>Artists need a place to explore and experiment, one that tests them in unexpected ways. Emma Lake provided that. Maybe the best example of this occurred in 1965, when one of the most influential process artists came all the way to Emma Lake only to embark upon a complete comedy of errors. Everything went wrong, and it was perfect.</p>
<p>The organizers decided to invite John Cage. His process often produces no clear product. He’s very relational. In 1952, he staged a nonconcert that some consider the first “happening,” a performance event where indeterminate elements just “happen.” His most famous piece of music is “4′33″,” four minutes and thirty-three seconds of a musician sitting at a piano playing nothing: silence. What did he accomplish as a mentor at Emma Lake?</p>
<p>Cage, whose transcendental experiences with nature often occurred when going off into the forests of New York with a wicker basket, collecting boletes and morels, apparently could not conceive of the scale of the wilderness around Emma and “got lost in the muskeg,” as Godwin put it, after he went out alone on just such a mushroom forage. “Yelling, startled moose,” Cage wrote of the experience. “8:00 darkness, soaked sneakers; settled for the night on squirrels’ midden.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;Rationed cigarettes (one every three hours: they’d last ’till noon) Thought about direction (no stars).” He wandered until a search party found him the next day.</p>
<p>The disasters kept piling up. There was a forest fire nearby. McKay fell ill and had to hand over administration to another artist. Knowles got sick and left after a few days. And the cook was terrible and “up-tight.” Sculptor participant Ricardo Gómez described to King how “the atmosphere was tremendously electric. In a way, it was beautiful that it sort of culminated in that fantastic mind-snapping event where everything&mdash;it was just fantastic. Every conceivable thing that could possibly go haywire with anything, did.” Ironically, many who participated seemed to think the two weeks with Cage were inspiring, even if they appeared to have no immediate impact on the local psyche.</p>
<p>Chance, randomness, and uncertainty were all essential to Cage’s process. They also define the history and future of Emma Lake. After a few decades of sporadic programming, the Emma Lake Artists’ Workshops have been indefinitely closed since 2012, suffering from a lack of funding. There have been efforts to revive the program, though no resurrection has yet occurred. </p>
<p>According to <em>Abstract Painting in Canada</em>, Greenberg once said to Godwin: “The history of Canada is written in the landscape.” Greenberg was not wrong. But the history of the land is on another scale entirely and far more enduring than the history of a nation-state. And an artist is only ever beholden to the long history of the universe. </p>
<p>The only mandate Emma Lake ever required of its participants was time alone together in the sanctuary of this awe-inspiring landscape. They just needed to bring themselves fully. Six decades of the Emma Lake Artists’ Workshops granted Saskatchewan a dynamic, unpredictable relationship to contemporary art, and we are all worse off for their absence.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-legacy-of-saskatchewans-most-controversial-and-impactful-artist-program/">The Legacy of Saskatchewan’s Most Controversial—and Impactful—Artist Program</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

While it seemingly represents a breach of academic integrity, it is technically legal in Canada&mdash;and data suggests it’s become prevalent across post-secondary institutions. According to academic ghostwriters like Ross, their work is fair game in a world where post-secondary institutions are failing their students with false promises of prestige following the completion of their degrees. “Colleges are basically businesses,” he says. “People look at what we do as a ‘no-no’ in a moral sense, but they don’t really question the ethics of what the school system is doing to a lot of the students, making these promises to them.” Amid reports of growing financial pressures and mental health challenges, these services have become a lifeline for some, says Ross. A line on his website echoes this sentiment: “You shouldn’t be spending your best years stressed out over assignments that have nothing to do with your career goals.”</p>
<p>Ross’s business, however, is facing a threat: artificial intelligence. Since ChatGPT launched last year, the popular chatbot has opened up a convenient new pathway for students who need to submit essays, while bringing the issue of cheating into sharper focus for schools. For decades, custom essay-writing services have gone largely unchallenged&mdash;but could ChatGPT and tougher anti-cheating measures finally put them in peril?</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="smallcaps">tatistics on the scope</span> of the contract-cheating industry in Canada are sparse, but the global market for custom essay-writing companies is estimated to be worth up to $21 billion (US). A 2006 study by the University of Central England suggested that Canada was among the top four countries where students engage in contract cheating. <a href="https://ucalgary.ca/news/cheating-may-be-under-reported-across-canadas-universities-and-colleges" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A more recent study</a>, from January 2020, estimates that over 70,000 post-secondary students in Canada were likely taking part in contract cheating at least once per year. That represents about 3.5 percent of the country’s post-secondary students.</p>
<p>Reliance on these services appears to have worsened during the pandemic as learning went online. A study by Alberta-based MacEwan University found that, during 2019/20, contract cheating increased nearly tenfold, due, at least in part, to the impact of the pandemic on students. These incidents are also taking place against a broader rise in academic-integrity breaches aided by technology such as ChatGPT.</p>
<p>The custom essay-writing industry can be traced as far back as the 1930s. Student newspapers, such as the <em>Varsity</em> of the University of Toronto, first posted advertisements for custom essays in the 1960s. In fact, seeing these advertisements on Canadian campuses was, until recently, quite common. Early attempts to stop the industry went nowhere. In April 1972, the Ontario legislature floated the idea of passing a new law to stop companies from helping students cheat. However, the proposed legislation failed to make it past first reading. In 1989, the Ontario court brought a landmark case against Custom Essay Service, an essay company that had been operating since the 1970s. The company was charged with one count of conspiracy to utter forged documents and seven counts of creating them. The case was eventually dismissed&mdash;but not before over 100 students faced disciplinary charges for purchasing papers from the company.</p>
<p>Experience has shown that students can pay a steep price for relying on these writing services, up to and including having their credentials withdrawn by their universities. Some students have also been blackmailed by the contract-cheating companies after they tried to cancel their payments.</p>
<p>Sarah Elaine Eaton, an associate professor at the University of Calgary’s Werklund School of Education, has been sounding the alarm over contract cheating in Canada for years. Since 2018, she has been working with teams across the country to establish anti–contract cheating measures in post-secondary institutions. A key part of that has entailed trying to get contract cheating incorporated within the definitions of academic misconduct at colleges and universities. However, Toronto Metropolitan University and MacEwan University are currently among the few post-secondary institutions that clearly incorporate contract cheating in their academic-integrity policies. This has implications for how the trend is actively tracked, says Eaton: “If universities aren’t recognizing contract cheating, or they’re subsuming it under plagiarism or collusion, then we’re not getting any data about the rates that are happening on our campuses, because they’re getting classified in inappropriate ways. You can’t solve a problem if you don’t name the problem.”</p>
<p>Even with such policies in place, detecting contract cheating can be tricky. Turnitin, the plagiarism-prevention software, is already used in Canadian universities and colleges to assess similarities to existing texts. But the software requires several writing samples from the student in question to accurately assess the authorship of the text, and it has been criticized for its low level of accuracy. It’s often up to the class instructors, or markers, to flag cases of cheating based on their assessment of the patterns in the tone, substance, or grammar in a student’s work.</p>
<p>According to Eaton, when it comes to government action on contract cheating, Canada has a long way to go compared to its counterparts in the Western world. In recent years, England and Australia have played leading roles in cracking down on cheating services. In 2020, for example, Australia passed a law making it a criminal offence to provide such services. And in 2022, the English government followed suit by outlawing any advertisements for them. Eaton attributes these countries’ success to the national quality-assurance bodies within their higher education systems that have led anti–contract cheating reforms, which have been supported by their governments. In Canada, education policies are provincial or regional responsibilities, and by and large, according to Eaton, these “quality assurance bodies have not paid much attention to contract cheating at all.”  </p>
<p>While there are no large-scale legislative efforts to tackle contract cheating in Canada, there are some specific initiatives aimed at bringing the issue to the attention of decision makers. In 2018, the Academic Integrity Council of Ontario created a sub-committee to reduce contract cheating in that province’s post-secondary institutions. That led to awareness initiatives, prevention strategies, and an articulation of clearer policies and procedures. And following the inaugural Canadian Symposium on Academic Integrity, held in Calgary in 2019, three similar networks were established, in Alberta, Manitoba, and British Columbia, to do the same.</p>
<p>Academic-integrity experts say awareness is key to pushing their agenda. However, Eaton suggests that post-secondary institutions are often reluctant to talk about the reality of contract cheating. At the University of Calgary, where she works, she says, she still finds advertisements for “Write my essay” around campus. “We’re still very much at the place [where] schools don’t want to air their dirty laundry, they don’t want to talk about taboo topics. And I think the way to address it is for schools to get together and the provincial councils to get together, acknowledge that it happens, and then work to find solutions.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smallcaps">hy are students</span> drawn to cheating in this form? According to those who work closely on these issues, several factors are at play. Amanda McKenzie, who leads the Academic Integrity Office at the University of Waterloo, says students struggling with the pressure to perform, coupled with poor time-management and organizational skills, often turn to these services: “When students get into a time crunch and get into a corner, they rationalize they can do anything that they can to maintain their work or hand it in even if they have to engage in misconduct to achieve it.”</p>
<p>She also attributes this to the commodification of education&mdash;the idea of a degree as an economic stepping stone as opposed to a means for learning and social or personal development. Over time, McKenzie says, post-secondary institutions have tended to emphasize performance, grades, and outcomes instead of learning and processes. When students feel disconnected from the process of learning, as many clearly did during the pandemic, she says, they are only more likely to engage in cheating.</p>
<p>Scholars have further suggested that systemic challenges in the academic world are shaping the growth of the contract-cheating industry. On the teaching side, work assignments can be precarious and larger class sizes can create more impersonal experiences. This almost inevitably trickles into the student experience, including a sense of dissatisfaction, which, according to at least one study, may increase the chances of students turning to contract cheating.</p>
<p>For his part, Ross says there is no one type of student that is drawn to his services. What they share in common is simply the fact that they are stressed. “[Schools] are telling students they can take a program, graduate, and get a job. And what they really end up with is $50,000 in debt and no job.” Cheating, he says, is often a last resort to simply get by.</p>
<p>Ross acknowledges that AI tools such as ChatGPT could be a threat to his work, noting he has seen a slight drop in demand in recent months. While a slew of other factors could be behind this, the popularity of the chatbot is hard to ignore. A study published by Academica Group early this year found that 43 percent of the 626 post-secondary students surveyed reported having used the AI-powered tool for their school assignments. However, only 4 percent of those queried said they used it to “write” a whole assignment.</p>
<p>In anticipation of these changes, Ross is already diversifying his business. For example, he’s hoping to launch a tutoring division to help students approach their assignments more effectively rather than simply producing papers for them. </p>
<p>Part of his business strategy is also letting his clients know that his team is made up of “human writers, not robots”&mdash;something he believes helps him stay competitive. When it comes to using ChatGPT, Ross says, he has no plans to use it in his own work “because schools have tools to detect AI.” And as these detection tools become more sophisticated, he says, he could actually see students increasingly turning to custom essay-writing services to avoid getting caught. He adds that he has no interest in getting students into trouble: “We had the option in the past to reuse papers we had already written, but we never did that since Turnitin would see it and the client would fail.” That means they would have to refund the clients and lose referrals and repeat orders; in other words, it would be bad for business. </p>
<p>Ross’s website currently has no section that explicitly warns students of the consequences of submitting work that they did not write themselves, such as getting expelled if they are caught.      Ross says students are encouraged to use his company’s work as samples to guide their own writing (though it’s clear from the site that they also expect you to simply hand in the essays they write). </p>
<p>When asked if he would have used cheating services himself when he was a student, Ross says he would have&mdash;if he had the money. He describes himself as a rebellious teenager until he got into a car accident when he was twenty-one. That forced him to take his educational goals seriously. “I went from one teacher in my first year failing my essay and telling me she thought I was an ESL student to winning second place in a provincial newspaper-writing contest four years later,” he says. And while Ross won that writing contest fair and square, he still believes that his clients, often struggling toward their own goals, should have the opportunity to do the same by whatever means it takes.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/chatgpt-ghost-writers/">How ChatGPT Is Putting College Ghostwriters Out of Work</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

Take a look back at the last few winners and you’ll see some similarities: 2022’s “October Mist” is a quietly minty green; “First Light,” from 2020, is beige with the faintest hint of blush pink; and 2019’s “Metropolitan” is essentially a glorified grey. Each one looks diluted: the ghost of a formerly vibrant shade tossed into colour jail and forced to wear an ugly, muted uniform. </p>
<p>Yet, compared to the paint colours people are <em>actually</em> buying, the annual winners seem bold and adventurous. In the US, “Classic Gray,” “Pale Oak,” and “Swiss Coffee”—all shades of off-white, barely distinguishable from one another—made Benjamin Moore’s bestseller list. Those north of the border, according to an HGTV list titled “<a href="https://www.hgtv.ca/most-popular-paint-colours-in-canada/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The 10 Most Popular Paint Colours in Canada Might Surprise You</a>,” enjoy “White Dove” and “Chantilly Lace” (both are, perhaps unsurprisingly, fancy ways of saying “plain white”). </p>

</ul>
<p>The result isn’t just interiors that feel devoid of personality but also ones that look entirely the same&mdash;decorated with flat greige accents and matching white Ikea furniture. In a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2016 article for <em>The Verge</em></a>, Kyle Chayka wrote about how Silicon Valley has helped spread that cut-and-paste aesthetic around the world. With technology touching each space we visit—restaurant recommendations on Foursquare, accommodation bookings through Airbnb&mdash;our interiors have had no choice but to morph into one another. “The interchangeability, ceaseless movement, and symbolic blankness that was once the hallmark of hotels and airports&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;has leaked into the rest of life,” Chayka wrote. “If taste is globalized, then the logical endpoint is a world in which aesthetic diversity decreases.” </p>
<p>That endpoint is peak neutral. And now that we’ve arrived, surely, we’re due for a change. </p>
<p>While colour is personal and often seen as a way to express ourselves, it also comes with a pretty thick rule book. Colour theory dictates which hues are compatible and which ones clash. Certain colours can make us feel energized, or focused, or sad, which is why you would be ill-advised to paint your bedroom an aggressive red or your kitchen bright yellow. Neutrals, by contrast, have earned a reputation as being safe&mdash;shades that are inoffensive and appeal to the masses. </p>
<p>Just scroll through condo listings in London, New York, or Toronto. They all look like showrooms ripped from the same design magazine, doomed to stay white to appease a constant turnover of tenants. That same sentiment applies to homeowners. While our homes are meant to be extensions of ourselves, as Amanda Mull, a staff writer at <em>The Atlantic</em>, told <em>Marketplace</em>, they’re also financialized. Those who plan to sell&mdash;even if it’s years down the road&mdash;are often more inclined to make design choices based on what other people seem to like. Real estate agents claim that homes painted in neutrals tend to sell more quickly than those with bold colours, and, according to a <a href="https://www.zillowgroup.com/news/paint-colors-that-could-lead-to-higher-offers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2021 survey by Zillow and Behr Paint Co.</a>, they also sell for slightly more money. White walls are a blank canvas meant to communicate “anyone could live here.” Royal purple? Not so much.  </p>
<p>Born and raised in Venezuela, Montaha Hidefi, a Guelph-based “colour archeologist” and colour-trend forecaster, notes that this is more of a Western phenomenon. Countries closer to the equator&mdash;especially parts of West Africa and South America&mdash;tend to have a different relationship with colour because of the sun: there’s more of it, which makes everything brighter and greener. By contrast, colder countries spend half the year in darkness, so they gravitate toward more sombre colours&mdash;which might help explain Scandinavia’s signature brand of space-grey minimalism. “Our preferences are influenced by our environment. A lot of people have a fear of colour because they don’t know how to react to it,” Hidefi says. “Perhaps the safest colour is no colour.”</p>
<p>But our preferences can just as easily be influenced by what’s going on around us, and Hidefi adds that each decade has a certain “visual flavour.” Amid the space race and the Cold War, the explosion of mustard yellow, blazing orange, and pimento olive green in the ’60s came to represent free love, self-expression, and the emergence of psychedelic rock. Then, in the midst of the Vietnam War, the ’70s saw a shift toward earthy tones that reflected a desire for calm and peace. But all those warm, fun colours seem to fade as we inch closer to the 2000s. </p>
<p>The turn of the millennium brought with it a new set of circumstances and challenges. The advancement of technology meant that companies were adopting silver metallics into their designs. Phones, once produced in shades of candy red and Barbie pink, morphed into silver aluminum bricks. The trend also seeped into fashion, the automotive industry, and interior design. In the following decade, Hidefi says, the turmoil of 9/11 and the 2008 financial crash created a sense of fear and uncertainty that played out in a desire to control our spaces in any ways that we could&mdash;hence the obsession with unoffending neutrals that have persisted to this day. </p>
<p>But 2023’s colour of the year has finally given us something a little bit different: Raspberry Blush. A vivacious shade of reddish orange not far from that of nearly ripe fruit. At long last, a colour with a little bit of <em>oomph</em>. The selection falls in line with what the Color Marketing Group forecasted as the key colour for North America in 2024: a neon-esque green-yellow called “Azoic.” </p>
<p>Why, all of a sudden, do we have such vibrant colours popping onto our palettes&mdash;especially at a time defined by the impending doom of the climate crisis, the war in Ukraine, and the crumbling economy?</p>
<p>What we’re experiencing now, Hidefi says, is likely a ripple effect of the pandemic. Two years of being cooped up, stuck staring at the same four walls, made us want to trade in our neutrals for explosions of colours reminiscent of adventure and excitement. Their re-emergence is a possible light at the end of what has been a difficult decade.</p>
<p>But don’t expect to wake up in a Wes Anderson–style world of colour next week. Hidefi tells me it can take months or seasons to see these trends reflected in our interiors, since they often start in fashion&mdash;the most rapid of the trend cycles&mdash;and trickle outward from there. </p>
<p>“It seems like more people are ready to accept colour in their life, but it’s a step-by-step process,” she says. “Maybe it starts with a pillowcase. Then a sofa. And, eventually, someone might find the courage to paint an entire wall.” </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/is-the-greige-era-of-design-ending/">Is the Greige Era of Design Ending?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>
