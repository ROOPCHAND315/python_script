Its studio space at 299 Queen Street West in Toronto, once famously open to anyone on the sidewalk, was the nucleus of music in Canada, the home base for original programming like <em>RapCity</em> and the Much Countdown as well as the annual MuchMusic Video Awards.</p>
<p>But that MuchMusic is dead. In 2006, after the channel’s sale to Bell Globemedia (which later became CTVglobemedia and then Bell Media), there were rounds of layoffs and programming changes, pivots and rebrandings. Specialty music channels were cut, as was much of MuchMusic’s original programming. In 2019, music videos were down to just one hour per week. Right now, it’s all reruns: endless episodes of <em>Futurama</em> and <em>Simpsons</em>&mdash;which may not have come as a surprise, since the channel eventually dropped “Music” from its name. Its VJs, who were the face of MuchMusic and doubled as hosts, journalists, and entertainers, were all let go. What’s left of MuchMusic’s legacy now lives on in its archive, which is locked away in a Bell Media library and is now being digitized. Access was limited. But former VJ Christopher Ward managed to get his hands on the material and published his oral history of MuchMusic, <em>Is This Live?: Inside the Wild Early Years of MuchMusic, the Nation’s Music Station</em>, in 2016. Material from the archives was also used by Sean Menard for his new documentary, <em>299 Queen Street West</em>, which <a href="https://schedule.sxsw.com/2023/films/2082301" rel="noopener" target="_blank">premiered at SXSW</a> and will be available <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/9981155/spirit-of-muchmusic-still-alive-at-doc-premiere-with-former-vjs-in-attendance/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on Crave</a> this December. </p>
<p>MuchMusic is often commemorated for its halcyon days, but a proper examination of the decline of media and the dearth of music coverage today can be made by taking a closer look at the outlet’s demise. In other words, the undervaluing of the arts in Canada can be seen through the slow decline of Much. The question isn’t simply “Who killed MuchMusic?” but what confluence of factors prevented it, and other media properties, from adapting. This is especially pertinent because Bell Media, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@much/video/6972133892514008326?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowXXygXGGMuZz7NvMW9VvnAod9gATdlpHgyICtR9%2Fxvlhbldl1baRq74R9x8J42hZPGgA%3D&#038;_r=1&#038;is_copy_url=1&#038;is_from_webapp=v1&#038;language=en&#038;preview_pb=0&#038;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAV_2bkS3qLNwXi93CIg_qaKodIWxaEASf5IGC5-Mwq79QAWgpXBRZlYricGME94mc&#038;share_item_id=6972133892514008326&#038;share_link_id=49954CA4-B2C5-4536-AC15-E2FF3B817B83&#038;source=h5_m&#038;timestamp=1623327290&#038;tt_from=copy&#038;u_code=dajf87ll6ihadd&#038;user_id=6790358764614992901&#038;utm_campaign=client_share&#038;utm_medium=ios&#038;utm_source=copy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">with TikTok</a>, relaunched MuchMusic as a “<a href="https://www.bellmedia.ca/the-lede/press/muchmusic-returns-as-content-driven-digital-first-network-july-7/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">content-driven digital first network</a>” in 2021 with little fanfare. To better understand why MuchMusic wasn’t able to adapt to shifting tech and viewer habits, I spoke with former and current employees individually (some preferred to stay anonymous). We discussed the channel’s many iterations and what can be learned from each of them.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n 1972</span>, Moses Znaimer put Citytv on air. It featured less polished but more specialized programming than that of other broadcasters. It was there that he met and hired producer John Martin, a British expat who was once known as the “<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/muchmusic-pioneer-john-martin-dies-1.610960" rel="noopener" target="_blank">father of rock video in Canada</a>.” Martin brought incredible musical knowledge, street smarts, and broadcasting instincts to Citytv, which allowed him to create music-oriented shows like <em>The New Music</em> and then <em>City Limits</em>, the MuchMusic precursor that debuted Mike Myers’s Wayne character that later became <em>Wayne’s World</em>. They both would take their programming quirks and guerilla-style filming from Citytv and set out to create a new music hub. </p>
<p>When they launched MuchMusic in 1984, the duo sought to quickly distinguish “the nation’s music station” from MTV, which had begun airing three years earlier. Znaimer explained that rather than bring the camera to the scene, MuchMusic would do the reverse. This approach, which Martin later described as “mould[ing] the anarchy,” altered the relationship between broadcaster and viewer, bringing music to audiences wherever they were. To further cement this relationship, Martin and director of operations Nancy Oliver would create the VJ system. VJs were the direct link between the viewer and the musician. They were like radio DJs&mdash;who not only knew their music but looked like the viewer. </p>
<p class="pull-quote">At that time, it was all live&mdash;no teleprompter, just you and the camera.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Ward (former MuchMusic VJ):</strong> George Harrison came into the studio for a one-hour live interview. When it ended, we stood there in the room, which had been quiet during the interview, but then the regular din returned with a vengeance. And there was George Harrison looking around the room, where people were yelling into phones [because the MuchMusic office was right there], moving cameras, carrying things, and shouting conversations across the room. He looked around and went, “This is a very casual program.” So as I got my moment of understated Beatle wit, I also got an epitaph of MuchMusic, all in one moment.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Heydon (former senior producer, creative services):</strong> Moses’s direction and John’s was to just do what you do. Radio had tight programming formats and Moses resisted that, saying that we had to make instinctive decisions and develop our own personality&mdash;and that all boiled down to taste.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160009" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160009" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/McCullogh_MuchMusic_MichaelHeydon_1800_01.jpeg" alt="A scan from Much Music’s Rock Handbook, published in the &#039;80s, with images of cast and crew members." width="1200" height="800" class="size-full wp-image-160009" srcset="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/McCullogh_MuchMusic_MichaelHeydon_1800_01.jpeg 1200w, https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/McCullogh_MuchMusic_MichaelHeydon_1800_01-735x490.jpeg 735w, https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/McCullogh_MuchMusic_MichaelHeydon_1800_01-348x232.jpeg 348w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160009" class="wp-caption-text">A scan from Much Music’s <em>Rock Handbook</em>, published in the &#8217;80s, with images of cast and crew members (Courtesy of Michael Heydon)</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Michael Williams (former VJ):</strong> There’s that Top 40 mantra [in radio]: let’s play only these forty songs until people can sing it and brainwash them with that. We weren’t that. John Martin and Nancy Oliver said: We’ve got tape, cameras, all the airtime you want. Do what you want&mdash;we just don’t have any money. </p>
<p><strong>Heydon:</strong> There wasn’t going to be any formula. There wasn’t going to be some program manager from CHUM coming down to weekly meetings to advise us on strategy. We wouldn’t be radio. We wouldn’t be MTV.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Bobek (former national publicity manager):</strong> At the time, the music industry was very regional, and one thing that MuchMusic did was break all that down. What I mean is that you had stars on the east coast or the west coast that weren’t known in Winnipeg or Toronto. And what really gave strength to the Canadian industry was part of John Martin’s thinking, which was: if nobody knows who k.&thinsp;d. lang is, we can put k.&thinsp;d. lang in rotation next to Bruce Springsteen and Elton John.</p>
<p class="pull-quote">It was the best fun you could have with your clothes on and no drugs. You couldn’t break the rules because there were really no rules to break.</p>
<p><strong>Erica Ehm (former VJ):</strong> MuchMusic was this great alchemy of music, pushing the envelope and an undercurrent of chaos. That meant that it was a forum for discussion and rich conversation&mdash;also that interviews were long, live, and unedited. You never knew where they were going to go next. Our bosses never directed the conversation. When I sat down with a band, no one knew what I would be asking them. No one vetted my questions. It was up to me, for better or for worse. We respected the audience, and the audience respected us back. We respected the artists, and they respected us back.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Crawford (former publicist for MuchMusic and vice president of social policy and media literacy at CHUM):</strong> It was <em>live</em> live. The weird thing about MuchMusic at the time: it was the only place where this would happen. It was quite unusual in that respect.</p>
<p><strong>Ehm:</strong> The person that I was off camera is the same person that I was on camera. That was the same for all people they hired in the earlier days. Everybody was hired because they had this burning passion to talk about music. </p>
<p><strong>Ward:</strong> We were given phenomenal amounts of freedom by John and Moses. But there was some serious thinking going on behind the veneer of fun and games, and then we were let loose. I dedicated my book to John, “for winding us up and letting go.” And he would: I’d get maybe ten words out of him and then not see him for a week.</p>
<p><strong>Williams:</strong> It was the best fun you could have with your clothes on and no drugs. You couldn’t break the rules because there were really no rules to break. There were no impediments because the record companies had no clue: no clue what [music] videos were or what we were doing. They were riding by the seat of their pants and profiting off of everything we did. </p>
<p><strong>Ward:</strong> For the first few years, we didn’t have to answer to the sales department. The VJs decided who to play and who got exposure. We were screening videos every single weekend. </p>
<p><strong>Williams:</strong> We all were teachers of music for at least three generations of Canadians. MuchMusic also forced CBC Radio and other broadcasters to play music by artists they would never consider. That was important because the country needed to be pushed in a direction that would facilitate success for the local, national, or Canadian artists and give them a platform to go international. </p>
<p><strong>Ward:</strong> We were wielding power with a lot of consideration. We were willing to stand by what we believed in and followed that through by continuing to support acts and helping them build long-term careers. An act like Blue Rodeo was floundering until we programmed their first video, “Try.” Other artists told us that as soon as their video aired on MuchMusic, they couldn’t step into a grocery store.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">s MuchMusic gained</span> traction and credibility, the working relationship between Martin and Znaimer dissipated, according to Denise Donlon, former director of music programming, in her memoir, <em>Fearless as Possible</em>. Znaimer’s management strategy was always described as “benign neglect,” but he was known for having high standards. Martin, on the other hand, had boundless creativity and resourcefulness but wasn’t, in a corporate sense, reliable. For instance, Ward wrote in his book that before Live Aid aired in July 1985, Ward and Heydon had scored an interview with organizer Bob Geldof. As they wrapped, Geldof asked for Martin’s number so they could talk. Ward and Heydon had to call their boss at his “other office,” a bar across the street. </p>
<p>Znaimer prepared to let Martin go and had already approached Donlon, then <em>New Music</em> host and producer, to be his replacement, according to her. As Donlon explained, it put her in a painful position as it was Martin who had initially hired her. After he gave her his blessing, Martin officially resigned from MuchMusic on December 8, 1992, and Donlon took over as director of music programming.</p>
<p>Donlon summed up her era, in an interview with the <em>Globe and Mail</em>, as a “drive for relevancy.” As she explains in her memoir, pop culture was shaping every aspect of modern life in the early ’90s, and that was reflected in ballooning music video budgets, where big-name directors were commanding seven figures. As more videos hit the airwaves, there was more competition for the spotlight. The commercial success of a song now hinged on the strength of its video because, according to Donlon, “[w]ithout Much and MTV, your success was limited.” If your video wasn’t good, it wasn’t requested at MuchMusic and therefore not played. </p>
<p class="pull-quote">The instructions were to make everything look like MTV. We were going away from what everybody adored about MuchMusic and its uniqueness.</p>
<p>At the time, Donlon noticed that the more meaningful aspects of music, like community and connection, were getting lost in all the glitz and glamour. She pushed to unpack videos in more depth and hired VJs with distinctive styles and opinions, like Namugenyi “Nam” Kiwanuka, Sook-Yin Lee, George Stroumboulopoulos, and Rick “The Temp” Campanelli. Defined by her passion for activism, a large part of her mandate prioritized media literacy, with a “Too Much 4 Much” segment where VJs, special guests, and artists analyzed controversial videos that were banned from the airwaves.</p>
<p>Though there was now pressure from sales and marketing to please advertisers and shareholders, Donlon insisted on preserving the quality of program messaging instead of pandering to the lowest common denominator. From 1992 until 2000, she challenged and analyzed the rock and roll lifestyle instead of shilling for it. Under her, MuchMusic simultaneously demystified celebrity and political figures and the making of television.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis Saunders (former MuchMusic technical director):</strong> Knowing that Denise was going to be inheriting the mantle [was] comforting [because] she knew us. She was a smart, articulate [person who] shared the same passion for music. She was aware of the game [with advertisers] and far more willing [to] play it.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;John was detached a little before it happened. </p>
<p><strong>Bobek:</strong> John Martin would have verbal battles with the marketing department because they wanted to start playing the Monkees and TV shows like that. That started in ’92 or ’93&mdash;you know, around the time of his departure. That shift was happening. It was becoming more corporate, and it was looking at, you know, how can we better sell advertising time? </p>
<p><strong>Donlon:</strong> The audience wasn’t coming to us to be preached at. Watching MuchMusic could never feel like they were going to school, but we were hoping to just inject a little spinach every now and then in between all that sugary-candy goodness. </p>
<p><strong>Heydon:</strong> We were trying to be aware of what our younger audience cared about, what they were interested in, and what we could offer them that they didn’t know to be interested in. During federal elections, we started bringing in major leaders to spar with Avi Lewis and VJs Jennifer Hollett and Sook-Yin Lee. [Editor’s note: Jennifer Hollett, executive director of The Walrus, was not involved in the commissioning or editing of this story.]
<p><strong>Donlon:</strong> Hiring VJs was a part of that: I was not interested in somebody who wanted to be famous. It was really about what would you do with this platform. For young people, we needed feet on the ground and for on-air talent to be interested. </p>
<p><strong>Kiwanuka:</strong> The first day I was on camera, I was interviewing the Pet Shop Boys. At that time, it was all live&mdash;no teleprompter, just you and the camera. And my first throw: Denise Donlon was standing off to the right with her arms crossed. All these things are happening&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;There was no such thing as “quiet on the set.” It was people doing whatever they’re doing behind you: phones ringing, people knocking at the windows.</p>
<figure id="attachment_160022" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160022" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" src="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/McCullogh_MuchMusic_MichaelHeydon_1800_02.jpeg" alt="A scan from Much Music’s Rock Handbook published in the &#039;80s with images of cast and crew members." width="1200" height="800" class="size-full wp-image-160022" srcset="https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/McCullogh_MuchMusic_MichaelHeydon_1800_02.jpeg 1200w, https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/McCullogh_MuchMusic_MichaelHeydon_1800_02-735x490.jpeg 735w, https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/McCullogh_MuchMusic_MichaelHeydon_1800_02-348x232.jpeg 348w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-160022" class="wp-caption-text">A scan from Much Music’s <em>Rock Handbook</em> (Courtesy of Michael Heydon)</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Donlon:</strong> The audience was used to seeing our mistakes on air. And that was part of the attraction: we had no idea what was going to happen. It was live, with no teleprompters. It’s partly about making sure that you’ve got the right people in place. One thing is you can’t teach curiosity. You can’t learn a sense of fairness and balance, so supporting the people who were there was really key to playing more freely.</p>
<p><strong>Kiwanuka:</strong> Eventually, I became used to just having free-flowing information in my head and no teleprompter. Even when we did those hour-and-a-half-long interviews or performances at Much&mdash;I would have the information in my head.</p>
<p><strong>Campanelli:</strong> The thing that brought us and the fans together was when they opened the doors of the studio on Queen and John. We were at street level, so we were accessible to people walking down Queen. At MTV, they were on the second floor at Times Square and almost untouchable. At Much, you got a glimpse of what was going on inside, or you could be part of the environment as an audience member. We weren’t really speaking <em>to</em> young Canadians; we were speaking <em>with</em> young Canadians. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smallcaps">avid Kines</span>, who was there at the launch of MuchMusic in 1983 and worked there as an editor, became vice president and general manager in 2000. But with the title came the advent of technological change. He and director of music programming Sheila Sullivan would have to devise new methods to compete for the attention of the audience that MuchMusic once commanded.</p>
<p>Napster had been online for a year, and that started to shift the relationship between listeners and their music. Suddenly, if someone wanted to listen to a particular song, they didn’t have to wait to buy it in a record store or hear it on the radio or MuchMusic; they could just download it. With the launches of the iPod and iTunes in 2001 and YouTube in 2005, millennials became the music-on-demand generation. That immediate gratification altered how music was valued, and there was a shift in demand from full albums to singles. It’s worth noting that at its height in 1999, the music industry made $22.7 billion (US) in revenue off of music recordings, <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2021/06/15/us-recorded-music-revenues-46-percent-lower/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to data</a> from the Recording Industry Association of America. </p>
<p>At the same time, MTV also set out to launch in Canada. In 2001, its CRTC (the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission) licence was approved, though it limited its programming of music videos. As a result, MTV Canada had a lineup peppered with reality shows produced both in Canada and the US. MuchMusic took notice and began a push for reality television programming of its own, including <em>Much in Your Space</em>, <em>Fandemonium</em>, <em>disBand</em>, and <em>MuchMusic VJ Search</em>. </p>
<p>Despite the pressure to emulate MTV, MuchMusic was still governed by <a href="https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1984/db84-338.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">strict CRTC guidelines</a>. When the channel launched in 1984, the CanCon requirement was a minimum of 10 percent of all music videos aired, with that number set to increase to 20 percent by its third year of operation and to grow by 5 percent each year thereafter. The channel was now in a bind: it was chasing the audience it once engaged. There was seemingly no plan to get ahead of the audience and the growing importance of the internet. Viewership started to dwindle. Corporate blandification further took over: producers were no longer allowed to experiment. They had to follow scripts, get approvals, and watch MTV for ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Campanelli:</strong> With the advent of cellphones and all this stuff, kids were definitely in control of what they wanted. Dave Kines was so technical way back in the day. I remember him holding up a flip phone and telling us [the phone] is going to dictate how TV, as we know it, will be watched. </p>
<p><strong>Craig Halket (former VJ and programmer for MuchMusic):</strong> David Kines was nicknamed “Mr. TV.” He is a brilliant broadcaster. He definitely had a passion for music, but he wasn’t connected to the street level. Sheila Sullivan became director of music programming. She came with no actual music programming experience. Her strengths were about being aggressive, not progressive.</p>
<p><strong>Kines:</strong> I’m sure people will blame me for MuchMusic being what it was. “Denise Donlon turned it into the cerebral channel, and then Kines just let it become the reality channel with <em>The Osbournes</em>.” You’ve got corporate masters, and anyone that thinks it should still be playing music videos&mdash;that’s just not a sustainable business model.</p>
<p><strong>Campanelli:</strong> Around that time, I started thinking to myself that I got into this for the music and now these reality shows are popping up. It was becoming less about the music and the bands. </p>
<p class="pull-quote">Everyone kept hearing that they were trying to get out of playing music.</p>
<p><strong>Kines:</strong> The channel got more focused and scripted because there was more at stake. </p>
<p><strong>Matt Wells (former MuchMusic and MuchMoreMusic host):</strong> I remember there were times when I would hear from a producer&mdash;who was just relaying information from their bosses&mdash;saying, “The ratings aren’t great, and we’re going to have to start playing some more mainstream videos.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve Kerzner (Ed the Sock):</strong> In the program director’s office, there was a TV constantly running MTV. And every time you went in there, she’d say, “Why can’t we do shows like that?” </p>
<p><strong>Wells:</strong> As you got more ingrained in the company, you understood that if people aren’t watching this show, you need to get eyeballs on it. But there’s got to be a balance between the early days of MuchMusic&mdash;where you build, nurture, and let the audience find it&mdash;and the accountant or lawyer who says the demographics and statistics tell us that this is what kids will watch. </p>
<p><strong>Kerzner:</strong> They lost the plot, tried to copy MTV with a small fraction of the budget and resources, and tried to justify it with “Well, this is popular on MTV, this is what the kids like.” As soon as you start talking like that, you’re separating yourself from your audience in a profound way.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">his next part</span> of MuchMusic’s history reflects the history of all media in Canada: consolidation. In 2003, Znaimer left CHUM (amid some speculation that he had been pushed out), the parent company of Citytv and MuchMusic. The following year, CHUM purchased all the MTV Canada channels and then promptly shut them down. Not too long after, it all cumulated with MuchMusic being acquired by Bell Globemedia (later CTVglobemedia and then Bell), a behemoth that controlled some of the biggest media properties in Canada. This would, in many ways, be the beginning of the end for MuchMusic. </p>
<p><strong>Kerzner:</strong> The company, all of a sudden, had six vice presidents. And it became much more corporate. Moses started to be seen as a liability because he was mercurial and governed by his passions and inspirations. That didn’t bode well for [corporate] stability.</p>
<p><strong>Heydon:</strong> At the very end, CTV [which now owned MuchMusic] started clearing out libraries and rooms in the building. I saw that many of Moses’s mementos had been taken from a fifth-floor library, including master tapes of shows he had developed&mdash;historic things that were dear to him. I found awards and framed stills too (including <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/author/leonard-cohen/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Leonard Cohen</a>’s “I Am a Hotel”)&mdash;all of which were destined for the dumpster in the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>Williams:</strong> [CTVglobemedia] buying MuchMusic [and] all the radio stations&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;that’s not good for the country [because] if the government had not given those licences to [them], they would have probably created another two dozen media companies&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;put more money into the system. They also would have created a system that kept local broadcasting going [instead of trying to] program the whole country. </p>
<p><strong>Donlon:</strong> After I left, I was invited to be part of the board at CHUM. I was there during the sale. I didn’t physically negotiate it but saw it going down. I was very involved, largely because I was one of the few independent members of the board. In terms of what was about to happen with Much and MTV because of the sale&mdash;that meant that suddenly MuchMusic and a number of those specialty channels were now under the same ownership.</p>
<p><strong>Williams:</strong> Diversity in media does not exist in terms of media ownership.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;We had MuchMusic and I don’t think anything’s left now. I went there a couple of times after I left, and it was just a different animal. That’s what happens when you’re bought and sold.</p>
<p><strong>Donlon:</strong> From a business point of view, you’re going to have to pare down duplication so that it can work on the ledger side. That’s what I was nervous about: that there was going to be some fallout. I was hoping that the impact on the Canadian cultural industries wasn’t going to be bad.</p>
<p><strong>Heydon:</strong> After CTV bought the channel in 2006, they started letting people go. Ivan Fecan, who was president and CEO of Bell Globemedia at the time, met to reassure us. He explained that even though all of the CHUM channels, including MuchMusic, had been bought, it was because Bell Globemedia believed in them&mdash;we had built the channels to the point where they were attractive to them, so they were going to let us do what we did. They wanted us to be part of the team and successful together. In practice, that didn’t turn out to be quite true. The truth was that people continued to be laid off every week. Over the next couple of years, hundreds of us became efficiencies. I was one of 105 staff members laid off on November 27, 2008. The entire staff of MuchMoreMusic was gathered and told they were no longer needed. It was very dehumanizing and quite traumatic.</p>
<p><strong>Halket:</strong> The instructions were to make everything look like MTV. We were going away from what everybody adored about MuchMusic and its uniqueness&mdash;to get in line with MTV. It was a very difficult time at that point. And people were fending for their jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Liana Kerzner (former producer and host at Citytv and CHUM):</strong> The chain of command got a little weird&mdash;there was a dual management structure, which I think was part of the problem. Nobody could make a decision. You had some excellent content purchasers, but you didn’t have an overarching idea for a channel mandate, and so it splintered and became irrelevant.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n 2008</span>, Brad Schwartz became senior vice president and general manager of the Much MTV Group. In addition to reviving some specialty music shows, including <em>The Wedge</em> (alternative and indie music) and <em>RapCity</em> (hip hop), Schwartz focused MuchMusic’s programming on more youth-oriented drama shows out of America, like <em>Pretty Little Liars</em> and <em>The Secret Life of the American Teenager</em>.</p>
<p>But there was no stability for the workers at MuchMusic. In 2011, Bell acquired CTV and began a new round of layoffs, resulting in a skeletal crew. In 2014 and 2015, many of the staff were let go. MuchMusic died quietly. And despite op-eds complaining about the state of the channel, journalists weren’t really examining the larger implications of buyouts and media consolidation until it was too late.  </p>
<p><strong>Schwartz:</strong> It became obvious that music videos were just not a linear product anymore: a music video in the credits of <em>Pretty Little Liars</em> was going to get a lot more people watching it than scheduling an hour of music videos. Nobody would watch an hour of videos to catch the video they liked. But a million people watch <em>Pretty Little Liars</em>. </p>
<p><strong>Kines:</strong> I don’t know if you can pin the end of MuchMusic on Brad Schwartz, but under his watch, they basically turned it into an MTV channel. It was an inevitable evolution.</p>
<p><strong>Schwartz:</strong> We still wanted to be a curator and a guide. And that’s why we aired less music videos in this brand reinvigoration. We rebranded MuchMusic to just Much. And we changed the logo. The old Much logo, as amazing as it was, was not very good when you think about it being on iPads and iPhones. We created something that was much more elegant for a digital business. We took the word “Music” off the logo and started really diving into a lot of scripted youth content. We built a channel where music was more of a brand expression than content experience.</p>
<p><strong>Damian Abraham (former host of <em>The Wedge</em>):</strong> There was just so much excitement [and] hope.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;These two shows were going to come back and save MuchMusic. That was definitely said to me multiple times, like, <em>MuchMusic is back</em>. At the same time, there was definitely those conversations early on, where [we were] looking at the ratings being like, well, this is not working. Some days, towards the end, [we] were on at 6 a.m. on a Sunday with no promotion and somehow we would carry the day and be the most-watched show. Which was not to say we had high ratings.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;That speaks to where MuchMusic’s ratings were at the time.  </p>
<p><strong>Anonymous:</strong> I remember starting and was like, <em>this is so cool, music is my job</em>, but immediately it was like, “Get to know Marianas Trench and Hedley.” It was a culture shock for me, but that was the market they were relying on. This is 2009, and they were very focused on tweens and teens. That was the demographic. It was not people my age.</p>
<p><strong>Schwartz:</strong> The thing that makes MTV and MuchMusic and anything that targets young people successful is to understand your audience and where trends are going to be ahead of the curve&mdash;that’s what advertisers look to us for, that we’re always focused on emergent trends as opposed to residual trends. When you’re just constantly focused on what young people are interested in, then you can create a brand and a content mix that will forge an emotional attachment. We are constantly focused on the future.</p>
<p><strong>Abraham: </strong>The thing that was really demoralizing is when we would have [these] moments where [something] would land in our laps and I would bring it to the higher-ups and that would get shot down. We had this big meeting and they’re like, “If we don’t have a show that rates out of the box with no promotion, you’re all gonna lose your jobs.” So I called my friend [who was running] the Vice Toronto office and I [asked] if Vice would ever want to do a show on MuchMusic. This was before Viceland or any of that stuff. So [we] brainstormed a rough idea for a Noisey TV show.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;I made a meeting to talk to [the Much higher-ups]. And I went into the meeting, and I’m like, “Hey, have you heard about Vice?” and the response was, “Kind of.” And it just went south from there.</p>
<p><strong>Anonymous:</strong> When Bell came in, there was just so much red tape. To do anything, everyone needed signatures. Original programming was just filling a quota for CanCon/CRTC regulations. Everyone kept hearing that they were trying to get out of playing music. There was an hour during the day where they played videos and that was only out of necessity, and then the rest of it was at night when nobody was awake.</p>
<p><strong>Schwartz:</strong> There were always people ragging and shitting on MuchMusic. Reminiscing backwards makes it easier to shit on something. If MuchMusic and MTV do their job right, then they are like a high school: all they have to do is be important for those four years that you’re going through it. Once you’re out of the demo, you shouldn’t watch it. You shouldn’t like it, because now we’re focused on the kids that are here. If you’re forty years old and still liking Much, then we’ve grown old with our audience instead of staying perpetually young. You shouldn’t be watching MuchMusic anymore. It’s not for you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Anonymous:</strong> I remember when the twenty-fifth or thirtieth anniversary that rolled around and they didn’t celebrate it. And it’s because they didn’t want to appear old. They were trying to market to teenagers, and turning that age made them look old.</p>
<p><strong>Abraham:</strong> I think they spent their whole time <em>chasing away their demo</em>. The problem was eventually there’s not a younger demo to [get] because [they’re] not watching TV the same way. As it became a pop station, and you saw the same thing happen with MTV, it was very interesting to watch these two parallel downfalls&mdash;just them being completely unable to pivot. I think there was such an arrogance that they would always say they’re the most valuable youth brand in Canada, and after a certain point, it’s like, <em>Yeah, well, to who?</em> </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smallcaps">n June 7, 2021</span>, it was announced that Bell Media and TikTok would “team up for the relaunch of MuchMusic,” at least initially by bringing on new VJs and “creators that speak directly to Gen Z and younger Millennials.” Bell Media is <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/bell-media-confirms-plans-to-redevelop-299-queen-st-building-move-studios-temporarily/article_071e8c54-f196-5700-830b-74da3acaa8a7.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">also redeveloping</a> 299 Queen Street West. But just up the street, in what used to be a CHUM gift shop, is a small studio space for the new iteration of MuchMusic. A sticker on the window marks it off from the street. </p>
<p>I’m assured by David Krikst (head of MuchMusic) that the relaunch will stay true to the early days of MuchMusic. “Every generation has their own version of MuchMusic,” Krikst tells me, “but I’m really energized by the kids who didn’t know the brand.” </p>
<p>MuchMusic’s downfall occurred in parallel with the decline of music journalism at large in Canada. Venues have been shutting down, newspapers have gutted music coverage, alt weeklies <a href="https://www.canadaland.com/podcast/death-alt-weekly/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">are dying</a>, and music outlets aren’t holding up. The Doug Ford government has also been slowly eroding the Ontario Arts Council by <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/ontario-eliminates-indigenous-culture-fund-cuts-millions-for-the-arts-1.4437886?cache=" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cutting</a> its <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4762100/ontario-arts-council-cuts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">funding</a>. “I don’t want to be all doom and gloom,” says journalist and former pop culture reporter Hannah Sung, “but I do think there’s a real lack of paid work for journalists to cover music in Canada. When we think about how central music is to our enjoyment of life and the way we connect with other people and our own communities, how few critics there are really blows your mind.” </p>
<p>Bell is still sitting on the channel’s archives that hold the history of broadcasting in Canada and gems like the final interview with Tupac and one of the final interviews with Kurt Cobain. The tapes have not been digitized or even labelled correctly, and after a flood and possible thefts, no one except Bell’s librarian knows what remains. When I first began interviewing former employees of MuchMusic three years ago, many expressed frustration with Bell because they had tried to reach out, offering to digitize and organize the archive, but were met with silence.</p>
<p>That seems to have changed for the upcoming MuchMusic documentary, <em>299 Queen Street West</em>, which gave director Sean Menard unprecedented access to the archive. The documentary seems to be a passion project (or damage control tactic) for Bell: while the MuchMusic relaunch flails on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/tiktok/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TikTok</a>, Justin Stockman, vice president of English content development and programming at Bell, is credited as the documentary’s executive producer. </p>
<p>With every celebration of its launch or anniversary, MuchMusic becomes more of a cautionary tale, a reminder of what could have been. As I passed the new MuchMusic space late last year, I saw the new generation of VJs banging on the window, trying to get passersby to stop and talk. They were mostly ignored.</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-rise-and-fall-of-muchmusic/">The Rise and Fall of MuchMusic</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

The thing you throw on over nothing else because it reduces you to a shapeless blob, an impenetrable mass devoid of emotion, shape, or gender? That’s the dysphoria hoodie, something that hides your body and gender expression from wandering&mdash;and potentially misunderstanding&mdash;eyes. </p>
<p>It’s an item born more for function than fashion, one that lacks any room for personal style or expression. Yet it’s been adopted en masse by mainstream brands looking to appeal to gender-ambiguous shoppers. Look at the “gender-neutral” lines of mainstream mall brands like Old Navy, Roots, and H&#038;M and you’ll find a lot of dysphoria hoodies&mdash;items meant to affirm but seemingly designed to avoid any sense of silhouette, pattern, or colour. Based off the offerings of most mainstream apparel brands, you’d think “gender-free” was synonymous with no fun&mdash;ironic considering many of us who identify outside the gender binary often present ourselves in fruity and extra ways. Last year, a set of button-ups from Old Navy were shared on Twitter (now X) among transmasculine folks, and one of the shirts had a vibrant orange print&mdash;and I do mean orange as in the fruit.</p>
<p>For the bottom line of these brands, launching so-called “gender-neutral” lines of hoodies and sweatpants makes sense. A <a href="https://www.theindustry.fashion/gen-z-fashion-report-shows-65-want-gender-neutral-search-option-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2022 Unidays survey</a> found that 65 percent of Gen Z respondents believe brands should provide gender-neutral clothing. Non-binary and trans folks are another market to target, as are cis people looking for fits or styles outside of traditionally “gendered” silhouettes, and mass-producing shapeless fabric blobs is easy enough. But it also means pretty much every other clothing item&mdash;jeans, dresses, shirts, pants, and more&mdash;remains in the clutches of the gender binary.</p>

</ul>
<p>As a non-binary person, I find it unfortunate to see the only clothes marketed to me come from the haute couture dysphoria hoodie line. Maybe I, an ostensibly gender-neutral person, want to wear hard pants or shirts or dresses or literally anything besides androgynous, shapeless hoodies. Just because something isn’t explicitly for “men” or “women” doesn’t mean it has to be boring as sin. I’m definitely in the “dismantle the gender binary” camp, and a good place to start would be imagining more clothing sections than what we’ve got now: “men,” &#8220;women,” and “hoodies.” </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t wasn’t always</span> like this. Our modern conception of gender and clothing is a relatively recent development in the grand scheme of history. </p>
<p>For much of human existence, clothes were largely made to keep people warm and covered up. As style evolved in the late Middle Ages, it actually became in vogue for men in Europe to wear tights to accentuate the legs. Pants became masculine attire only in the sixteenth century; previously, both men and women wore what modern people would call skirts and dresses. Over time, clothing started to be used primarily to distinguish between men and women rather than to express social position.</p>
<p>But the modern fashion industry has periodically leaned toward androgyny. In the 1960s, models like Twiggy pioneered a hyper-thin, teenage-bodied, short-haired version of feminine androgyny. The “unisex” movement of 1968 saw runway designers imagine a genderless world of sleek silhouettes. In recent years, celebrities like Billy Porter and Harry Styles have donned dresses on magazine covers and red carpets. </p>
<p>But what Styles wears on the cover of <em>Vogue</em> is very different from what’s typically marketed as unisex clothing. According to the 2021 census, one in 300 people in Canada aged fifteen and older identified themselves as transgender or non-binary. Two-thirds of those respondents were under the age of thirty-five&mdash;which could indicate that age group is increasingly embracing fluid definitions of gender. And that doesn’t include the folks who identify as cis and are looking for gender-diverse fashion&mdash;I’ve commiserated with many cis butch lesbians about the lack of accessible “men’s” pants for our body types. The need to move beyond today’s potato-sack-esque offerings is clear.   </p>
<p>Marie-Eve Faust, a professor at the Université du Québec à Montréal who specializes in fashion management, sizing, and sustainability, says there’s an ease to mass-producing for the familiar “male” or “female” silhouette with little variation. Since many clothing brands are resistant to trying anything that could impact their bottom lines, they’re more likely to stick to what they know. </p>
<p>“If you’re doing garments for women, and you know that this is for one specific target market, it’s easier because your target is well defined,” Faust says. “Whereas if everyone moves towards having gender-neutral [clothes], you’re not having your specific target market to yourself.”</p>
<p>Even companies that are trying to move away from the binary haven’t been able to include everyone. Brands like Both&#038; or Wildfang, which market masculine styles of clothing to folks who don’t have traditionally cis male bodies, are attempting to fill the gap of catering “male” clothing to a so-called “female silhouette” by selling button-up shirts that don’t ride up over wider hips, or pants with wider waist measurements proportional to shorter inseams. </p>
<p>But what does it mean to have an “AFAB” (assigned female at birth) body, as Both&#038; suggests is its target audience? Is it me: five feet six, 210 pounds, a thirty-six-inch waist, and a surgically flattened chest, plus nearly two years on gender-affirming hormone therapy? Is it my five-foot-nine cisgender girlfriend? Or is it a non-binary pal who’s five feet tall and wears a 4X in “women’s” pants? Ostensibly, we are all “AFAB,” but that does little to help categorize us or guarantee that the brand’s clothing will fit any of us.</p>
<p>It’s a problem I encounter in my endless search for pants. At five feet six, I land on the lower end of “men’s” pant inseams. But my wider hips mean I hit the upper end of waist sizes. Finding affordable options that fit me both ways is essentially impossible, so I often pay extra to get my jeans hemmed.</p>
<p>And notably, there’s an even greater lack of inclusive fashion catered to transfeminine folks or cis men looking for feminine clothes. My struggle to find short king pants is hard, but it might be even harder for someone with broad shoulders to find a bra that fits. And while transmasculine folks can dip into boys sizing for our shoes, drag queens can attest to the challenge in finding a size fourteen high heel. This discrepancy can likely be chalked up to misogyny: shifting toward the masculine end of the spectrum is acceptable, but God forbid someone’s masculinity should be threatened by a desire to be more feminine. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">hese struggles are</span> at the heart of a concerted push to show brands that there is a market outside of those “traditional”&mdash;and often hyper-thin&mdash;silhouettes in mainstream fashion. Queer and trans folks looking for accessible and size-inclusive clothing outside of the gender binary could be an untapped market and money-making potential for mainstream brands. But outside of the financial benefits, giving people what they actually want and need should be motivation enough.</p>
<p>In 2021, Samuel Braemer co-founded Transforming Style, a personal styling and shopping service targeted at LGBTQ2+ folks, as a way to help them navigate the economic and emotional barriers of the fashion world. They help clients through virtual consultations and in-person shopping, regardless of their gender. </p>
<p>The team recently worked with a thirteen-year-old trans girl in Calgary to help craft a wardrobe for her first time at public school after being home-schooled her whole life. </p>
<p>“We worked with her and her parents to provide her with a wardrobe representative of herself,” he said. “A couple of weeks later, her mum sent us an email with photos of her and said that it was life changing and now she sees herself reflected in the mirror.”</p>
<p>Braemer says personal shopping can be helpful as a support for folks looking to brave in-person shopping.</p>
<p>“It can be very overwhelming to go into a big-box store, a boutique, you know, a mall to shop for your true self,” he says. “The categorization can be overwhelming when it&#8217;s categorized by gender.”</p>
<p>An easy answer to the problem of categorization is to mass-produce dysphoria hoodies. But a better solution is doing away with categories altogether by designing clothes that fit a variety of bodies rather than imposing a third “gender-neutral” categorization on consumers. </p>
<p>Lydia Okello, a non-binary model, writer, and content creator who focuses on fat-centred fashion and queerness, says they hope for a world where you can walk into a mainstream retail store and see clothing sorted by style and sizing instead of gender. </p>
<p>“I don’t think that it helps anyone shop better,” they say. “I think it’s just prescribing gender to a piece of clothing that is inanimate and has no gender prescribed.”</p>
<p>They believe that de-gendering fashion will not only provide more space for trans and non-binary folks but also encourage people who haven’t experimented with fashion or expression to do so. Maybe a big cis guy looking for something cozy to wear at home would buy a caftan if it came in his size and wasn’t segregated in the “women’s” section. Maybe more cis women would feel free to experiment outside of traditionally feminine styles if more masculine clothes were accessible to them. </p>
<p>“My dream is a landscape in which people don’t feel afraid to venture out of their usual visual selection,” Okello says. “I think that would be a really exciting world to live in.”</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/gender-neutral-clothing/">What “Gender-Neutral” Fashion Gets Wrong</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

There would be a shuffling of papers, and the officer might inform me about an assault, a break-in, an arrest, or a charge.</p>
<p>It was a quick and easy way to provide fodder for the newspaper, and in those days, it didn’t even occur to reporters to question the validity of any of the information offered. Nor did our editors ever suggest we try to get the perspective of the person charged before running their name in the paper.</p>
<p>Police were considered an authoritative source, worthy of trust and able to supply unchallenged facts about everything from minor incidents to shootings and murders. To a large extent, this remains true today. Crime news has been a staple of the media for centuries. It’s seen as urgent and entertaining, something everyone will want to read. Even the smallest newsrooms are guaranteed a reliable stream of stories from their police calls, and many local news outlets traditionally assign a reporter exclusively to the police beat. A US study once found that nearly 14 percent of all full-time reporters said they covered crime or police. </p>

<p>Imagine, then, what a police reporter would have concluded after reading the following press release from the Minneapolis Police Department. </p>
<blockquote><p>MAN DIES AFTER MEDICAL INCIDENT DURING POLICE INTERACTION</p>
<p>May 25, 2020 (MINNEAPOLIS) On Monday evening, shortly after 8:00 pm, officers from the Minneapolis Police Department responded to the 3700 block of Chicago Avenue South on a report of a forgery in progress. Officers were advised that the suspect was sitting on top of a blue car and appeared to be under the influence. Two officers arrived and located the suspect, a male believed to be in his 40s, in his car. He was ordered to step from his car. After he got out, he physically resisted officers. Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress.</p>
<p>Officers called for an ambulance. He was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center by ambulance where he died a short time later.<br />
At no time were weapons of any type used by anyone involved in this incident.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has been called in to investigate this incident at the request of the Minneapolis Police Department.</p>
<p>No officers were injured in the incident. </p></blockquote>
<p>The headline of this police communication might just as well have read: “Nothing to see here, folks. Move along.” Police officers were merely detaining someone in a forgery case. They noticed he was in medical distress and helpfully called an ambulance. Unfortunately, he died, though thankfully no officers were injured in the process. No weapons “of any type” were used in this incident.</p>
<p>Based on this press release, it’s unlikely this would have even made the local news. Instead, the murder of George Floyd triggered worldwide protests and a racial reckoning in society that continues to reverberate far beyond Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the truth, seventeen-year-old Darnella Frazier captured the scene on her phone and posted it online for the world to see. It shows all the things the Minneapolis Police Department’s press release carefully omits: that a police officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for nine minutes and twenty-nine seconds; that Floyd repeatedly protested he couldn’t breathe; that other officers stood by and didn’t do anything. The press statement didn’t just lie by omitting crucial evidence. It also misrepresented the sequence of events, pretending that Floyd was in medical distress as he was being handcuffed when the police themselves were the cause of his distress. It was an attempt to dupe the media, and it might have worked if not for the video evidence of what actually happened.</p>
<p>Such blatant misrepresentation of facts is common in police reports, especially where police misconduct is a factor. When Los Angeles police infamously brutalized Rodney King in 1991, they wrote reports claiming he had suffered only minor cuts and scrapes. In 2020, when police shot and killed an innocent Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, officers were charged with fabricating evidence to justify a “no knock” warrant and conspiring to cover up the truth.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n Canada,</span> police departments have been known to jump to the defence of officers who shoot suspects—before independent investigations have even begun. Perhaps the most famous example was the shooting of Indigenous leader J.&thinsp;J. Harper in Winnipeg in 1988. Harper was misidentified as a suspect in a crime, confronted by police officer Robert Cross, and then shot to death. Within two days, Winnipeg’s police chief exonerated Cross, blamed Harper for the events, and declared racism was not a factor in what happened. But Winnipeg’s Indigenous community was outraged, and the case was soon investigated intensively by Manitoba’s Aboriginal Justice Inquiry.</p>
<p>It concluded that Harper’s detention was inappropriate, that Cross had altered his story, and that an “official version” was concocted by police to mask what had really happened. The inquiry concluded it was Cross, through his unnecessary approach and inappropriate attempt to detain Harper, who set in motion the events that resulted in Harper’s death. It also said racism played a part in what happened. More broadly, the inquiry concluded that the Harper killing was just one example of a wider problem. “The justice system has failed Manitoba’s Aboriginal people on a massive scale.” </p>
<p>Thomas Nolan, a former Boston police lieutenant who became an academic, says he used to coach officers on how to frame their reports to paint victims as aggressors and themselves as valiant defenders of the law. Police routinely use contrived forms of expression when communicating with the media. They might describe “a male suspect exiting his vehicle” or a car that is “blue in colour.” But when describing serious matters, they have invented legalistic-sounding euphemisms like “officer-involved shooting” and “police interaction,” designed to obscure the truth. According to police press releases, officers never shoot people. At the most, they might “discharge their weapons,” which then strike individuals. Nolan says this is a deliberate strategy:</p>
<blockquote><p>This stilted, imprecise “legalese” is the commonly used verbiage found in the police lexicon and forms the base of the narrative that police use throughout the United States. The purpose of the narrative is ultimately to exculpate the police from any blame or allegation that the use of force being described was unnecessary, inappropriate, excessive, or unlawful. </p></blockquote>
<p>I cringe whenever I hear or read these manufactured phrases pop up in media reports, as they frequently do. It’s a signal the reporter is being manipulated. If police have shot and killed someone, it’s pure doublespeak to refer to the incident as an “interaction.”</p>
<p>Deception and lying aren’t just restricted to communication with the media. They often continue into the courts. In 2012, <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/police-who-lie-how-officers-thwart-justice-with-false-testimony/article_668c2250-73c0-5b12-8a3a-23446baad641.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an investigation by the <em>Toronto Star</em></a> found more than 100 cases across Canada where police used illegal techniques, excessive force, and racial profiling and then covered it up with false testimony in court. The newspaper found that a common technique would be for police to assault a suspect and then begin their cover-up by charging their victim with assault and obstructing justice. In reviewing court transcripts of cases where police lied, the <em>Star</em> made note of words judges used to describe their evidence: “lie,” “fabricate,” “evasive,” “absurd,” “ridiculous,” “subversive,” “disturbing,” and “pure fiction.” </p>
<p>The <em>Star</em> also noted that many officers who were accused of lying by judges never faced any consequences. Some were identified as repeat offenders. In many cases, the lying wasn’t reported to the internal discipline divisions of police departments, while other police forces seemed unconcerned by the findings. A spokesperson for the Toronto police told the newspaper its investigation couldn’t be taken seriously since many of the judicial statements were “throwaway comments” of little value. “A judge can comment on anything he or she wishes. Such comment, however, does not amount to a finding of guilt,” the spokesperson said. “The criminal justice system works on evidence, on examination, cross-examination, and decision. It does not work on throwaway comments unsupported by evidence.” </p>
<p>Systematic lying in court is so common in the United States that officers have coined a term for it: testilying. A New York mayoral commission investigating police in the mid-1990s found that officers often perjured themselves on the witness stand. “Perjury is perhaps the most widespread form of police wrongdoing facing today’s criminal justice system,” the report said.</p>
<p>A quarter of a century later, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/nyregion/testilying-police-perjury-new-york.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the <em>New York Times</em> revisited the issue</a> to see if anything had changed. It found lying in court was a recurring problem. Similarly, a <em><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2019/04/24/usa-today-revealing-misconduct-records-police-cops/3223984002/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">USA Today</a></em> investigation in 2019 collated police misconduct records over ten years. It found 2,227 instances of perjury, tampering with evidence or witnesses, or falsifying reports. </p>
<p>For people who work in the criminal justice system, the findings of these media investigations do not come as a great surprise. Toronto criminal lawyer Reid Rusonik <a href="https://www.thestar.com/opinion/canadians-have-a-right-to-expect-police-to-tell-the-truth-all-the-time/article_6c77c860-32b0-5d92-9896-bef2c66a9894.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">took to the pages of the <em>Toronto Star</em></a> in 2012 to give his perspective: “As a young criminal defence lawyer, I was taught that I must approach every case with the assumption that all police officers lie all of the time. I was taught that to analyze their anticipated evidence from any other starting point would be gross negligence.” </p>
<p>Some of those fabrications, he wrote, weren’t just “borne out of the existence of contradictory evidence from another human being whose credibility was also in issue. I am referring to lies in the face of completely independent evidence: audio and videotapes, computer records, the laws of physics, and notes made by the officers themselves.” </p>
<p>Academics have found that lying is woven into the fabric of police culture. Arresting officers realize they can lie to secure confessions. Senior officers know they can exaggerate to lobby for bigger budgets. For some, a form of “noble cause corruption” is at play&mdash;a sense that any means will justify the ends of securing social order and making sure the bad guys go to jail.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n their efforts</span> to manipulate reality, police rely primarily on the media to convey their messages to the public. Sociologist Richard Ericson identified two types of reporters who typically cover the police beat: the inner circle and the outer circle. </p>
<p>Inner-circle reporters usually come from outlets that rely heavily on crime news to fill their pages and news lineups. These would include radio reporters who have little time for anything other than the briefest reports and rarely venture beyond spot news. But it would also include beat reporters for major newsrooms who depend on good relations with police to be kept in the know. Many police departments in big cities provide office space for journalists right inside the station. The inner-circle reporters often spend the bulk of their working day there and tell their assignment editors what the breaking news stories are. In effect, the police are able to define the news agenda for these reporters. “The repertoire of inner-circle reporters rarely included explanations or secondary understanding,” Ericson writes. </p>
<p>When not covering breaking crime news, inner-circle reporters produce features that typically show police in a positive light. They focus on the life of officers and how they do their jobs, along with the tools and techniques they use. Such reporters are frequently rewarded with scoops. They are the first to be notified about a drug bust or a significant investigation. They might be invited on a ride along when police intend to make an arrest. Police departments in many places arrange “perp walks,” which involve tipping off friendly reporters or photographers to a location where officers will parade a suspect in handcuffs down the street. This serves two purposes: to reward reporters with an exclusive, behind-the-scenes view of an arrest in action and to embarrass a suspect they don’t like for one reason or another.</p>
<p>Outer-circle reporters, on the other hand, detach themselves from police sources and have more of a mission to “police the police” rather than to co-operate with them, according to Ericson. This often leads to conflict between police and reporters. I spent much of my career operating in this outer circle, as a reporter and manager. While other reporters might get exclusives about police busts, I put greater value on having my newsroom look critically at the policies and actions of officers. It often led to tense moments, with police departments refusing to provide information on critical issues.</p>
<p>Police also attempt to entirely eliminate media reporting of certain crimes. Decades ago, in Winnipeg, if the police didn’t want media scrutiny of a particular case, they would ensure the accused appeared before a judge in a suburban courtroom where reporters rarely ventured.</p>
<p>An interesting example of a clumsy cover-up by both police and a Crown prosecutor occurred early in my career. One day, I was walking through the ornate halls of Winnipeg’s law courts building when a waving hand appeared from behind a door. A provincial court judge beckoned me into a room. “You will want to be in Courtroom 103 this afternoon at 2:00 p.m.,” he said. I didn’t need any further encouragement. I came to the courtroom and patiently waited as a series of accused appeared before a judge for sentencing.</p>
<p>Finally, a forty-eight-year-old man pleaded guilty to a hit-and-run incident. He was driving carelessly and hit another vehicle, injuring two people. Then he left the scene of the accident. The Crown attorney recited the facts of the case briefly, and both he and the man’s defence counsel jointly recommended a light sentence. </p>
<p>Provincial court judge John Enns paused for a moment and then admonished both lawyers for “studiously avoiding” mentioning that the accused was a Winnipeg police officer. “You should know better,” he scolded them. It was a telling example of how police use their influence to mislead and cover things up, with complicity from the Crown. In this case, though, a judge refused to play ball. </p>
<p>The following year, an internal city report not meant for public distribution showed how police routinely hid the occupation of police officers who had been charged with criminal offences.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">palpable shift</span> in the public’s attitude toward police took place after George Floyd’s murder. The incident sparked massive demonstrations in the United States and many other parts of the world. In Canada, a series of deaths following police “wellness checks” on people in racialized communities contributed to the mounting anger against law enforcement. “Defund the Police” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement and other activists, and the media began intensively scrutinizing police budgets and practices. <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-the-untold-story-of-how-police-spending-was-once-on-a-tear-and-isnt/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A <em>Globe and Mail</em> analysis</a> found that police budgets had escalated rapidly in recent years. Between 2009 and 2018, for instance, budgets grew by 66 percent in Alberta. In Ontario, the growth was 34 percent, compared to a 24 percent increase in social and family services and an 8 percent decline in spending on social housing. Some cities spent a significant portion of their total municipal budgets on policing. In Longueuil, Quebec, spending on police amounted to 29.8 percent of the entire city budget, while in Winnipeg, it was 26.8 percent.</p>
<p>The movement to defund police in the United States scored some initial successes. In budget votes throughout 2020, advocacy groups lobbied for and won cuts of $840 million in more than twenty police departments, with some of that money redirected to community services. Some cities, like Denver and Oakland, decided to eliminate police officers from schools.</p>
<p>Police departments everywhere faced an existential crisis. They were encountering criticism and increased pressure at every turn. One of their key strategies in response to this problem was to figure out how to get the media and the public back onside. Some insight into this strategy emerged in an online webinar organized at the end of 2020 by ShotSpotter, a US company that sells technology to police departments. The target audience for the webinar was police chiefs and public information officers (PIOs) for departments. The title of the webinar was: “Best Practices for Media Relations in a Time of Defund the Police,” and among the topics covered were “strategies to avoid landmines and change the narrative, and how to leverage social media and data to get the public on your side.”</p>
<p>Ron Teachman of ShotSpotter set the table for the conversation: “It’s likely that no police agency will be spared from having insufficient resources, unrealistic demands and expectations of service placed on them, and subsequent scrutiny of their performance, particularly from the media.” All this, he said, when “there is civil unrest in our streets and rapidly escalating violent crime.”</p>
<p>The two speakers, representing police departments in New Jersey and Virginia, echoed his concern. But they also offered potential solutions. Reach out to victims of crime, one suggested, and get them to speak publicly about the excellent job police are doing. “Share positive stories from your community validators, let them sell it. In today’s landscape every positive story needs to be amplified.” One speaker talked about a police force in New Jersey that was hit with massive layoffs in 2011 and had to rebuild itself. “The main driver for re-establishing credibility was the media,” he said.</p>
<p>In the end, it was good old-fashioned public relations and brand management that were presented as the key to surviving the crisis. For Toronto police, one recent solution was spending more than $300,000 to produce its own podcast to give people a “behind the scenes” look at policing. As one of the webinar experts noted, “If you’re not using your PIO as your brand ambassador, your corporate reputation risk manager, then you’re running in some pretty dangerous territory. The way you look, your interactions with the community, everything has to be thought about in a marketing and a trust-building fashion.” </p>

<p><em>When Lawrence Hill published this essay eighteen years ago, could he have known how long it would keep its contemporary aura? Today, we often hear justifiable critiques of those limited ways Africa surfaces in the global imagination. But it’s critical that the diasporic desire for more positive points of identification not turn into ambivalence toward unphotogenic crises. Among other forms of paralysis, Hill’s essay criticizes indifference among African American political leaders amid the Rwandan genocide of 1994. As of this writing, the war in Sudan has left Khartoum’s morgues at their breaking point; a coup in Niger has further destabilized an already-beleaguered Sahel region; and terrorist groups are spilling into coastal West Africa. Progress </em>has<em> been made in Zimbabwe, which has significantly reduced the number of new HIV infections. But the Black North American indifference toward atrocities in Africa&mdash;conflicts directly related to the aftermath of colonialism&mdash;cannot afford to continue. Hill lays bare the reasons.—Connor Garel, Justice Fund writer in residence, November 2023 issue</em></p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n the 1970s,</span> as a teenager, I took a solo trip from my home in Toronto to visit family in Washington, DC, and foolishly asked my grandmother, May Edwards Hill, what she thought of the Black operatic characters Porgy and Bess. May, born in 1896 and raised in a prosperous family that fitted proudly into the ranks of what was then called “the talented tenth”&mdash;America’s elite, university-educated Blacks&mdash;tore a strip off me for even mentioning the characters popularized in the 1935 folk opera by George Gershwin, a white composer. The disabled Porgy, who wheeled himself about on a cart, and Bess, an unfaithful lover, were lowbrow Southern Blacks who, despite poverty and suffering, loved each other and lived with gusto and passion. Even as fictional characters, they nauseated my grandmother.</p>
<p>“We have enough stereotypes to combat as it is,” May muttered, “and they just bring shame down on all Negroes with their cavorting around and their immorality.” Her complaint reflected one of the most troubling paradoxes about Black identity in North America. For 400 years, we’ve been seen to be less than human. And so, to compensate, we must be more civilized than the civilized. We place unreasonable expectations on ourselves, such is our desire to succeed in the world and to be accepted as equal to those who dragged us across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>I should have known better than to put that question to May. I was familiar with the way Black communities sometimes slap down writers&mdash;especially strong Black feminists&mdash;whose characters “discredit the race.” Zora Neale Hurston’s 1937 novel, <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em>, a wild celebration of a free-spirited Black woman who takes up with another man without bothering to divorce her husband, was lambasted by Richard Wright, the major US Black novelist of the time, for offering “no theme, no message, no thought.” Alice Walker infuriated some with her depiction of a Black male character as a brutal, incestuous rapist in her bestselling novel <em>The Color Purple</em>. Black artists are to be morally upright standard-bearers for the young men and women who need to be shepherded toward responsible adulthood, and their fictional creations had better stay in line too.</p>
<p>By the age of ten, I was well versed in Black history and entranced by accounts of how my white mother, a civil rights activist, and Black father, a graduate student, had formed a union against all odds, married in the American South in 1953, and decamped that very week to spend the rest of their active lives fighting for human rights in Canada. Dad’s own father and grandfather had combined their work as ministers in the African Methodist Episcopal church, disseminating the social gospel in the Black communities they served. Stories had filtered down the generations about my great-great-grandfather purchasing freedom for his wife, his children, and himself in Maryland in 1860. “How did he get the money?” We speculated about it at the kitchen table. “Probably stole it,” came one response, with a cackle. But when the laughter subsided, we were quietly warned: “If you don’t fight racism, you become part of the problem.”</p>
<p>Stories abounded in my family about W.&thinsp;E.&thinsp;B. Du Bois, whose essay collection <em>The Souls of Black Folk</em> stands out as one of the seminal works of African American literature of the twentieth century. Born in 1868, Du Bois became the first Black to obtain a PhD from Harvard University and lived to the age of ninety-five. In 1900, he coined a phrase that spread like wildfıre and became a mantra among observers of race relations in America: “The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line.” And in September 1903, he published “The Talented Tenth,” one of his most famous essays, in which he argued that only the elite of the African American population could pull the rest of the Black population up by its bootstraps, and that education would save the Black people of America.</p>
<p>“Was there ever a nation on God’s fair earth civilized from the bottom upward?” he wrote. “Never; it is, ever was and ever will be from the top downward that culture filters. The Talented Tenth rises and pulls all that are worth the saving up to their vantage ground.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="smallcaps">or people like me,</span> being Black and having access to a good education carried certain obligations. It wasn’t good enough to get “A”s in school&mdash;you also had to ball up your fists and charge into battle if anybody used the word “nigger.” In the workplace, it wasn’t good enough to merely succeed professionally. You had to change the world too.</p>
<p>So what happened to this forward-looking, educated, socially engaged Black middle class? They were a powerful force for social change, leaders and supporters of civil rights movements, eloquent speakers and writers for the plight of North American Blacks&mdash;and for Africa itself. Africa needs them now, but are they interested in Africa?</p>
<p>This question arose in my mind last year when news broke about genocide in Sudan. It had also troubled me a decade earlier, when we learned about genocide in Rwanda. In her 2002 Pulitzer Prize–winning book, “<em>A Problem from Hell”: America and the Age of Genocide</em>, Samantha Power notes that no African American political leaders staged demonstrations or held hunger strikes while 800,000 people were killed over a hundred days in the Rwandan genocide. “No significant Rwandan diaspora lived in the United States; few African-Americans identify specific ancestral homelands and lobby on their behalf the way Armenians, Jews, or Albanians might,” Power wrote. Ironically, while North American Blacks were applauding the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa in 1994, Rwandans were being butchered in the worst genocide since the Holocaust. We, along with the rest of the world, stood by and let it happen.</p>
<p>Global indifference to the Rwandan massacre and to ongoing African atrocities has been much studied. But let’s not forget Blacks in the diaspora, by which I mean peoples around the world who are of African heritage and who feel connected to each other and share a sense of kinship with the continent. From us, one might expect dedicated action. Instead, from the vast majority, there has been a haunting silence not unlike that of people who stand implicated, yet immobile, at the cemetery gate.</p>
<p>I am about to embrace, with some reluctance, the very paradox that deserves incineration&mdash;that obligation to out-civilize the civilized. In so doing, I place an unfair moral burden on the shoulders of African Americans and African Canadians. But what else is there to do? To whom else can we turn?</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smallcaps">ver the centuries,</span> there have been many examples of Blacks on this continent reconnecting with Africa. In 1792, some 1,200 Black United Empire Loyalists became so disgusted with their ill treatment in Nova Scotia that they sailed from Halifax to create a colony in Sierra Leone. In 1824, emancipated American slaves sailed to Africa and founded Liberia. Shortly after creating the Universal Negro Improvement Association in 1914, Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican, was leading a massive Black organization with hundreds of chapters in the US, Canada, and across the world. Garvey urged Blacks in the Americas to embrace a “back to Africa” movement and argued in favour of founding a Black nation in Africa. The son of a stonemason, Garvey left school at the age of fourteen, and his populist movement celebrated Black pride. He couldn’t have differed more from Du Bois, but both men exuded passion about Africa.</p>
<p>Du Bois, who helped found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and spent forty years organizing Pan-African Congresses, led the way in bridging Africa and America. “The mystic spell of Africa is and ever was over all America. It has guided her hardest work, inspired her finest literature, and sung her sweetest songs,” he wrote in his 1962 biography of the American abolitionist John Brown. For Du Bois, social progress for Blacks in America went hand in hand with the liberation and development of African countries. After earlier trips to Africa, he finally moved to Ghana in 1961, at the age of ninety-three. He died there on August 27, 1963, the day before the famous civil rights march on Washington, DC.</p>
<p>Blacks in America hit the peak of their civil rights activism in the 1960s, at the very time that African nations were winning their independence from British, French, and other European colonial powers. It was no accident of history. For many, independence in Africa rode the same wavelength as the civil rights movement in the US. “The similarities in the political and psychological urgings of Black America and pre-independence Africa were real and profound,” Howard Jeter, a former US ambassador to Nigeria, has noted. “Africans and Black Americans, knowing that they were equal to any other human being, sought to be treated as human beings.”</p>
<p>In 1974, when Muhammad Ali took his heavyweight boxing championship fight with George Foreman to Zaire, he electrified Blacks around the world. Two years later, the African American author Alex Haley published <em>Roots: The Saga of an American Family</em>, a multigenerational novel reaching back to the birth in 1750 of an African named Kunta Kinte and to his kidnapping and subsequent enslavement in America. The book was translated into twenty-six languages, sold millions of copies, and was made into a major television miniseries, and African Americans responded enthusiastically to the fictionalized genealogy. <em>Roots</em> met with such commercial success because it offered a personal link between a Black American family and their African ancestors&mdash;a connection now so theoretical and tenuous that it has become almost mythical for most Blacks.</p>
<p>These days, the members of the diaspora resemble the detached and cooling embers of a dying fire. A few artists and academics celebrate Africa, but for the most part, the rest of us look away. Africans survived the Atlantic slave trade, the carving up and colonization of their continent, and the transition to political independence, but they now face cataclysmic threats to which we, in North America, remain indifferent.</p>
<p>Collectively, Blacks failed to exert the political pressure necessary to force the global powers to intervene and prevent the devastating civil wars in the West African countries of Sierra Leone and Liberia. We also looked away from the murderous civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We have remained largely mute about the current genocide in Sudan.</p>
<p>Blacks and others in North America did rally in defence of the Black majority of South Africa under apartheid rule. Somehow, it was easier to generate widespread opposition to the South African regime because the targets of our ire were the minority white rulers of the country. In that clear-cut moral issue, we pinpointed the enemy efficiently. But why hasn’t the greatest ongoing crisis Africa has ever faced&mdash;the HIV/AIDS pandemic&mdash;drawn the same support? And why no action against the murderers in Rwanda, the DRC, or Sudan? Do these examples of Black-on-Black violence cut too close to the bone?</p>
<p>Few North American Blacks now relate to the homeland. Presented with a map of Africa, most cannot even point out Lagos, Ouagadougou, Khartoum, or Cape Town. Geographic ignorance is like the tip of an iceberg, hinting at a much deeper void in our collective psyche about Africa and its peoples. For some of us, it hurts too much to think about Africa. The irony of this becomes almost unbearable when you travel in Africa and meet schoolchildren who recite all sorts of information about Canada and America. Once, while travelling in Cameroon, I met a young man who waxed enthusiastic about the various Canadian cities he had heard about: “How I long to visit the wonderful metropolitan centres of Calgary, Toronto, Montreal, Quebec, and Joliette,” he said, clapping his hands together. Joliette?</p>
<p>This embrace of a far-off continent and all its promises is not reciprocated by North American Blacks. Indeed, we identify less and less with Africa, and our battles here at home take our attention away from a threatened people whom we don’t even know. Africa is too distant, too big, too confusing, <em>too much</em>. Second only to Asia in size, Africa has fifty-three countries, nearly 1 billion people, over 1,000 languages, and a diversity of cultures and religions. How to connect with that when there is no firm point of connection, save the knowledge that one or more of your ancestors was stolen from some unknown village in an unknown and unfamiliar land?</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he world’s worst</span> humanitarian crisis is unfolding before our eyes, and its crucible lies in Africa. The United Nations estimates that 25 million Africans are living with HIV/AIDS; 1.9 million of them are under the age of fifteen&mdash;90 percent of the infected children in the world. The outlook for them is grim. In 2003, 2.2 million people died of AIDS-related illness in sub-Saharan Africa, representing over three-quarters of the worldwide total and 16 percent more than the year before. North American Blacks are reacting to this catastrophe like tense drivers in rush hour, refusing to make eye contact with the desperate person five metres away who wants to slip into their lane. <em>I’m not letting you in. I’m not even going to recognize your existence</em>.</p>
<p>Stephen Lewis, the UN special envoy on HIV/AIDS in Africa, has often sounded the alarm bell. “The pandemic is overshadowing anything we know in human history,” he told members of the Canadian parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and international trade. “People now talk about a hundred million deaths down the road. I don’t doubt that for a moment.”</p>
<p>I asked Lewis to comment on African American leadership in addressing the AIDS pandemic in Africa. He tiptoed, noting that through their churches and their wallets, many African Americans have funnelled assistance to Africa in its time of crisis. And he acknowledged that groups such as the Congressional Black Caucus&mdash;an advocacy group comprising African Americans in both parties in the US House of Representatives&mdash;have consistently lobbied for greater government funding to address AIDS internationally. Nonetheless, he noted, “In terms of the pandemic, it is somewhat curious that the African-American leadership in the United States has been so slow to rally.”</p>
<p>Curious, indeed. Some might call it shameful. Where are the marches? The demonstrations? Where is the unstoppable will that desegregated America, demanded that US troops withdraw from Vietnam, and defied the apartheid regime of South Africa?</p>
<p>AIDS, even more than genocide and famine, involves a devastating destruction of humanity and features an elusive enemy—a virus emboldened by poverty. It’s the ultimate litmus test for a diaspora, and Blacks are failing. Badly. I wanted to know why, so I started an inquiry within my family, interviewing Black American relatives who had been reared on the same values of social obligation that my parents espoused. My cousin, Marie Metoyer, a retired psychiatrist living in Manchester, New Hampshire, seemed like a good pick because she and her mother, Lena Edwards Madison, spent their best years providing medical services in their own communities. “You were to achieve, excel, integrate into the white community, and that, with education, was to be your salvation,” she said. And Africa? “Ideally,” Metoyer said, “there is an onus on African-Americans to take an active role for humanitarian reasons in Africa. Unfortunately, some of us are so involved in our own spheres and interests that we don’t see Africa as a priority.”</p>
<p>Another relative&mdash;Adele Flateau, fifty-three, who has spent twenty-five years in community service and now works at a clinic for HIV/AIDS patients in Brooklyn&mdash;had a similar message when I asked her what had happened to the activism of the sixties.</p>
<p>“I think we didn’t pass on the torch to our next generation, and those of us that were in the forefront back twenty or thirty years have kind of fizzled out. We have a lot more Black elected officials now, but they just don’t seem to be very outspoken. In fact, they’ve been very silent. There is an eerie kind of silence among most of the Black leadership now.”</p>
<p>Outside the clinic where Adele works, a taxi driver&mdash;a thin, middle-aged Black man who gave his name as Jacob&mdash;wanted to know all about the article I was writing. He showed a lively knowledge of Africa and was quick to offer an opinion: “Sure, you will meet some Black community leaders who care about the AIDS crisis in Africa. But most of us? Forget it. It’s like, I’ve got my rent to pay and The Man is leaning on me left, right, and centre, and I’m trying to get my kids through school without being shot at, so don’t talk to me about Africa. I’m American. Talk to me about America, and about the damn leak in my roof.”</p>
<p>His attitude is familiar to Charles Barron. Barron, a former member of the Black Panthers, emerged as one of America’s most radical Black politicians after the people of Brooklyn elected him to the New York City Council in 2001. Barron argues that diminished identification with Africa prevents Blacks from stepping up to the plate.</p>
<p>“If you do something to a Jewish person in Israel, Jewish people who were never born in Israel, born in America, will scream. If you do something to a Chinese person in China, the Chinese in Chinatown will holler. Or if something happens to Korea, the Korean people in America will holler,” he says. “But we don’t have that kind of identification with Africa.”</p>
<p>Salih Booker, executive director of Africa Action, a pro-Africa lobby group based in Washington, DC, notes that young African Americans show an interest in the continent but know very little about it. “All Americans are by and large ignorant of Africa, and that’s true whether you’re African American or white American,” Booker told me. “Most Americans and most African Americans just don’t have opportunities to study or travel or learn much about Africa, and therefore they’re inundated mainly with negative imagery—Africa starving, Africa at war, genocide, those sorts of things&mdash;which creates a mental barrier. Often some folks don’t want to identify with Africa because these are the only images they have.”</p>
<p>When I asked Bill Fletcher, Jr., president of TransAfrica Forum&mdash;another Washington-based activist organization interested in American policies affecting Africa and other countries in the diaspora&mdash;how effectively African Americans were pressuring their government to respond more meaningfully to African crises, he was blunt.</p>
<p>“I think that people dropped the ball, but I think part of it, frankly, within Black America is what could only be called embarrassment,” he said. “When we look at Africans, we also look at Africa as a continent of Black people, so why are they fighting each other, why are they killing each other?” Fletcher tied Africa’s current troubles to historical factors such as the way in which the continent was arbitrarily carved up into countries to suit the interests of European colonial powers. Knowledge of the legacy of French colonialism would lead to a fuller understanding of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Fletcher said, “but many people just look at it and say, ‘My God, I don’t even want to think about it.’”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t must be</span> acknowledged that some African Americans are still fighting for Africa. For example, the Congressional Black Caucus, particularly Democratic congresswoman Barbara Lee from California, and Africa Action, the advocacy group led by Booker, have consistently lobbied the Bush administration to increase funding for AIDS intervention in Africa. Booker, who assembled a coalition of thirty Black American religious leaders to advance Africa Action’s lobbying efforts, told me: “One out of eight Americans is directly of African descent. This is a country of African descent as much as it is a country of European and other descent.”</p>
<p>“Then there is the modern self-interest,” Booker said. “The world is a very small place, and we have a vested interest in things like defeating the global AIDS pandemic because it is a threat to international security, stability, and economic progress, and it happens to be concentrated in Africa right now.”</p>
<p>Strong advocates like Booker also support a full cancellation of debts owed by African countries to the International Monetary Fund and to the World Bank, in part so that African nations can attain the financial breathing room necessary to address the AIDS pandemic themselves. They accuse the Bush administration of blocking access in Africa to cheaper, generic drugs for anti-retroviral treatment for AIDS patients and demand that the road be cleared.</p>
<p>On top of lobbying efforts, there are small groups and individuals carrying out heroic work in Africa. Of all the people I interviewed, I was most moved by the courage and conviction of two African American women who have dedicated their lives to the fight against AIDS in Africa. Neither is famous. Neither is a national figure in the US.</p>
<p>Pernessa Seele is the indefatigable leader of the Balm in Gilead, a Black American not-for-profit, non-governmental organization that aims to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS throughout the African diaspora. The Balm in Gilead works with some 15,000 churches to provide education and support to people affected by the disease in the US and Africa. With eighteen employees, the organization devotes about half of its $3 million annual budget to addressing the AIDS pandemic in five African countries&mdash;Ivory Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Seele, who grew up in a segregated town in South Carolina, says that although some African American organizations have pressured the American government to direct more resources toward the fight, there is a huge void on the political front. “Presently, I think we’re failing terribly. I don’t think that the African American community is really mobilizing and pushing for anything politically at this time. We are politically dead. Where is the fire of the sixties? The fire of the sixties is out. Folks have moved on.”</p>
<p>For a time, Seele suggests, Black Americans lost themselves in materialistic obsessions, remained in denial about AIDS, and simply couldn’t feel the “intense infusion of pain” that AIDS victims and their families know all too well.</p>
<p>More recently, Seele notes, Black churches have been addressing the crisis. “Clearly, after [twenty-four] years with this epidemic raging, nobody is coming to save us but us.” In fact, she says, the AIDS pandemic now offers a way for Black Americans to reconnect to Africa.</p>
<p>One of Seele’s sisters-in-arms in the war on AIDS is Melva Black, a social worker born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee. Black had never travelled to Africa until her church, the Metropolitan Interdenominational Church, decided to carry its extensive AIDS service programs across the ocean. In 2000, Black’s pastor, Reverend Edwin C. Sanders II, attended the UN AIDS conference in Durban, South Africa. There, he met a woman who ran an underfunded orphanage in which seventy children, who had HIV/AIDS or were orphans of AIDS victims, lived in a building with two bedrooms and one bathroom. The orphanage was facing increasing financial difficulties and had to come up with $20,000 (US) to buy the land on which it was situated. Reverend Sanders promised to ask his approximately 700-member congregation to look into resolving that difficulty. Less than a year later, the Nashville church had raised the $20,000. They then sent a delegation&mdash;including Melva Black&mdash;back to the community of Waterfall, on the outskirts of Durban, with the money to purchase the land for the Agape Child Care Center.</p>
<p>For Black, much has happened since then. In the past few years, she has travelled numerous times to Africa. She doesn’t travel alone. She brings Americans from various churches on twice-yearly trips and helps connect them to other orphanages and schools in need of assistance.</p>
<p>Seele and Black are angels on earth. But their work&mdash;and the efforts of Africa Action and other lobby groups&mdash;is like drops of water in a tidal wave of North American indifference and, within the Black community, they are exceptions that prove the rule.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="smallcaps">o far,</span> no one has proven capable of exciting public sentiment or pushing governments to substantial action. Africa barely registered in last year’s elections in Canada and the US. Societies are collapsing while we in North America watch (or don’t watch) with hands folded, sitting quietly like church mice.</p>
<p>With racism and inequality cluttering our own backyards, it isn’t fair to ask Blacks to tackle the problems of Africa. But the AIDS pandemic isn’t fair either. So, as my grandmother might have argued, we have to demand heroism from Blacks anyway.</p>
<p>We insist that our children enjoy the benefits of the civil rights advances made by our parents and grandparents. Yet our vision is too continental. We dare not glance across the ocean, preferring not to think about the daily fate of children, women, and men in Africa. Our ancestors stumbled off the boats and survived against all odds, and we’re sure as hell not looking back now.</p>
<p>Even with various trips to Africa and friendships with Africans, I have not taken up the challenge of responding fully in Africa’s time of greatest need. My own children know less of Africa than I did of the civil rights movement when I was their age. This cannot continue. When I was ten years old, I asked my father at what point I would become responsible for solving problems in the world. He looked at me tenderly and said, “As soon as you become aware of the problems, they become yours too.” We are aware of the problem, and we must do something, or no one will follow us.</p>
<p>Stephen Lewis argues that Canadians could choose one African nation ravaged by AIDS and devote massive resources, expertise, and medications to help turn the tide of the disease there, to show the world what can be done. He’s right. To date, however, we have done next to nothing. Like others on this continent, African Americans and African Canadians have chosen to ignore Africa.</p>
<p>We must fill the deep void in our collective psyche regarding Africa. This wound, this emptiness, prevents us from being whole. May Edwards Hill shrank decades ago from the stereotype of the promiscuous Porgy and Bess, but today we must stop cringing at the sight of African famines, civil wars, genocide, and corruption. Historical wrongs, accidents, misfortunes, and misdeeds present only one aspect of Africa. Remember the undeniable humanity of nearly 1 billion individuals on the continent, each with a beating heart, aspirations, and an inherent right to live with dignity. And remember that African peoples have permeated, influenced, and enriched virtually every aspect of North American society. Part of our response to Africa must emanate from a renewed sense of pride in ourselves, connection to Africa and its peoples, and a rebirth within the diaspora.</p>
<p>It would be absurd to claim that a reinvigorated response to Africa must come solely from outside the continent or just from Blacks in the diaspora. But movements have to start somewhere, and Africa needs a credible, powerful, influential group to assume the sort of leadership that could galvanize millions of North Americans. Blacks in Canada and the US are more than capable. They could supply the leg that kicks North America into action.</p>
<p>In 1917, the US Central Committee of Negro College Men issued an urgent wartime call to arms. “The race is on trial,” they wrote. “It needs every one of its red-blooded, sober minded men.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;Up, brother, our race is calling.” I never dreamed I’d be invoking this same mantra more than eighty years after the end of the Great War. I never thought I’d be asking myself&mdash;or appealing to others&mdash;to ball up their fists and fight. The Great War was said to be the war to end all wars, but it didn’t turn out that way. The civil rights movement was supposed to guarantee dignity and freedom for all, but we never truly took the movement across the ocean to include the people of Africa. It appears that the greatest war to fight, as we wade, leaderless, into the opening chapter of the twenty-first century, will be settled by medicine, not bombs, by community service, not the maniacal pursuit of self-interest. Up, brothers and sisters, our race is calling. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/africas-pain/">Is Africa’s Pain Black America’s Burden?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

They’re here to celebrate my forty years in journalism. There’s the gang from <em>Domino</em> fashion magazine, where I got my start in the can’t-spend-enough, cocaine-stoked ’80s. The <em>Globe and Mail</em> crew, from the ambitious middle of my career, hang out with colleagues from <em>Maclean’s</em>, the <em>Toronto Star</em>, and <em>Metro</em>. (I moved around a lot.) The CBC News crowd are huddled to my left, protecting themselves and their fat budgets from the circling sharks of underfunded journalism. My final job was with them: we were together for the <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> shutdown, the murder of George Floyd, the storming of the Capitol in Washington, DC, the invasion of Ukraine, nuclear threats from Russia, and blazing forests and atmospheric rivers at home. It was the most punishing news cycle of my career. I wasn’t sad to be leaving.</p>
<p>Just beyond the guests and beyond the hornbeam trees where I’ve strung fairy lights for the party, I think I can see my future. The grind of work is finally over, my retirement dream cued up. April in Paris! Reading by the sea! Spanish lessons in Antigua so I can better speak to my grandson. I’ll be playing with him, too, in the open-ended days my children rarely knew with me. I’m not saying I deserve a life of ease. But I worked hard to earn my retirement, dropping giant chunks of my salary into company and government pension plans throughout those forty years. It’s time for the famous social contract to hold up its end of the bargain and take care of me, the way it did my father before me, to deliver on the idea that retirement is my right after a life of work and the promise that I will have the time and means to enjoy it. </p>

<p>Except none of that happened. The year since my retirement party has not been a dreamy passage to a welcoming future but a nerve-shattering trip into the unknown. My debt is swelling like a broken ankle; my hard-won savings may or may not be sucked into the vortex of an international market collapse. Can I keep my house? Who knows? The macroeconomy is messing with my microeconomy. The future keeps shape-shifting. And none of the careful planning I put into my retirement is going to change that. </p>
<p>When I left my last job, I felt sad for friends determined to keep working to seventy and beyond. How eccentric they seemed. Now I repeat the same two words whenever I see them: “Don’t retire.”</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="dropcap">R</span><span class="smallcaps">oughly a thousand people</span> are retiring each day in Canada, Fraser Stark, president of the Longevity Pension Fund at Purpose Investments in Toronto, told me. That’s about a million currently retired. Ours is the largest generation in Canadian history to move into retirement, and we tend to get distracted by the sheer number of us snailing through the system like a row of snowplows on a four-lane highway. But the bigger issue with retiring at sixty-four, which is the average age Canadians leave the workforce, can be summed up in one increasingly terrifying word: longevity. </p>
<p>Anyone retiring in Canada right now can expect to live at least until eighty (women until eighty-four). But those numbers are averaged out. When I began to discuss retirement with my financial planner in early 2022, he put my life expectancy at ninety-four. “Why, thank you,” I said, “I do try to keep fit.” “No,” said Benjamin Klein, senior portfolio manager at Baskin Wealth Management, “life expectancy is not randomized. When we factor in your gender, genetics, access to good health care, education, and lifestyle, that’s how long you’ll live.”</p>
<p>Stark doubled down on that number. The oldest Canadian is believed to have died at age 117. “If you want to accurately plan, that’s the number that you need to write down,” he said. Retire at sixty-four and you could have fifty more years to save for. </p>
<p>Every generation lives longer than the one that came before&mdash;nothing new there. But a fifty-year span between the end of work and the end of life is a long way from the original purpose of paid retirement, which was a very short bridge of financial support. Or no bridge at all. Otto von Bismarck has been trotted out and smacked down many times for his invention of paid retirement: in 1881, he proposed that all Germans had the right to government support after a life of work, with payments kicking in at age seventy. Except that life expectancy in the 1880s was about forty years. When Canada created its own pension plan, in 1965, to address the growing poverty of retired Canadians sixty-five and older&mdash;thank you, Lester B. Pearson, for my monthly CPP cheque&mdash;the life expectancy of men, who made up the bulk of the workforce, was sixty-eight.</p>
<p>By 2019, 37 percent of Canadians fifty-five and older were concerned they wouldn’t have enough savings when they retired, <a href="http://- Canada.ca https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/programs/research/canadian-financial-capability-survey-2019.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to</a> the Canadian Financial Capability Survey. And that was before the rush of retirements during COVID, a third of them earlier than planned. Lockdown’s low interest rates and curtailed spending gave false hope to retirees such as me&mdash;those unspending days when the money in my bank account seemed to self-spawn like guppies. And, also like guppies, its lifespan was short lived. </p>
<p>“There’s not enough gold in my golden years,” I told Klein a few months into my retirement. I could feel him smiling sympathetically across the phone line. “You’re not alone,” he assured me. Rents, mortgages, groceries&mdash;Canadians are suffering. I described the little house graphic on my gas bill: the house keeps getting smaller, thanks to my ferocious vigilance. But the bill keeps getting bigger, thanks to the cost of gas. And that’s just standard housekeeping. Throw in the unexpected, like a family wedding or grown kids moving back home, and many retired people land “somewhere on the spectrum of panic,” Klein said.</p>
<p class="pull-quote">The oldest Canadian is believed to have died at age 117. Retire at sixty-four and you could have fifty more years to save for.</p>
<p>According to BMO’s thirteenth <a href="https://newsroom.bmo.com/2023-02-07-BMO-Annual-Retirement-Study-Canadians-Believe-They-Need-1-7M-to-Retire-Up-20-Per-Cent-from-2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Annual Retirement Study</a> released this past February, Canadians believe they need $1.7 million to retire, up 20 percent from 2020, when they put it at $1.4 million. The number is not statistically supported, but it’s a good gauge of people’s emotional preparedness for retirement and how anxious they feel. That third of Canadians who were worried, in 2019, that they wouldn’t have enough money has jumped to more than half of us in 2023, and 74 percent are concerned about inflation and rising prices. </p>
<p>Fewer than a quarter of retiring Canadians have a defined benefit pension plan, Stark said. Instead, “many of us retire with a lump sum of money.” The amounts vary, but the massive uncertainty of how long the money will last doesn’t. “We don’t know how long we’re going to live; we don’t know what the interest rates will be; we don’t know what the stock markets will do; we don’t know what inflation rates are,” said Stark. “Every one of us when we retire is on a unique journey of insecurity.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">t&#8217;s not only</span> the retired who need to worry about supporting themselves in the long stretch of their future. Working generations coming up behind them will also shoulder this burden. A metric called the dependency ratio calculates the proportion of the people not in the workforce who are “dependent” on those of working age. According to Statistics Canada, dependents are aged zero to nineteen and sixty-five and over. Productives are twenty to sixty-four. The international tool is often cited by government and business and has been a driver of pension-reform debates around the world.</p>
<p>A low dependency ratio&mdash;in Mexico, for example&mdash;means that there are enough people working to support the dependent population. A high ratio&mdash;Japan and South Korea are at the top&mdash;indicates more financial stress on workers. Across all OECD countries right now, there are about thirty people sixty-five and over for every 100 people of working age. In 1950, that ratio was fourteen to 100; by 2075, it is predicted to increase to fifty-five non-working adults for every 100 working. </p>
<p>In Canada, we’re at the lower end, with dependency expected to hit about thirty-five by 2025, according to <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/pensions-at-a-glance-2015/old-age-dependency-ratio_pension_glance-2015-23-en;jsessionid=u7Q5drCgbYElgirFEUbcU5kQQhgkBcz_MWWQ4vhE.ip-10-240-5-146" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2015 data</a> from the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. But by 2075, our dependency ratio is projected to be 49.9&mdash;one dependent for every two working-age Canadians. That’s a big burden for Xs, Ms, and Zs. “The shrinking percentage of young people means that in the future, the number of workers may be insufficient to finance the pensions of retirees,” according to StatCan. </p>
<p>The original meaning of the word “retire,” from the French “retirer,” is the act of retreating, falling back, withdrawing into seclusion. Except the retirees I spoke to for this story had go-go schedules that I was worn out just hearing about. Many had taken on dramatically different types of paid employment after leaving their careers; others had unleashed their inner rebels to become tireless advocates for social justice and climate change; still others were full-time caregivers. </p>
<p>“The government pays very little” for retired Canadians, said Thomas Klassen, professor at York University’s School of Public Policy and Administration. Of the experts I spoke to about retirement, he was the only one of traditional retirement age, so you could say he had a stake in the debate, but I found him reliably dispassionate. He pointed out that retirees in new jobs pay income tax, taxes on their retirement income and government subsidies, HST and GST, and they contribute to the economy by spending money. “And yet we keep hearing that boomers are hoarding all the money and that we will bankrupt younger people,” he said.</p>
<p>Samir Sinha called the dependency ratio outdated and misguided. The director of geriatrics at Sinai Health and University Health Network in Toronto and a passionate defender of the rights of older Canadians argued that such concepts hold us back. “They don’t recognize the new reality that at sixty-five you’re likely to have twenty years” of good and productive life ahead. </p>
<p>The retired are among the country’s biggest contributors to child care and volunteer work, Sinha said. “Think about the amount governments save for the unpaid care that mostly older people are providing. When we’ve priced out the unpaid caregiver, we’re valuing that in the billions and billions of dollars every year.”</p>
<p>Mieko Ise might be called a “silent retiree”: someone who quietly leaves the workforce to look after family members in need. For years, she juggled looking after her own and her husband’s parents while working full time for a Toronto nonprofit. “I started to have issues with being a caregiver and a full-time employee,” said Ise, now in her sixties. “I would take vacation days. I would book time off. My boss was not particularly sympathetic. I get it. I don’t believe employers should carry the load of your life burden.” When it became too overwhelming to have two jobs, Ise quit the one we count as work. </p>

" width="1200" height="1320" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-159890" /></p>
<p>Sinha pointed me to a Japanese movie called <em>Plan 75</em>, directed by Chie Hayakawa and released in 2022. In a dystopian future, Japan&mdash;which in real life is the demographically oldest OECD country, with a projected dependency ratio of seventy-seven to 100 by 2075&mdash;offers $1,000 to the elderly to terminate their own lives and relieve society of the burden of supporting them. The movie, which I watched with my seventy-six-year-old sister (a lawyer who retired at seventy-two), opened with a violent murder off camera. We heard the blast of gunshot and saw a wheelchair toppled on its side. “Cheery beginning,” said Laura. (It turned out&mdash;spoiler&mdash;the real <em>Plan 75</em> was to sell the older generations’ ashes for profit to a recycling company. The message of the sweetly weird movie was it’s better not to kill our elders.)</p>
<p>The year before <em>Plan 75</em> came out, Yusuke Narita, an assistant professor of economics at Yale University, suggested mass suicide and disembowelment for Japan’s aged. “I feel like the only solution is pretty clear,” he said in a 2021 video. Narita later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/12/world/asia/japan-elderly-mass-suicide.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">softened his comment</a>s in response to questions from the <em>New York Times</em>, saying they were an “abstract metaphor” (disembowelment seems pretty visceral to me). But he did win a big audience: he now has more than 600,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<p>It’s true that the number of people over sixty-five is growing faster in countries across Asia than anywhere else in the world at the same time that the size of their younger generations shrinks. That means as many as half of Japan’s employers report shortages of full-time workers, according to <em>New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/07/world/asia/japan-workers-retirement.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reporting</a> from earlier this year on ageing in Asia. Workers in their seventies and even eighties are stepping up to fill the gap, taking lower-paying jobs as delivery drivers, office cleaners, and store clerks&mdash;jobs that the younger generations don’t want. A quarter of people sixty-five and over in Japan are currently working. </p>
<p>The number is the same in Canada and increasing: 24 percent of Canadians aged sixty-five to seventy still work in jobs that can be measured, up from 11 percent in 2000. But the dependency ratio reinforces the belief that those sixty-five and over are not working. Workers are not counted as workers because they’ve <em>aged out</em> of the way that we count them. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">“T</span><span class="smallcaps">he Greys”</span> is what the older generation working for <em>Succession</em>’s Waystar RoyCo were called. They were often shot bunched together like an endangered species. They put on compression socks before flying. They plotted for their golden parachutes. Or maybe “one last rodeo,” as Karl, Waystar’s CFO, suggested to Frank, former vice chairman, in the final minutes of the hit series. Cut to Tom, the brand new CEO: “Frank, dead. Karl, dead. I really don’t need those two old cunts on my shoulder.” </p>
<p>I thought it was funny as hell. Or I did before my conversation with Lisa Taylor, president of Challenge Factory and co-author of <em>The Talent Revolution: Longevity and the Future of Work</em>. Taylor described ageism as “the last socially acceptable form of prejudice.” She and her company have set 2030&mdash;the year the last of the boomers reach sixty-five&mdash;as the target for solving what she described as the far-reaching and urgent issue of this country’s age-biased workforce.</p>
<p>I was skeptical. Surely, there are more important workplace issues to solve, like equity and fairness for people of every race and gender. But after a couple of hours on the phone with Taylor, I came to believe that treating retirement as a default outcome of ageing is a workplace bias that will affect the life expectancy, financial dependency, and long-term care costs for a generation retiring earlier than it needs or wants to. Not to mention the impact on the economy. Taylor said if we want to take advantage of our full workforce&mdash;in 2022, Canada had <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410032501" rel="noopener" target="_blank">nearly a million job vacancies</a>&mdash;we need to get to a point where we “recognize and call out ageism with the same level of comfort as we do other prejudices in our workplaces.”</p>
<p class="pull-quote">Fewer than a quarter of retiring Canadians have a defined benefit pension plan. Instead, many of us retire with a lump sum of money.</p>
<p>Systemic ageism was meant to have been legislated out of the workplace in 2006, when the Ontario Human Rights Commission won the argument that Canadian workers don’t come with a best-before date stamped on their foreheads. (I was a manager at the <em>Globe and Mail</em> at the time, I was fifty-one, and there was a lot of backroom worry about carrying the Greys on our backs&mdash;and a lot of wisecracks about a superannuated newsroom.) But even though sixty-five hasn’t been the legal age for retirement for seventeen years, “we’re constantly looking for ways to push them out the door,” said Sinha&mdash;with retirement packages, buyouts, and pension contributions capped at sixty-five. </p>
<p>Taylor’s company did a workplace survey of the financial services industry in 2015, and it showed that as early as age forty-nine, workers were no longer sent for training or high-performance programs and future-focused career conversations had slowed down. By the time someone hit fifty-five, “the conversation about leaving had been going on for years, except no one was actually saying it.” </p>
<p>My own conversations with retired Canadians, particularly men in finance, bore this out. Raymond Betts worked most of his life in the frenetic world of institutional equity in New York, Boston, and Toronto. (Betts asked that his name be changed for this article.) When he turned fifty-three, the company hired a younger employee to do the same job as his, without discussing it with him. “My desk was originally thirty-six inches long; they kept moving me to a smaller desk until I ended up sitting at one that was twenty-four inches long.” Betts left that world at sixty, taking his skills and work ethic to his second career as a real estate agent. </p>
<p>Many people buy into the company storyline that their best years are behind them&mdash;the proverbial coasting into retirement. “People start to say, ‘Susan’s checked out. Susan retired a few years ago, she just hasn’t told us,’” said Taylor. “It’s attributed to age instead of the company’s mismanagement of talent.”</p>
<p>It’s not a big step from there to the accepted myths about older workers: they’re slower and less productive. They’re over the hill, so training them is a cost instead of an investment. Ditto spending any time performance-managing them. The stickiest myth is that the long-time employee is too expensive. “Get this senior person off the books and hire two younger people to replace them,” is how Sinha put it. I’ve been part of those conversations myself about retirement-age people; likely my bosses also had them about me. But seeing the older worker as a financial burden is a failure of math. </p>
<p>“Calculations of how much employees cost a company generally include salary and benefits packages,” said Taylor. However, their not having to learn on the job, be trained, or engage the resources of a mentor, let alone the asset of being used as a mentor for younger staff&mdash;all of this also saves costs. “I have the experience, the relationships, the contacts. I work incredibly hard,” said Betts. He still does: he’s sold 132 houses in the seven years since he turned sixty.</p>
<p>I mentioned to Taylor that some of the Greys at CBC News seemed to struggle with technology during COVID. She stopped me. “We give a pass to the twenty-three-year-old with cats walking back and forth on camera,” she said. But we snicker when someone over sixty leaves their mike off. I blamed imminent senility, especially when the person on mute was myself. </p>
<p class="pull-quote">Another problem with retirement: it could kill you. People who stop working too soon may not have much time to live before they die.</p>
<p>Taylor was unsurprised. “Ageism is also self-imposed,” she said. Her example was the joke birthday cards we send each other. “If you replaced age with any other characteristic, you would never send it,” she said. I don’t mention the card I just received for my sixty-eighth birthday, a New Yorker cartoon called “Senior Charades.” The old man’s word bubble says: “Two words&mdash;I forgot what they are.” It got a big laugh and led to various tips about how to behave at work to appear less old: Don’t groan when you stand up. Smile in meetings so your face doesn’t sag into resting-old-face. And never rummage for anything, especially glasses. (Actually, never say the word “rummage.”) </p>
<p>Taylor, who turned forty-nine this spring (and says she’s been losing her glasses since she was twenty-two), is a long way from retirement; so are most of the experts I spoke with. I found their dedication moving; they saw it as realistic. “Unlike other prejudices, 100 percent of people will feel age prejudice if we don’t solve it,” said Taylor. Klassen thinks it will take twenty years for the workplace to reflect the law. Sinha said we’re still in the “baby steps” of realizing that longevity has implications for how long we work. “The workplace has not caught up with the reality of life expectancy, and therefore of career expectancy,” he said. </p>
<p>Working longer because you’re likely to live longer is not everyone’s idea of how best to reform retirement. It’s an anathema in France, to give the most widely reported example. President Emmanuel Macron finally pushed through his pension reforms this past spring, increasing the retirement age from sixty-two to sixty-four over a seven-year period. In the often-violent street battles that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/france-protests-police-violence-5a2e01ed4fbcfeee6a3ac098db94339c" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fed headlines</a> everywhere, protesters lost a thumb, an eye, and even, to one officer’s club in Paris, a testicle. One of the many slogans from the protests stood out for me: “Leave us time to live before we die.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smallcaps">ut here&#8217;s</span> a more existential problem with retirement: it could kill you. People who stop working too soon may <em>not</em> have much time to live before they die. “You hear about the doctors whose entire life and identity was at the hospital,” said Sinha. Then they retire and “they’re dead a few months later.” Similar sudden-death stories circulate about a certain type of driven, lifelong journalist, and I always assumed they were apocryphal. Or that the victim had been ignoring long-standing health issues. </p>
<p>Shortened life expectancy can be predicted by a lack of purpose, Sinha said. He referred to a “meta-analysis” project from 2010 that combined research from 148 studies involving 308,849 people to show that social connection and purpose increased survival by 50 percent. A lack of social relationships created the same risk of death as well-established factors such as smoking, drinking, and obesity. It was a gobsmacking discovery thirteen years ago; a lot of subsequent research has since supported the finding that early retirement can mean less time to enjoy it.<br />
The Blue Zones research into the world’s longest-lived people, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/5-blue-zones-where-the-worlds-healthiest-people-live" rel="noopener" target="_blank">much publicized</a> by National Geographic and now a Netflix docuseries called <em>Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zone</em>, also links longevity with purpose. “In the island community of Okinawa”&mdash;in Japan, where very long-lived women thrive on a diet of sweet potatoes, mugwort, and goya&mdash;“everybody can tell you what their sense of purpose is,” said Sinha. “They have a word for it: ikigai, which means ‘reason for being.’”</p>
<p>Every society uses markers as shorthand for people to understand each other. “In some societies, it’s your last name or who your parents were,” said Taylor. “Americans use job titles, but they’re equally likely to identify each other by the city they grew up in, or what university they went to, or what sports team they’re a fan of.” In Canada, she said, “we almost exclusively use our job titles to define who we are.” Sometimes we go so far as to use our previous job to describe ourselves after we retire, in what Taylor calls a “backwards-looking identity.” Even when we’re not working, “we reinforce work as a critical piece of our own identity.” </p>
<p>John Davey worked at Dow Chemical in his hometown of Sarnia, Ontario, for thirty-two years. He left at age fifty-eight. “I didn’t retire. I <em>was retired</em>,” Davey, who’s now seventy-two, told me. It was part of a company-wide downscaling (he bears no grudges). It took less than a month for him to understand he was not the stay-at-home type. “One day, I sat in my living room and hoped it would snow so I could go out and shovel.” He’s worked ever since, most recently as a flower-delivery-person. “I know men who say they are going to regrout the bathroom or whatever, but that’s done and then what?” he said.</p>
<p>Don O’Connor put the perils of not having purpose more starkly. He was in wealth management and real estate at TD Bank, in Toronto, for thirty-six years, so his financial literacy was better than the average Canadian’s. COVID made him realize how much he hated the three-hour commute, and so he retired last year, at sixty-two. Now he works part time at a funeral home in Burlington and loves everything about it&mdash;two-minute drive, flexible hours, every day is different&mdash;and puts up with the mild astonishment of his friends about his new job, because, as he told me on our call, “if you don’t do anything, you’re on an express route to death.” </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="smallcaps">ere&#8217;s a bleak</span> prospect for many retiring Canadians: they will leave or be pushed out of the workforce too soon and without enough money. They’re financially prepared for the short and medium haul of life after work, but not the long one. They will go on to live too long, in too poor health (increased life expectancy has also increased the number of years people spend being sick), with a dwindling ability to support themselves or live independently. Ultimately, they’ll become wards of the state, housed in long-term care at great cost to the government and society. Sinha said: “This is where our destitute end up, in these government-run facilities.” According to a 2019 report by the National Institute on Ageing at Toronto Metropolitan University, long-term care costs <a href="https://www.niageing.ca/commentary-posts/10/7/long-term-care-costs-in-canada-projected-to-triple-in-only-30-years" rel="noopener" target="_blank">are expected to</a> triple from $22 billion to $71 billion by 2050. “It will be the equivalent of the modern-day Victorian poor house for our old,” Sinha said.</p>
<p>“We know this for a fact: the human brain is not equipped to make long-term decisions,” said Bonnie-Jeanne MacDonald, director of financial security research at the <a href="https://www.niageing.ca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Institute on Ageing</a>. “The human brain is very optimistic, which is great, but it can’t process the bad things that will happen in the future.” Decisions made now are not just for yourself in five years but for you in thirty years. “And that’s going to be a much more vulnerable person than you are right now, health wise.” </p>
<p>The National Institute on Ageing report says that, by 2050, care in one’s own home will cost up to $25,000 a month; care in a retirement home or residence could be as much as $10,000 a month. Those options will be unaffordable for most Canadians. Meanwhile, the number of people caring for family members at home will decrease sharply. Between now and 2050, Canada is expected to have 30 percent fewer voluntary caregivers, according to Sinha. Paid health care workers will not fill the gap: Canada’s universal health care system “was never designed to cover the provision of long-term care services,” including home and community care nursing, Sinha said. Long-term care insurance (LTCI) is now mandatory in Germany, South Korea, and Japan. Here in Canada, home-based care doesn’t even cover prescription medications. According to that 2019 Canadian Financial Capability Survey, a third of Canadians also worry they won’t be able to afford health care costs as they age, and rightly so. </p>
<p>“We spend the majority of our life savings paying for care in the last ten years of our life,” said Klein, the financial manager who put my life expectancy at ninety-four, which is sounding less and less like good news. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">f we could</span> create a different kind of retirement in Canada, a more inclusive, more creative, and flexible concept of work&mdash;and one that erased the grim picture of poor houses for the old&mdash;where would we start? After talking to dozens of experts and retired Canadians, three ideas, or ideals, formed my personal retirement manifesto. </p>
<p>The first would be to make measures against ageism part of every company’s fair-employment practice. Imagine a legacy career path that sees Canadians move from a forty- to a sixty-year work life, without censure or ridicule for being too old to work. I think of what Taylor said: “People change jobs all the time, but as we get older, we think we must continue doing exactly what we’re doing now or fall off a cliff. These are extreme alternatives.” The more high powered the job, and the higher in pay scale, the more we believe there is nowhere for workers to go but out. But many older workers prefer to forgo the intensity of management responsibilities, higher salaries, and relentless climbing and return to the craft work they excelled at in the beginning of their careers&mdash;even for a lot less money. Go ahead and ask them. As my own career wound down, I often thought&mdash;but did not say&mdash;that I wanted to go back to writing and editing, to revive my love of words that had taken me all the way to senior news director at the CBC, where I wasn’t allowed anywhere near copy.  </p>
<p>The second tenet of my manifesto is phased retirement. This one took me a while to get to, even though every expert and most of the retirees I spoke to were for it. I asked fellow CBC leader Greg Reaume, sixty-eight, who retired from running world news at CBC News a few months before I left myself, what he’d have said if I’d asked him to stay on a couple of days a week for the next two years, or if we’d opened that option to everybody. “A minefield,” Reaume said. “And complicated to manage.” “Right?” I agreed. Which is exactly the problem. Even if bosses like us believe in and desire phased retirement, taking on the labour-intensive job of juggling the options (do you make it mandatory to offer, but voluntary to accept?) and coordinating the schedules of part-time staff would keep managers from getting on side. We need to get them on side, though, because think of the benefits: to the worker who wants to keep contributing, to the employer who keeps getting returns on their experience and work ethic, and to the Canadian economy in need of workers. Figure that out and we move toward retirement becoming an adaptive and gradual transition rather than an on/off switch. Indeed, Klassen’s research showed a strong preference among older workers to gradually ease out of full-time employment, working fewer days over a period of several years. His definition of retirement is “a transition from working mostly full time to not working mostly full time.” </p>
<p>Finally, I propose we find new words to describe both retirement and retirees. A line from a 2014 <em>Atlantic</em> story on American retirement <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/09/the-great-stock-myth/308178/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">puts the lie</a> to the core idea of traditional retirement. “I don’t know if it’s ever going to be realistic that everyone saves enough to spend the last third of their life on vacation,” New York economist and author Allison Schrager was quoted as saying. (When I called her recently to ask if she still stood by this idea, her answer was a firm <em>yes</em>.) That vision of retirement, the one my father enjoyed and the one I had teed up for myself? None of it makes any sense anymore. Media, banks, and self-help books have lately been bandying around the term “The New Retirement,” but we should really be talking about the end of retirement. Instead of talking about “The Retired,” we should be talking about “The <em>Un</em>retired.” Not the undead&mdash;not yet&mdash;but maybe as indomitable. </p>
<p>Except that’s not right either. If our goal is to have Canadians work for as long as they’re excited and willing and able and empowered to do so, how about if we just call them workers? Because the essential zeitgeist of the retiree in 2023 is to keep working, however that looks. </p>
<p>Raymond Betts, even as he moves from being “goal oriented to soul oriented,” told me he will “never retire. My father worked until he was ninety-seven and died four months later, at ninety-eight.” Betts wasn’t sure he’d see the point in going on without work. “Work gives me a reason to call someone,” he said. “I have a mission. I have a reason to talk to people.”</p>
<p>Mieko Ise believes retirement is a time to take risks in a way that younger people who need to keep their jobs can’t. “Speak out!” she said. “I want to be reinvigorated, not retired.” Vicki Obedkoff, who retired in Saskatoon at seventy-one, after forty years as a minister with the United Church of Canada, fights for the same causes she’s always supported: climate change, human rights, and social justice. She quoted Alice Walker: activism is my rent for living on the planet. “I think about her often,” said Obedkoff. “I can’t see a time in the future when I will let this work go.”</p>
<p>Marjorie Beaucage, a seventy-six-year-old artist and Elder who lives in Duck Lake, Saskatchewan, was baffled by the whole idea of retirement. “I don’t know any of those retired people,” she said. “Elders don’t retire. Neither do artists. For Elders, this time of life is the busiest. You have to be there for your community.”</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smallcaps">he way I think</span> about my own retirement has changed significantly since I started working on this article. I’m part of a generation that will live the longest in history and also work the longest, if the big thinkers&mdash;and the workers themselves&mdash;succeed in moving Canadians from a forty-year career path to a sixty-year one. It’s new terrain, and the best way through is to be alert, adaptable, open to failure, and ready to act fast on success. </p>
<p>I don’t see retiring when I did as a failure&mdash;I had my second career as a writer I wanted to focus on and that grandson I’m gaga to spend time with. But I wonder why I didn’t have the conversation about a staged departure into a different kind of role, or why no one else had it with me. </p>
<p>I’m newly alert to dinner-table banter that turns ageist. It is without exception driven by people my age. “It’s time for the old farts to make way for the next generation,” said one retired financial industry executive at a recent dinner party when the conversation turned to the <em>Globe and Mail</em>’s leadership. (Phillip Crawley, publisher, announced <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-globe-and-mail-ceo-phillip-crawley-to-retire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his retirement</a> a month later, at seventy-eight.) “Hold on,” I said and then held forth on what I’ve learned about age prejudice. It may have been obnoxious. I will probably keep doing it. (Speak out, inner rebel!) </p>
<p>For now, I’m following Benjamin Klein’s simple financial advice: more input, less output. “Those are the only two things we can control,” he said. Which could mean getting a job&mdash;and not in management or journalism but something completely different. I’ve been an admirer of people who dedicate their retirement to volunteer work but felt pity when I saw someone my own age shelving groceries or working as a greeter. Now I think, “Long life headed your way, my friend!” I’ve stopped “backwards identifying” myself by the work I used to do, after Lisa Taylor asked me to “please be bold and to introduce yourself as you are now.” In my case, that’s as a writer. Now and then I even try to picture my future self, thirty years from now, but Bonnie-Jeanne MacDonald is right. It’s unfathomable. I accept that older Cathrin will be more fragile. Hopefully not in the poor house but perhaps a modest room or two, with a few things to remind me of the people I love&mdash;and also with the people I love. Likely I won’t be working. We can but hope. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/the-end-of-retirement/">The End of Retirement</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

A large black granite marker next to the fountain reads, “Canada and Italy: war brought us together, and peace made us friends.”</p>
<p>I burst into tears. Gabriele pulls me into a hug. Across the way are cafes patronized by aging nonni who sit in the sun with their drinks.</p>
<p>You could say this is a homecoming for Gabriele, as his family comes from Pescara, the next town. In many ways, it is a homecoming for me too, even though I’ve never been here and I’m not Italian.</p>
<p>We are here because my jido&mdash;my grandfather&mdash;was an infantryman during the Second World War. He was among the Canadian troops sent to Ortona in December 1943 to take back the town from the occupying Nazis. I have read everything I can about the Battle of Ortona. I know that, after six days of fighting, the German paratroopers retreated under the cover of night. The Canadians considered themselves victorious, though they suffered hundreds of casualties and most of Ortona had been destroyed. </p>

</ul>
<p>While Jido was one of the lucky few who managed to make it home after the war, he was not without scars. The Battle of Ortona left him deaf in one ear; shrapnel was permanently embedded in his back. He also had post-traumatic stress disorder. I’m told that, for decades after the war, whenever a car backfired or the sky produced a thunderclap, he would dive under the table. He died in 1982, at the age of fifty-nine, from leukemia and a heart attack. I was a baby then and have no memory of him, but there are pictures of us together. In some of them, he’s holding or tickling me. </p>
<p>For most of my life, stories abounded of Jido as a man with a devilish sense of humour, as a doting husband, and as a loving father. But he never spoke about his war service, and even my sito, my grandmother, couldn’t tell me anything about that period of his life. Though I always wondered about the enigmatic veteran in my family, the Second World War seemed abstract, something that had happened a million years ago on the other side of the planet. </p>
<p>When my sito passed away, in 2016, I inherited all of Jido’s things that she had meticulously preserved: his war medals, his dog tags&mdash;barely legible&mdash;and his service records. Running my fingers over original telegrams and marconigrams sent to my great-grandmother, informing her Jido was missing in action on two different occasions, suddenly made the war more immediate, more tangible. It was something I could hold and feel between my fingers. </p>
<p>Still, I never got the chance to ask Jido all the questions brewing in my head: What did he see? How many people did he kill? How many friends did he lose? What did the battle rip from him? It took the racist comments of a national icon to propel me to dive deeper into those questions.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">n 2019,</span> Don Cherry, former co-host of <em>Coach’s Corner</em>, infamously derided new Canadian immigrants for neglecting to wear the poppy during Remembrance Day. Denigrating new Canadians as using the country for its “milk and honey,” Cherry used the term “you people,” a racist dog whistle, during a national broadcast. </p>
<p>I tweeted at Cherry, telling him about Jido, who was one of the few Arabs in the Canadian army at the time. My family is Syrian and Lebanese, having emigrated to Montreal over 120 years ago, and I wanted to prove that non-white immigrants had also fought to defend this country. My post garnered enough traction on social media that it caught the attention of news outlets. I was invited to speak about Jido on CTV News Network and CJAD 800. But even as I was interviewed on television and radio programs about how proud I was of having a war hero in my family, I didn’t know what that truly entailed. </p>
<p>Cherry was eventually fired for his comments. But given the widespread racism in the Canadian Armed Forces, coupled with the ongoing anti-Arab and anti-immigrant rhetoric in our culture, I felt I had to honour Jido&mdash;to walk in his footsteps and bear witness to what the war took from him. </p>
<p>When you’re missing integral pieces of the puzzle, there’s little choice but to do the work yourself to fill in the blanks. Being in Ortona, surrounded by green olive orchards and the remnants of bombed-out cathedrals, I could feel the pieces of Jido he had left behind. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">J</span><span class="smallcaps">ido’s father,</span> Michael Zarbatany, fled Damascus in 1906 with his Lebanese wife, Mary Attabe, and was the priest at one of the oldest Syrian Orthodox parishes in Canada, St. Nicholas Antiochian Orthodox Church, which still stands to this day, in Montreal. Michael was also a justice of the peace and started the first Arabic-language newspaper in Canada, called <em>Ash-Shehab</em>, “the Brilliant Star.” </p>
<p>As I went through Sito’s records, I found myself tickled by the idea that Jido, by contrast, was a bit of a rebel. His report cards from 1939 show him antagonizing his teachers by smoking tobacco while at school and eternally arriving late for class. “This is ridiculous!” one report card screams. That year, when the Nazis invaded Poland and war was declared, Jido lied about his age&mdash;he was only sixteen&mdash;and volunteered to join the Canadian Armed Forces. He was placed with the Loyal Edmonton Regiment and shipped off to London, then North Africa, before he fought his way through Italy. By the time he engaged the Nazis in Ortona, Jido was twenty years old. Many in his band of brothers were barely eighteen. His letters home had no mention of what he was seeing in Italy, just pleas to his mother not to worry about him.</p>
<p>I’ve read about intergenerational trauma, the idea that our ancestors’ pain can be passed down. Looking around Ortona, bullet holes still peppering the bricks, I can feel something in my bones, haunting me. As Gabriele and I move through the village, visiting the Santa Maria di Constantinopoli cathedral where the Canadians held Christmas dinner during the battle in 1943, I have the strange sense that I’ve already been here&mdash;as if memories are being transmitted to me. I imagine men clinking their standard-issue tin cups, filled with beer and local wine. The scrape of cutlery against dishes. The smell of pork with applesauce, boiled cauliflower, mashed potatoes with gravy, and mince pies for dessert. I imagine the snap of a Christmas cracker, the paper crown placed atop a soldier’s head, and the low humming of “Silent Night.”</p>
<p>Right as we pass the Price of Peace statue, which depicts a Canadian soldier hovering over a wounded comrade, we hear music from a solo trumpet&mdash;a somber and solemn tune, not unlike “The Last Post”&mdash;playing through an open window overlooking the steep ridge that drops down to the water. </p>
<p>At the visitor’s centre, the staff tell us that some of the men from Jido’s Loyal Edmonton Regiment lie buried in the Moro River Canadian War Cemetery, a few kilometres south of the village. We bike part of the way and then continue on foot, hiking up a winding back road and then cutting through a private olive orchard&mdash;the harvest in progress&mdash;to reach the cemetery. As we walk, I wonder if this was the site of one of the Germans’ famous ambushes. In his book <em>Ortona: Canada’s Epic World War II Battle</em>, military historian Mark Zuehlke describes how, at one point, the Germans emerged from their positions with hands raised in surrender. As Canadian soldiers walked out to meet them, he writes, “the Germans dropped to the ground, as if on command, and a machine gun emplaced behind them ripped into the Canadians.” <em>Jido, did that happen here?</em> I wonder. <em>Did it happen to you?</em> </p>
<p>There are 1,375 Canadian soldiers buried in the cemetery, and over fifty of the graves are of soldiers who were never identified. As we pass gravestone after gravestone, it strikes me that I’m able to visit their final resting place only because Jido <em>isn’t</em> buried here. Had he died in the battle, I wouldn’t exist. </p>
<p>It’s at this moment that I recall the story Sito loved to tell about meeting Jido after he had settled back into civilian life. It was 1947. She was sitting in a booth at a soda shop on Bélanger Street in Montreal with her girlfriends when in <em>he</em> walked. Upon their introduction, he pointed squarely at her and said, “You I’m going to sleep with.” She smacked him right across his face. </p>
<p>Holding his cheek, he barked, “What are you doing, you dumb broad? I’m paying you a compliment!” </p>
<p>“Those kinds of compliments I don’t need,” she retorted. </p>
<p>A year later, they were married.</p>
<p>I want to laugh at the brazen meet-cute, but the cemetery is quiet. We see no other visitors there. I wonder if those buried here have any visitors at all. </p>
<p>In this moment, I realize that, in my case, a large part of my remembrance involves this pilgrimage to a small village hovering on the Adriatic to confront Jido’s trauma, passed down through the blood, taking decades to be fully grasped. I can picture before me a twenty-year-old kid advancing through this town as his brothers in uniform vaporize next to him in a cloud of pink mist, an experience that forever changed his relationship with the world around him.</p>
<p>But another part&mdash;equal in size and loaded with just as much meaning&mdash;is remembering all aspects of Jido beyond his wartime service. Jido was his own person before the war&mdash;sometimes impish, often hard-headed, fiercely loyal to those he loved&mdash;and the war didn’t change that. </p>
<p>He travelled the world with Sito. When they had my mother, he raised her under his watchful eye, curiously enough allowing her to become a belly dancer but drawing the line at letting her see the Beatles live in concert. He lived to see his only daughter marry in the ’70s and to meet his two grandchildren in the ’80s&mdash;albeit only briefly before the war raging in his own veins caught up with him.</p>
<p>I can admire the man beyond the “war hero” moniker. When I was little, Remembrance Day ceremonies and commemorations were a chore&mdash;long school assemblies, reciting “In Flanders Fields” by heart, making poppies out of red cardstock. Now, Remembrance Day, for me, isn’t just about commemorating brave acts on the battlefield. It can also be about smiling about a life well lived, even when it isn’t pretty or something you would pin to your lapel.</p>
<p>On our last night in Ortona, Gabriele and I return to the Canada–Italy friendship fountain, which is arcing red and white lights through the streams of water. Grabbing a piece of chalk, I stand in the middle of the maple leaf and write: </p>
<p>“Victor Zarbatany was here, 1943.”</p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/my-grandpa-never-spoke-of-the-war-i-needed-to-see-where-he-fought/">My Grandpa Never Spoke of the War.

A key figure in “Germans from Russia” studies, he was admired by a network of North American academics and Germanophiles, many of whom treated his wartime research as foundational. The lecture’s subject&mdash;ethnic Germans in Eastern Europe and their abuse at the hands of the Soviet Union&mdash;would also have struck a chord with the city’s large German community, some of whom had fled communist persecution.</p>
<p>The WAG advertised the free public event in its 1973 event calendar, and the city’s Canadian German newspapers promoted it. But one would be hard pressed to find mention of the lecture anywhere else. One reason might be that Stumpp, as is more widely known today, was a Nazi whose legacy is inextricably linked to the Final Solution. His authority on the lecture’s subject rested largely on surveys of German Ukrainian villages he’d overseen in the 1940s in Nazi-occupied Ukraine. This occupation gave Stumpp unique access to German communities hitherto hidden behind Soviet borders. But his studies were decidedly not of the disinterested scientific variety. After Einsatzgruppen killing squads cleansed a village of “undesirables,” Stumpp’s own eighty-man action unit moved in to determine the survivors’ racial character. Those deemed lacking sufficient “German blood” were likely murdered, helping rid the Greater Reich of what Stumpp’s diaries describe as “the Bolshevik-Jewish plague.” </p>

</ul>
<p>It’s apparent from their writings that, by 1973, many of Stumpp’s closest North American colleagues understood his research was pursued within the Nazi apparatus, even if they were sketchy on certain details. This understanding was shared by at least one Winnipeg professor involved with organizing Stumpp’s lecture tour in Canada. Enough was also made known publicly about Stumpp’s past that a German article promoting the WAG event could advertise him as managing director of the People’s Association for Germans Abroad (1933–1938) and head of the Research Center for Russian Germans (1938–1945)&mdash;job titles, given their time frames, that practically Sieg Heil off the page. </p>
<p>What knowledge did WAG’s management have of Stumpp’s genocidal associations at the time of his lecture? Was his presence at the gallery, an elegant modernist space that had opened less than two years earlier, simply a matter of oversight? Posing such questions some fifty years later would seem less significant if it weren’t for another virtually unknown fact: Austrian-born Ferdinand Eckhardt, the trailblazing WAG director in charge at the time&mdash;and who, the local newspaper <em>Courier Nordwesten</em> reports, attended Stumpp’s lecture as an “honoured guest”&mdash;was himself a Nazi fellow traveller during the Third Reich. </p>
<p>Eckhardt’s public endorsements of Nazism include signing an oath of allegiance to Hitler and producing several polemics in far-right and Nazified journals in the early 1930s, urging, among other things, that Germany’s cultural arena align itself with the goals of the Nazi state. Eckhardt went to work for one of the most notorious players in Hitler’s war machine, IG Farben, the same company that built the Auschwitz concentration camp and manufactured Zyklon-B, used in the gas chambers to kill over 2.5 million people. Eckhardt hid his Nazi statements, but they have cropped up in the margins and footnotes of Nazi cultural histories for years. They are summarized at some length by German art historian Andreas Zeising, whose profile of Eckhardt in his 2018 book, <em><a href="https://www.vandenhoeck-ruprecht-verlage.com/themen-entdecken/kunst-und-architektur/kunstgeschichte-kunstwissenschaft/50300/radiokunstgeschichte" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Radiokunstgeschichte</a></em>, has yet to make a notable impression on Canadian commentary, perhaps partially because it has not been translated. (When reached for comment, the WAG stressed that they have no knowledge of Eckhardt’s Nazi past and that it’s “highly unlikely the [WAG’s hiring] committee would have selected someone with any connection to the Nazis.”) </p>
<p>What Eckhardt knew of Stumpp’s complicity with mass murder has yet to be determined. But the episode raises further questions about the extent to which one of the country’s most pioneering art gallery directors had outgrown his far-right politics by the time he led central Canada’s pre-eminent arts institution. The relevance of such questions isn’t just fodder for social media campaigns to have names changed on this hall or that library. For all the popular talk today, in the fine arts world and beyond, of “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” the museum world has a Nazi problem. For a gang of brutes and supposed philistines, the Nazis were unusually interested in aesthetics, an appetite their regime helped satisfy by plundering some 600,000 works from Jewish people. An estimated 100,000 of these haven’t been returned to their rightful owners, and many of them are still possessed and displayed by Western museums&mdash;some, likely, in Canada. But as Eckhardt’s and Stumpp’s cases show, artworks weren’t the only Nazi exports hosted by Canadian museums. </p>
<p>This fall, now-resigned Liberal house speaker Anthony Rota prompted the House of Commons, and visiting Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to join him in unwittingly applauding a Waffen-SS ex-member living in Canada. Social media lit up with mockery of Liberal naivety and incompetence. But this has given way to more soul searching about Canada’s troubling record of providing haven to thousands of alleged Nazi expats. From accusations of actively encouraging suspected Nazis to resettle here to later dragging their heels on prosecuting war criminals, governments from both sides of the aisle have a lot to answer for.  </p>
<p>A thoroughgoing discussion about the relationship of Canadian museums to Nazism could knit these themes together, probing to see how many Nazi expats worked in Canada’s cultural sector, shaping public programming, museum collections, and the country’s culture and memory through the postwar period. In Eckhardt, we have a disquieting case of a Nazi sympathizer who enjoyed such influence. It’s time Canadians confronted this fact. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="smallcaps">erdinand Eckhardt</span> (1902–1995) and his wife, Sophie-Carmen Eckhardt-Gramatté (1898–1974), are among Canada’s most legendary artistic couples. They’re also parental figures in modernism’s birth in the Canadian prairies. Modernism, an originally European tradition, is sometimes imagined as a sort of negative image of fascism&mdash;a perception encouraged by the Nazis’ persecution of this movement. Modernism arrived late to the Canadian prairies, and in architecture, visual arts, and music, Eckhardt and his wife were among its key shepherds. So it’s easy to see why, for Canadians wondering about Eckhardt’s Third Reich–era politics, his achievements may have thrown many off the scent.  </p>
<p>A short summary of the couple’s careers might be helpful to the general reader. Though Eckhardt-Gramatté was a virtuoso on both piano and violin, her celebrity in Canada rests primarily on her stature as one of our greatest composers. After the death of her famous expressionist artist husband, Walter Gramatté, she married Eckhardt, an arts critic–cum–advertising manager, in 1934. In 1942, Eckhardt was conscripted into the German Army. Amid the war’s climax, Eckhardt still found time to cultivate a salon-like atmosphere in their Vienna home. In <em><a href="https://uofmpress.ca/books/detail/music-from-within" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Music from Within</a></em>, Eckhardt’s biography of his wife, he describes hosting house concerts in 1943 where “[s]trangers as well as good friends attended; Nazis and Jews rubbed shoulders. All were linked by a love of music.” </p>
<p>In postwar Vienna, Eckhardt-Gramatté cemented her reputation as a leading composer, and her husband worked in art education for the Art History Museum. However, according to Eckhardt, he grew alienated from the Vienna art world. He later remarks, “My way of thinking was much too advanced.” Clearly, his unease also owed something to the fact that the museum’s “arrogant” director suspected him of being a Nazi, which, Eckhardt notes, caused him professional troubles. Eckhardt denied the accusation but convinced his wife to move overseas to an isolated prairie city where he had been offered a job as Winnipeg Art Gallery director. </p>
<p>Eckhardt-Gramatté’s early impressions of the city were said to be unflattering; she first regarded Winnipeg as a cultural backwater. The late-blooming Eckhardt, meanwhile, at the time in his fifties, finally came into his own, professionally, in Winnipeg. Under his impressive tenure as the WAG’s director (1953–1974), for which he was inducted into the Order of Canada, the institution grew from a two-employee gallery to the prairie beacon of fine art it is today. It was under Eckhardt that the main WAG facility, a 110,000-square-foot triangular mass of Manitoba Tyndall Stone and an icon of prairie modernism, was built. </p>
<p>Boasting personal ties to top German expressionists and the great Jewish artist Marc Chagall, Eckhardt led the charge in putting European and Canadian modern art in front of Winnipeg. He’s also said to have spearheaded the WAG’s collection of Inuit art, now the world’s largest of its kind. Eckhardt-Gramatté ultimately plunged into her new milieu, developing strong ties with various orchestras and leaving behind one of Canada’s most significant bodies of classical music. She is the subject of multiple books, documentaries, and even a play performed in Toronto in spring 2023. </p>
<p>Both Eckhardt and Eckhardt-Gramatté remain honoured figures in Canada, with libraries, halls, a foundation, a music competition, and an eminent art collection bearing at least one of their names. Eckhardt’s stature isn’t just based on his accomplishments but on what he seemingly represents: the triumphant spread of modernism and cosmopolitanism over a provincial “hinterland” like Manitoba, with stops along the way to spotlight the best in local colour and to amplify Indigenous voices. In short, the “march of progress” in a way Canadians may like to imagine it. </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">E</span><span class="smallcaps">ckhardt’s image </span> as an unrelenting champion of modernism, and German expressionism in particular, lends him a brave and subversive air relative to National Socialism’s violent attacks on the movement. It’s an image he encouraged&mdash;and one still given a stamp of approval today by the media and arts world. But significant omissions during the ’30s exist in his official bibliography. We have historian Andreas Zeising, primarily, to thank for recovering and filling in the relevant gaps. </p>
<p>As Zeising documents, over nearly ten articles and statements between 1932 and 1934, Eckhardt expressed mounting zeal for the national revolution occurring in Germany. So fierce were his polemics against a decadent art world, calling for a “clean up” by a strong state, he alienated even many of his conservative peers. Eckhardt’s articles run together many of the usual tropes of Nazi cultural politics. They evoke a corrupt elite&mdash;associated variously with individualism, liberalism, lack of national sentiment, commercialism, abstraction, and art for art’s sake&mdash;which he pits against an idealized German “Volk,” a racially exclusive category in Nazi ideology whose true spirit is embodied in the “new state.” Eckhardt demands that the radio and museum worlds promote German folk art and conform to the goals of National Socialism in a spirit of “blood and soil.” One of their most notorious slogans, “blood and soil” is a key term in the Nazis’ justification for eugenics and territorial conquest. </p>
<p>Eckhardt’s statements in the early 1930s don’t appear to be the reluctant words of an intellectual cowed by a totalitarian state. Rather, they resound as fascist battle cries during the Third Reich’s infancy. Doubling down on his journalistic polemics, in October 1933, Eckhardt joined eighty-seven other writers in signing (roughly translated from the German) the “pledge of the most faithful allegiance” to Hitler. Spearheaded by the Prussian Academy of Arts, the appeal signalled compliance with the recently passed Editors’ Law, a key instrument for Nazi control over the publishing industry. </p>
<p>Eckhardt’s unpublished memoirs became accessible at the Archives of Manitoba this fall. In them, he comes clean about some, but not all, of his pro-Nazi and far-right polemics, particularly those that caused him lasting embarrassment. Elsewhere, Eckhardt had publicly claimed that the <em>Völkischer Beobachter</em>, the main Nazi newspaper, had once “reprinted, in mutilated form,” an article of his. Now he confesses to submitting the article directly to the newspaper but complains they amplified its antisemitic content. Eckhardt tells us that the piece was preceded by a companion article which he submitted to <em>Die Tat</em>, a leading voice of Germany’s so-called Conservative Revolution, causing a stir in the German art scene. He also admits to associating with the Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur (Militant League for German Culture)&mdash;a Nazi Party organ using thuggish Brownshirt tactics to rid German art of “degenerative Jewish and negro influences”&mdash;in whose journal, <em>Deutsche Kultur-Wacht</em>, you can find articles by Eckhardt. Also just made accessible at the archives is a folder from Eckhardt’s estate with the darkly sarcastic title “Mein Kunstkampf,” wherein Eckhardt encloses more documents relating to his pro-Nazi activities and affiliations over 1932/33.</p>
<p>For a cosmopolitan figure once so dedicated to the avant-garde, Eckhardt’s foray into Nazi politics may seem like a curiosity&mdash;a regrettable detour by a young writer who lost his composure while trying to come out on top amid the art world shakeup the Nazis were unleashing. He would hardly have been the only German modernist who, contrary to stereotype, scrambled to make himself useful to the regime. </p>
<p>But if naivety and opportunism were Eckhardt’s overarching sins as a Nazi cooperator, the pattern doesn’t stop there. Eckhardt temporarily retired as a writer, at the behest of his new employer, after joining Bayer as an advertising manager in 1933, the same year the company began its purge of Jewish employees. At that time, and until the war’s end, Bayer was a division of IG Farben, one of the Nazi-collaborating firms most complicit in the Final Solution. Cementing IG Farben’s notoriety is its centrality to the Third Reich’s Four-Year Plan (1936–1940) and, ultimately, to the Nazi war machine: its intensive use of slave labour, including the forced labour of upward of 10,000 inmates from Auschwitz, whose facilities the company helped build; its horrific experiments, with Bayer’s involvement, on concentration camp inmates; and its production of Zyklon-B, the preferred killing tool for the Nazi gas chambers. </p>
<p>When describing his career at IG Farben, Eckhardt tends to emphasize his apparently apolitical work in advertising aspirin for Bayer. Yet Eckhardt also tells us that in 1938, owing to the impending war, he was compelled to switch from advertising to the company’s “scientific division.” With war on the horizon, it’s unsurprising that IG Farben no longer had need for an aspirin adman&mdash;Eckhardt could be put to better use elsewhere in the company, whose most powerful buyer now was the Nazi state. By 1940, IG Farben was well integrated into the Nazi war machine, being a key source of the army’s drugs, fuel, explosives, and rubber, and it was employing forced labour at its production plants. Eckhardt remained at the company until mid-1942, about six months after the Final Solution had become Nazi policy, at which point he was conscripted into the German Army. But this did not end his IG Farben career. After being discharged from the army in November 1944, Eckhardt returned to Bayer, his memoirs confirm, where he was employed until the war’s end. What Eckhardt knew of IG Farben’s atrocities during the war can’t yet be said with certainty, though Peter Hayes, an eminent historian of the company, has written “the killings were an open secret within Farben.” </p>
<p>The final verdict on Eckhardt may be that, after his Nazi writings stopped, he mostly behaved in the way of many Germans&mdash;acquiescing to the status quo to survive. Eckhardt may well have regretted some of his Third Reich–era activities, for reasons of self-interest, genuine remorse, or both. And yet we shouldn’t dismiss the possibility that Eckhardt, even by his WAG career’s end, still kept faith with his earlier sensibilities and outlook.  </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="smallcaps">et’s return to our</span> opening scene: Nazi ethnographer Karl Stumpp’s lecture at the Winnipeg Art Gallery in the summer of 1973, while Eckhardt was still WAG director. Did Eckhardt greenlight the lecture? We know he attended and even mentioned it in his private journal and personal calendar. While we can’t say definitively if he had any knowledge of Stumpp’s résumé as a Nazi who worked in tandem with the SS killing squads, Stumpp’s lecture dovetails with Eckhardt’s essays of the interwar period. In them, the line between education and propaganda is blurred, and he hammers on about the need for museums to throw off their specialized, elitist orientation to promote racial consciousness among the German Volk. In this light, it doesn’t seem that surprising that a public lecture with overtones of German identity politics by another Nazi affiliate may have appealed to him. </p>
<p>In recent decades, German studies scholars have been reckoning with Stumpp’s legacy. Eckhardt’s legacy calls for a similar reckoning. The Winnipeg Art Gallery is as vital a vessel of Canada’s visual culture as any on the prairies. More work must be done to study how Eckhardt’s Nazi ideas coloured his postwar influence on this culture. This includes shedding light on the provenance records of his and his wife’s personal art collection, much of which now lives at the WAG. In 2014, the WAG joined six Canadian galleries to work with two international researchers to determine whether any artworks they possessed had been procured from looting during the Second World War. When reached for comment, the WAG claimed they found no evidence of looting. Given that a Nazi sympathizer once owned hundreds of pieces now in their collection, perhaps it’s time to more publicly clear the air on this matter.</p>
<p>How Eckhardt even managed to inveigle his way into the Canadian art world and rise to the top deserves scrutiny too. Rumours of being a Nazi trailed him across the Atlantic. In Canada, he also never hid that he’d worked at IG Farben, even if he was cagey about how he framed this career. But concerns for Jewish welfare and dignity weren’t exactly front of mind among Winnipeg&#8217;s more powerful gentile communities when Eckhardt arrived in the 1950s. Indeed, until the 1970s, Jewish people weren’t allowed as members by many of Winnipeg’s elite social clubs, which served largely as old-boy and old-girl networks for the city’s more genteel gentiles (although much energy has been spent in recent decades to overcome such overtly racial cliquiness). Were Winnipeggers mostly convinced of Eckhardt’s progressive persona, or did many look the other way when it came to his shady past? </p>
<p>If gaze averting helps explain the hospitality Eckhardt received in Manitoba, perhaps a certain credulity, too, is at work here. When those with deeply illiberal pedigrees come knocking, they often don’t present as such. They don’t necessarily cut the image of barbaric populists from the hinterland rattling their sabres outside the city gate. They may arrive with an air of modernism, multiculturalist politics, cosmopolitanism, or principled anti-Stalinism serving to disguise their dark pasts.  </p>
<p>The WAG that I know is an outstanding institution. Few organizations so admirably balance commitments to artistic excellence and social justice. But while much talk of inclusivity emanates from the WAG and so many cultural institutions today, we face hard choices about inclusivity’s limits. As the old lesson goes, at some point, a culture of tolerance, to survive, may demand intolerance for the intolerant. No precise map exists for navigating this dilemma, and a misstep could mean forfeiting values we hold sacred. But maybe we can settle on a rule of thumb: we don’t break bread with Nazis. This goes for past fellow travellers as well as card carriers&mdash;Nazis whose evils are banal as well as spectacular. In this spirit, it’s time to eject Eckhardt from our institutions’ halls of fame. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/was-the-winnipeg-art-gallery-founded-by-a-nazi/">Was the Winnipeg Art Gallery Led by a Nazi?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

Sainte-Marie, now eighty-two, has long claimed that she was born on the Piapot First Nation in Saskatchewan and adopted by a white American family. But the CBC investigation convincingly concludes that she was born in Massachusetts to Italian American parents and, as her career blossomed and then flourished through the 1970s and onward, went to great lengths to conceal these origins in order to become one of the world’s most famous and beloved Indigenous icons. </p>
<p>Sainte-Marie’s accomplishments are long. She was the first Indigenous person to win an Academy Award, in 1983; she has received fourteen honorary doctorates, six Juno Awards, a Golden Globe, and a Governor General’s Award; and she is an officer of the Order of Canada. Perhaps most broadly impactful were her appearances on <em><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/when-buffy-sainte-marie-met-big-bird/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sesame Street</a></em>, beginning in 1975, in which she shared and celebrated Cree culture in front of North American audiences. </p>
<p>Before all that, in her early twenties, Sainte-Marie was adopted by Emile Piapot and Clara Starblanket Piapot and has called them her family ever since. Her story of abduction and displacement, of reclamation and reconnection, echoed the events of the Sixties Scoop, in which some 20,000 Indigenous children were adopted out of their communities between the 1950s and 1980s. The day before the CBC published their investigation, she issued a statement, alluding to family secrets and hinting that she may have been born out of wedlock&mdash;“on the wrong side of the blanket.” She refuted the reporting. “All I can say is that what I know to be true,” she said in her statement, “I know who I love, and I know who loves me. And I know who claims me.”</p>

</ul>
<p>What the CBC decided to include in their investigation makes a case that is compelling; what they left out is puzzling. Journalists are not impartial transcribers of facts; they choose what to include and what to omit. This process is dynamic, like a spotlight tracking the truth, illuminating selected details while leaving others in shadow. It is the journalist’s duty to stand behind not only the stories they tell but <em>how</em> they have chosen to tell them. The CBC’s decisions in this regard deserve scrutiny.</p>
<p>In his editor’s blog, the CBC’s Brodie Fenlon described the high bar that the organization sets for such stories, writing, “Reporting on stories of false Indigeneity is very much in the public interest. Experts in the field have said time and again that failing to challenge false narratives is contrary to the principles of truth and reconciliation.” Each subsequent takedown has set its sights on a larger and more ambitious target, and in their heightened drama, they have acquired the salacious tone of a true crime podcast rather than a dispassionate investigation. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/arts/commotion/two-indigenous-artists-react-to-the-questions-raised-about-buffy-sainte-marie-s-ancestry-1.7012424" rel="noopener" target="_blank">On the CBC podcast <em>Commotion</em></a>, Anishinaabekwe artist ShoShona Kish expressed her surprise with the framing of the episode. “I would have expected <em>Fifth Estate</em> to not treat it like tabloid television,” she said. “I felt like I was watching <em>TMZ</em>.” </p>
<p>The Sainte-Marie story raises an important question: Are “pretendian” investigations about entertainment or justice?</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smallcaps">eginning in 2016,</span> when APTN revealed that celebrated and acclaimed Canadian author Joseph Boyden had fabricated his claims of Indigenous ancestry, investigations into the spurious claims of prominent Indigenous figures have appeared frequently in Canadian media. There was director Michelle Latimer; there was activist Sacheen Littlefeather; there was Alberta premier Danielle Smith. <a href="https://macleans.ca/longforms/the-curious-case-of-gina-adams-a-pretendian-investigation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I wrote one myself</a>, last year, about the artist Gina Adams. </p>
<p>From the moment rumours about <em>The Fifth Estate</em>’s episode began swirling, the revelations about Sainte-Marie have felt different. The atmosphere of dread hung heavier than before as Indigenous people braced themselves for uninvited and painful truths. Despite knowing how carefully these stories are reported and fact-checked, and despite knowing from my own reporting how common Indigenous identity fraud is, part of me wanted to believe that this time the allegations were false. Then I sat down to watch the episode. </p>
<p>In the questions that the CBC chose to pursue, they are thorough. They travel to Stoneham, Massachusetts, to view an original birth certificate and question the town clerk about its authenticity, anticipating the skepticism of viewers. Sainte-Marie’s own shifting claims are detailed chronologically, plainly revealing the evolution of her origin story&mdash;early in her career, articles described her as Algonquin, then Mi’kmaq, before settling on Cree&mdash;as well as her inconsistent statements on the details of her birth, documentation, and purported adoption.  </p>
<p>The investigation cites Sainte-Marie’s claim, in a 2017 interview, that a “friend who’s a Cree lawyer” concluded that her birth records were likely destroyed. Sainte-Marie’s presumably referring to Delia Opekokew, whom she hired to investigate her eligibility for Canadian citizenship and Indian status in the late 1970s, according to a sworn affidavit Opekokew submitted to APTN on October 25. In it, Opekokew also notes that she did not believe that Sainte-Marie’s American birth certificate “was a representation of Buffy Sainte-Marie’s identity and origins.” Opekokew stated in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/02/buffy-sainte-marie-documentary-controversy-indigenous-canada" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an interview with the <em>Guardian</em></a> that the CBC did not speak with her “as witness to the oral history.” It seems like a significant oversight not to include her perspective in the episode and not to try to understand why she found the birth certificate so much less compelling than the CBC did. </p>
<p>According to her affidavit, Opekokew recalls conducting interviews in both English and Cree with Piapot Elders, knowledge keepers, and Sainte-Marie’s adopted kin&mdash;none of whom appear directly in the CBC investigation. (The Piapot family did provide a letter referred to in the documentary affirming their position that Buffy is a member of their family.) The interviews offered consistent testimony and oral history evidence for the claim that Sainte-Marie was born “north of Piapot to a single mother who could not care for her, and that she gave Buffy to an American family who happened to be in the Piapot area.” This is perplexing&mdash;why would a couple from Massachusetts happen to be near a reserve in Saskatchewan, more than 3,400 kilometres away, and why would an incidental visit result in a secretive adoption? But the enormous discrepancy between Opekokew’s conclusions and those of the CBC reveals a crucial element missing from their investigation.</p>
<p>By all accounts, Saint-Marie has been an adopted member of the Piapot family, and recognized by the Piapot First Nation, for sixty years. But her Cree family and community are absent from the documentary. (In the episode, the CBC mentions only that the acting chief of the Piapot First Nation declined to comment.) Instead, two members of Sainte-Marie’s American family are interviewed: a cousin, who reportedly met her once, and Sainte-Marie’s niece, the daughter of her older brother Alan who Sainte-Marie alleges abused her as a child. Though the CBC investigation includes three Indigenous experts&mdash;Kim TallBear, Jacqueline Keeler, and Jean Teillet&mdash;none are Cree, and none speak to Cree practices. </p>
<p>Omitting the Cree perspective leaves the viewer without any context of Cree law, adoption, or kinship. Opekokew, who says in her affidavit that she spent two years on her investigation, has significant knowledge of the circumstances surrounding Sainte-Marie’s history. Why wasn’t she consulted or her investigation cited? There is no discussion in the episode of how the adoption of Indigenous children worked, how they were documented, and how their origins were obscured. Many Indigenous adoptees and adopted families have responded to the episode by pointing out the practice of falsifying or amending birth certificates, which has helped fuel speculation among supporters of Sainte-Marie. </p>
<p>Opekokew, in her affidavit, raises a critical point that the CBC leaves out: “It is my opinion and honest belief that Indigenous children who have been apprehended, adopted, scooped or who have attended Residential School, such as myself, continue to be Indigenous. And, children who are raised by Indigenous peoples without knowledge of where they come from other than their Indigenous family, are as much as members of our Indigenous family and community under our laws, as other immigrants of Canada are Canadian under common law.” She also writes that “whether Buffy Sainte-Marie was adopted or not, she was the daughter of Emile and Clara Piapot of Piapot First Nation without distinction.”</p>
<p>The CBC does not explore the distinctions between Indigenous ancestry and Indigenous citizenship; as to the former, they make the strong case that Buffy does not have the Cree ancestry she has claimed, a very serious and troubling revelation. By all accounts, she appropriated trauma and perpetuated tragic stereotypes about Indigenous people and received numerous awards and honours for it. But the investigation also glosses over the six decades that she has spent as a member of the Piapot family, recognized and embraced by the community. And by failing to take that into account, they make the same harmful and erroneous conflation that pretendians do themselves: acting as though a DNA test or distant ancestor can tell you whether you are Indigenous, omitting entirely the reciprocal recognition of a nation. This omission yields a lopsided investigation, one that effectively scandalizes viewers but fails to educate them about the nuances of Indigenous identity. </p>
<p>Métis lawyer Jean Teillet, one of the experts consulted by the CBC, has estimated that there are “tens of thousands” of people engaged in Indigenous identity fraud. Since I published my investigation on Gina Adams last year, my inbox has received a steady stream of messages about suspected deceptions in government, academia, publishing, health care, and the arts. It seems likely that the CBC, as Canada’s largest broadcaster, would receive even more tips than I do. Investigating every one of them would be impossible; each one requires the efforts of reporters, editors, fact checkers, and legal experts, an expenditure of resources that must be justified. </p>
<p>The CBC episode suggests that choosing which leads to pursue is now partly determined by how the investigation will benefit the reporters and the media outlet, and not necessarily by how it will benefit&mdash;or harm&mdash;the Indigenous people it concerns.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">s a contributor to the genre</span> of pretendian investigations&mdash;someone whose own career has been advanced by one such investigation&mdash;I have become increasingly uncomfortable with how these stories reinforce the idea that justice can be reached by discrediting an individual’s claims rather than by dismantling the systems and cultural mechanisms that reward and reinforce such deceptions at scale. In the wake of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, many institutions sought to “indigenize,” doing so by rewarding self-identified Indigenous people with jobs, grants, awards, honours, and titles. This was often done on the basis of how well those individuals performed to expectations of what an Indigenous person should be, or who offered a non-threatening version of Indigeneity that served the interests of the institution. In short: organizations and institutions incentivized identity fraud. And until they rectify their mistakes and change their processes, the frauds will continue, and investigations&mdash;picking off high-profile examples one by one without addressing the root of the problem&mdash;can only be seen as journalism closer to the true crime or sensational scam genre rather than journalism that advances reconciliation. </p>
<p>The CBC’s investigation has caused tremendous pain to many Indigenous people, particularly to Sainte-Marie’s Piapot family, who have reportedly suffered harassment since the investigation. More broadly, it’s possible for some viewers to come away with a renewed belief that Indigenous people who have experienced trauma are exaggerating or outright lying, or that they are trading on a sad story for profit. It is the responsibility of journalists who cover these stories to ensure they are contextualized so that audiences are not just scandalized but informed. We are obligated to go beyond just “public interest,” as the CBC’s Fenlon underscored in his editor’s blog, to consider <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> we conduct these investigations and whether they are leading us to a place of clarity and understanding&mdash;or if they are entertainment meant to titillate and scandalize audiences, told by reporters with no stake in the fallout and no obligation to those impacted by the revelations. </p>
<p>It can be true that Buffy Sainte-Marie is part of the Indigenous community by adoption and not by blood; in fact, recognizing Indigenous sovereignty requires us to learn to distinguish between the two. This does not make her history irrelevant, nor does it negate the painful likelihood that she cultivated a decades-long deception, appropriating a very real and widespread experience of Indigenous trauma to burnish her claims. Instead, the two truths must sit uncomfortably beside each other. We cannot use her impact and relationships to excuse her lies, nor can we say that those lies negate her citizenship in Piapot.  </p>
<p>Kim TallBear, a Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate scholar who has investigated pretendians, told the CBC, “This one should make it obvious that we have a real problem we have to address and that organizations and institutions and governments need to get on board and figure out how to stop this problem.” Should the histories of adoptees be scrutinized even when they are accepted by a First Nation? Should recognition by a First Nation be viewed as suspect or insufficient? Neither is a path to greater justice, and neither upholds the rights of Indigenous people. </p>
<p>Some have asked: Why pretend to be Indigenous in the 1960s, when it was still stigmatized? Sainte-Marie’s fame is its own answer: she could wear the identity lightly and freely because she was unburdened by the intergenerational pain that so often accompanies it; she did not have to overcome the lifetime of discrimination or internal obstacles that other talented young Indigenous women would have faced. It’s painful to think that Sainte-Marie, in casting about for a credible backstory as an Indigenous person, seized on the trauma of adoption as a defining aspect. </p>
<p>Membership in an Indigenous community is not meant to be used as a shield from criticism, something to hide behind or deflect criticism with. Sainte-Marie has the opportunity now to set the record straight and say honestly that she is a member of her Cree community by adoption, and by meeting that obligation, she could dismantle the idea that Indigenous identity is forged in a crucible of blood and trauma rather than belonging and power. “I think people are responding as though the whole thing was a lie,” said Cree author Michelle Good on the <em>Commotion</em> podcast. “[But] when you stood in a concert with Buffy going wild, with her amazing music and her amazing presentation, your feeling was real. That was <em>real</em>. You don’t have to give up that feeling that you had, you don’t have to give up your admiration for the talent, and for the encouragement that she gave Indigenous people.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;Buffy has some work to do in terms of sorting this all out, but we don’t.” </p>
<p>Whether we like it or not, at least part of the truth has been revealed. It’s up to Indigenous people to make sense of it, to reconcile our pain and disbelief, and to figure out how to move forward with care and respect for one another’s responses to these revelations. That’s our burden, one that the CBC, or any major news outlet, does not have to carry. They are free to move on to the next story. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/pretendian-investigations/">What’s the Point of “Pretendian” Investigations?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

They have a well-established routine. If there’s time, they go to their secure room. If not, they await impact, hoping the rockets won’t hit their homes. </p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/10/11/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-hamas-attack-timeline.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">morning of October 7</a>, close friends of mine were holed up in their secure room. While they normally wait for the rockets to land before resuming their routines, this time they heard a terrifyingly unfamiliar sound: militants, who they rightly assumed were Hamas, roaming outside their front door. While the Israeli military and police would take many hours to arrive, their own kibbutz volunteer readiness force engaged the militants in a firefight. Soon, the two Hamas operatives lay dead on the sidewalk in front of their house, in the exact spot where I have stood many times. My friends narrowly escaped being murdered, burned alive, or taken hostage. Another friend of mine, <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/10014375/vivian-silver-israel-attack/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Canadian-Israeli peace activist Vivian Silver</a>, who lives in nearby Kibbutz Be’eri, wasn’t so lucky. Abducted by Hamas operatives, Vivian now sits in captivity in Gaza along with over 240 other hostages, a number that includes at least thirty children. As of this writing, Hamas has released four hostages; another one, a soldier, was rescued. </p>

<p>Watching the news unfold, of over 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians, being gunned down that day, Jews worldwide experienced intergenerational Holocaust trauma, the unconscious terror always lurking in our DNA. Our worst nightmare is intruders coming into our house and seeking to kill or kidnap us as we place our bodies between murderers and our own children. October 7 was the bloodiest day for Jews since the Nazis concluded their extermination campaign.</p>
<p>And now, predictably, Israel has responded with massive use of force in Gaza, promising to root out Hamas. It has cut off the supply of food, water, fuel, and electricity to the region, with nearly two weeks passing before convoys of humanitarian trucks were finally able to enter through the Rafah crossing. From the outset, we saw statements from <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/israel/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Israel</a>’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, calling for revenge. Given what Israelis endured that day, collective rage is understandable. But vengeance is a terrible guide for military action.</p>
<p>The scale of Israeli bombing shows a disregard for key principles of international humanitarian law. Many Palestinians in Gaza do not support Hamas. And even if they did, all care must be taken to protect civilians. This is called the principle of distinction&mdash;distinguishing non-combatants from combatants. Second, the force used must not exceed what is needed to achieve the given military objective. Collective punishment must be avoided at all costs. As of this writing, over 10,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed&mdash;a figure that includes a staggering 4,000 children&mdash;with the rest of Gaza’s 2.1 million people facing a humanitarian disaster of epic proportions.</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smallcaps">here does</span> this leave Canada? We must continue to operate on two levels: one globally and the other locally. We must demand an immediate ceasefire and the provision of humanitarian relief while we continue to call for the release of hostages by Hamas. Canada has <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-israel-hamas-war-updates-trucks-carrying-aid-arrive-in-gaza/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pledged</a> $50 million in humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza, on top of the $10 million Prime Minister <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/justin-trudeau/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Justin Trudeau</a> earmarked initially. In international meetings in the region, foreign affairs minister Mélanie Joly has expressed concern about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza since Israel demanded that over 1 million Palestinians flee from the northern to the southern half of the Gaza Strip. With a population density nearly twice that of Toronto, such forced displacement is a cruel and unreasonable demand. And while more than hundreds of thousands of Palestinians did obey Israel’s call, Israeli military keeps targeting the very areas civilians are told to go to.</p>
<p>Why don’t Palestinians just try to leave Gaza altogether? Palestinians have no airport. Their sea access is curtailed by Israel. There are two ground exits: one into Israel, the other into Egypt. Egypt is, and always has been, highly restrictive about who it admits from Gaza. The northern part of Egypt, the Sinai Desert, has insufficient infrastructure to support a Palestinian refugee population. And fearing they wouldn’t be allowed back, Palestinians are wary of leaving en masse. They fear a second round of ethnic cleansing: in 1948, pre-state forces drove 750,000 Palestinians from their homes. When the Arab-Israeli war ended in 1949, Palestinians, now refugees, were never granted return, nor were they compensated for their properties. Anything they left behind&mdash;land, houses, personal effects&mdash;was appropriated or destroyed by the new state of Israel. Already, an internal document from the Israeli intelligence ministry reveals that a full ethnic cleansing plan, which would entail transferring the Palestinian population from Gaza into Egypt, has been floated in detail.</p>
<p>How should we talk with one another about these issues amidst such anger, moral outrage, and fear? We must ensure that our conversations, our rallies, our vigils, and our public statements are values based. Members of these communities are rightly scared of hatred intensifying in our midst. Already, the horrific news from south of the border, that a six-year-old Muslim boy <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67119183.amp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was murdered</a> in Illinois in an apparent hate crime by a white (and non-Jewish, non-Muslim) American, is chilling. In cities and campuses across Canada, Jewish-Palestinian tensions are at an all-time high. </p>
<p>We must stand for dignity, freedom, and the protection of civilians from harm. Statements like those out of some unions praising the Hamas massacre of October 7 have no place here. Accordingly, we must stand with Israeli civilians who were just trying to go about their lives. We must stand with Palestinian civilians in the West Bank, scores of whom have been shot dead by Israelis since last month’s war began, and all of whom have suffered for decades under Israel’s brutal military occupation and savage attacks by Israeli settlers. And it is urgent that we stand with Palestinian civilians in Gaza, who are facing a humanitarian disaster and whose daily conditions, even before October 7, have been nearly unlivable, some of it the fault of their own authoritarian leaders and much of it the responsibility of Israel’s decades-long blockade. </p>
<p>And when this immediate crisis ebbs, we must urge our government to take the kind of leadership role it once had, many years ago, when it shepherded the multilateral working group on Palestinian refugees. Other such groups focused on water, the environment, economic development, and security. These working groups emerged out of the 1991 Israeli-Arab peace talks <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1989-1992/madrid-conference" rel="noopener" target="_blank">at Madrid</a>&mdash;hosted by the US and Russia just as the Cold War had ended&mdash;where Palestinians were forced to participate only in the context of a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. While well intentioned, and despite Canada’s reputation as a Middle East peacekeeper starting in the 1950s, giving hope that it could help parties find common ground, the talks faltered. Among other things, Palestinians were concerned with return, restitution, and compensation for properties lost. Israel preferred to keep the discussion focused on resettling the refugees in their new host countries around the region. The rest of the working groups dissolved by the mid-1990s as well.</p>
<p>Sadly, today there are no peace talks of any kind to support. The last round collapsed in 2014. Since then, Palestinians have felt betrayed by Israel’s continued West Bank settlement building, tacit support for settler violence, and de facto moves to annex parts of the territory. Israelis have felt hemmed in by episodes of violent Palestinian resistance&mdash;and even by the kind of non-violent protest embodied in the global BDS movement, which calls for boycott, divestments, and sanctions against Israel. Israeli officials repeatedly state that, in the Palestinians, they have “no partner.”</p>
<p>It feels almost bizarrely nostalgic to invoke the multilateral talks, when Canada played a leadership role, now. But Canada’s values have not changed since then. And we must lead where we can. Canada is understandably concerned with getting its own citizens out of harm’s way, including at least 14,000 Canadians in Lebanon, where another front threatens to open between Israel and Hezbollah. Canada has arranged flights for its citizens there, though media reports suggest that there are logistical challenges even with a working airport. Getting Canadian citizens out of Gaza has proven more difficult. The only possible exit, the one between Gaza and Egypt, remains largely sealed.</p>
<p>Farther north, Israel has evacuated twenty-eight communities, bringing the total number of displaced Israelis to 200,000. Across Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, Hezbollah and the Israel Defence Forces have been trading fire. Neither side has an incentive to see a repeat of the 2006 Israel&ndash;Hezbollah War in Lebanon, but observers are on high alert.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smallcaps">eyond that</span>, Canada must adhere to its stated policy of supporting Palestinian self-determination through a territorially contiguous state. This also means criticizing Israel’s collective punishment of Palestinians in Gaza as well as its human rights violations in the West Bank as the occupation grinds on. And while the two-state solution as the goal has been the international consensus for decades within the international community, Canadian diplomats may wish to explore related, but perhaps more creative, options like <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-state-plus-framework-a-confederal-solution-for-israel-palestine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confederal approaches</a>. These, as embodied in groups like A Land for All, would entail two states but with an important difference from the conventional two-state solution. Citizenship and residency would be decoupled. And there would be freedom of residency and movement for all. Thus, West Bank settlements, long seen as an insurmountable impediment to a two-state solution, could stay in what would become a Palestinian state; the Israeli citizens living there would, of course, have to obey local laws, just as would the Palestinian refugees who would finally be allowed to return to live in their towns inside Israel, if they wished. </p>
<p>The task of finding a solution has never been more challenging, but neither has it been more urgent. The one friend I have in Gaza, an Arabic teacher I’ve been meeting with weekly, sometimes more often, for over a year, is named Sara. When she is able to charge her phone with the limited electricity there, we’ve been able to communicate on WhatsApp. She is pregnant. She is understandably afraid to eat spoiled food that could be rotten. And she has seen death all around her. She tells me she does not know whether she will survive. </p>The post <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/israel-palestine-canada-must-lead-where-it-can/">Israel–Palestine: Canada Must Lead Where It Can</a> first appeared on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca">The Walrus</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p>It is the one letter whose name changes at the forty-ninth parallel. Even now, I can only read it as “Zed” with effort. You’ve read it too, and its sound in your mind tells you something important about who and where you are.</p>
<p>Z is a small hook on which I have hung an excessive weight of fear and hope. Z means that I am here. On most days, being in Canada does not mean much beyond the ordinary, but there are days when I cannot read or hear or say the letter Z without a sense of stupid, unearned relief. One was the day I watched, on my laptop in Toronto, rioters sack the Capitol. It was the first full pandemic winter: I remember the makeshift home office in our basement, the hum of the space heater, the snow melting on the doormat, the Capitol office where I worked in my twenties suddenly on the screen, with friends and old co-workers inside (mercifully unhurt, it turned out). That night, the same as every night, I sang my daughters the ABC song before bed: “.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;W, X, Y, and Zed.”</p>

<p>My family is American and has been for generations. I come from nineteenth-century Jewish immigrants on both sides. America’s democratic decline, or erosion, or backsliding&mdash;grave and heavy metaphors all&mdash;should not be my concern in anything other than the bloodless, calculative sense of the way it impinges on my new home. But countries don’t let us off that easily. Hence the claustrophobic sense that, even here, I am still there, in a violent place with more violence to come. Hence my interest in the letter Z.</p>
<p>I would like to believe that I have landed elsewhere, a place with a more usable past and a more open future. I don’t know when or if I’ll begin to think of myself as Canadian. I can’t predict how my three young daughters will come to think of themselves. But I know that a man with children, as the saying goes, has given hostages to fortune. I know that they are hostages to the fortune of <em>this</em> place. And so my feelings for this place, with all of the compounded love and worry and frustration, are bound up with the love and worry and frustration of a parent&mdash;in a way that the feelings grow more entangled the deeper my children’s roots here grow, in a way that I couldn’t begin to disentangle them if I tried.</p>

<p>In the United States, I played a bit role in American politics, as a speechwriter in the House and Senate, and then I went back to school to earn my PhD. Now I teach political theory in Toronto. When I try to explain what brought me here, I first look for one of the big capitalized nouns that dotted the immigration stories I learned growing up: Freedom, Religion, Opportunity. But in the space where the great abstract noun is supposed to be, I find only a human-sized tangle of motives. </p>
<p>There is the prosaic: a job. There is the prudential: excellent public schools, fewer guns, paid parental leave, a future in which my children are at least marginally less likely to be crushed under student debt or health care bills. And there are the motives I struggle to find words for even now&mdash;the clench in my stomach when I read the news from home, the foolish relief centred arbitrarily on the letter Z.  </p>
<p>Who are Canadians to me? “They” or “we”? Neither feels right. To tell Canadians what I believe <em>they</em> are and what I think <em>they</em> should do feels aloof and arrogant. More importantly, it feels false to our community of neighbours and friends here, people I certainly imagine sharing the first-person plural with me. And yet <em>we</em> still feels arrogant in its own right. Who am I, trailing my Americanness behind me, to tell Canadians who <em>we</em> are?</p>
<p>Fully aware that there is no satisfactory solution, I am making an arbitrary choice: <em>we</em>. Call it the aspirational <em>we</em>. The aspiration is simply this: that at some indefinite point in the future, it will come to be accurate.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smallcaps">f there is one theme</span> in the literature of Canadian nationalism, it is the all-pervasive fear of being reduced to a cartographical fiction&mdash;or perhaps the fear that Canadians already are and simply, mortifyingly, haven’t noticed yet.</p>
<p>Historically, the Canadian fear of absorption has been compounded by the self-deprecating sense that our differences from America are trivial, that nothing much is in danger of being absorbed after all. As Northrop Frye put it: “What is resented in Canada about annexation to the United States is not annexation itself, but the feeling that Canada would disappear into a larger entity without having anything of any real distinctiveness to contribute to that entity.”</p>
<p>But that claim, if it ever was true, is simply not true anymore. Canadians of an older generation could look south and see a more or less equally democratic neighbour&mdash;louder and richer but not enormously distinct from English Canada. Canadians of this generation look south and see something that demands our fear. And this just at the moment we have lost the words for our differences.</p>
<p>Set aside the many millions of Americans who celebrate what their country is becoming; among the rest, over the past decade, I’ve observed a diversity of personalized breaking points that I can only describe as kaleidoscopic. A photo of an immigrant boy behind chain link, draped in a foil blanket. Police in riot gear smashing the head of an elderly protester onto concrete in upstate New York. The president, in a cloud of teargas, brandishing the Bible like a weapon. Uvalde, or El Paso, or Parkland, or Tree of Life, or Pulse nightclub, or Charleston, or Sandy Hook.</p>
<p>I don’t know how January 6 will be remembered, how my children will learn it in school one day: as a failure, a blip, the high-water mark of an authoritarian movement that Americans decisively rejected, beginning with the elections two years later, or as a trial run, a proof of concept, a beginning rather than an ending. But I also don’t know if I’ll ever see another American presidential election that both parties accept as legitimate. I do know that a majority of Republican representatives voted to overturn the 2020 presidential election. I know that, even in the midst of a disappointing midterm for their party, some 200 election-denying Republicans were elected to federal office. I know that nineteen states responded to the election of a Democratic president by rolling back voting rights. I know that politicians have long been in the practice of selecting their own voters for House elections, that the Supreme Court shows no inclination to stop them, and that the algorithms helping them draw their districts have never been more sophisticated. I know that the Senate is the institutional expression of white, rural, minority rule, and that this is fine, because America is a republic, not a democracy. I know what <em>autogolpe</em> means now. I suspect that American English is done being a net importer of authoritarian terms. </p>
<p>In June 2020, a reporter asked Justin Trudeau about Donald Trump’s threat to crush protesters with military force. Nothing sums up the Canadian response to all of these developments better than Trudeau’s famous twenty-one seconds of silence. Say what you will about him, but in that moment, he spoke authentically for his people: our terror at the mere thought of antagonizing the big neighbour, our self-congratulatory sense that truly bad things happen elsewhere, leavened by a pro forma allowance that, of course, we aren’t perfect (“It’s time for us as Canadians to recognize that we too have our challenges”).</p>
<p>Twenty months later, our capital was occupied, our crossings to America cut off, our Emergencies Act invoked for the first time. We too have our challenges.</p>
<p>It was commonly treated as a laugh line that one of the leaders of the Ottawa truck blockade, appearing in court, invoked his First Amendment rights. (“First Amendment?” asked the judge. “What’s that?”) But what a perfect illustration of the fact that the far-right movements in Canada and America are continuous with one another, that the forces that produced Trumpism in America are on the move here too: the same political vocabulary, the same collective imagination, the same conspiracy theories, the same funding sources. The same difficulty, among the political class in both countries, in imagining a constructive response to those forces beyond the sledgehammer of law enforcement.</p>
<p>What I heard in those twenty-one seconds of silence was the most eloquent expression possible of the great Canadian exemption: the idea that the forces upending democracies around the world somehow don’t reach this far north. What I saw in the Ottawa blockade&mdash;our own, slow-motion January 6&mdash;was its convincing refutation. Our exemption has rarely seemed less secure.</p>
<p>If that is true, then asserting our difference&mdash;asserting it in a way that shapes our culture, our diplomacy, our domestic politics, our sense of ourselves&mdash;matters in this generation in a way that it has rarely mattered before. Because there <em>is</em> a difference, beginning with this basic fact that has yet to penetrate our politics: <em>our neighbour is an eroding democracy</em>. </p>
<p>Canadian politics needs to start from that reality, because it is the political fact with the farthest-reaching consequences for Canadian life. Canada is not exempt from the polarization, the authoritarianism, and the conspiracizing that have put the future of American democracy into doubt. But Canada is different. If those forces are not so advanced here, it is not because Canada is congenitally behind the times. It is because our democracy can draw on a set of resources that are distinctly of this place. With that in mind, Canadian distinctiveness is not a vanity object: it is the essential safeguard of Canadian democracy.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">R</span><span class="smallcaps">eading reports</span> of the first shots of the American Civil War, the Ontario Reform leader George Brown said simply: “We are glad we are not them.” Our future depends on our ability to say something similar, and to mean it; to say it explicitly, not silently; to say it openly enough that it becomes an organizing principle of our national life, not simply a comforting excuse for our failures. Our future depends on our mental independence from America. We can’t effectively protect what sets us apart&mdash;from our own institutions like parliamentary government to a remarkable openness to immigration&mdash;without understanding what makes them our own. We can’t aspire to anything meaningfully better until we are secure in our difference, until we stop seeing ourselves through American eyes.</p>
<p>In saying that, I do not mean to imply that Canada is some sort of privileged child of history or that all this is a matter of our purity and their contamination. If anything, for much of our history, things have been the other way around. What I have to offer is not some sort of transcendent truth about national characters but rather a set of strategies adapted to the demands of this historical moment, taken in a broad sense&mdash;that is, the sense that does not expect the problem to be buried with Trump, the sense that does not expect the Canadian exemption to last in the absence of determined and creative action to lock it in place.</p>
<p>An eroding democracy is a threat to democracy in its neighbours. Think of the ways in which far-right and nativist forces collaborate across borders. Think of Tucker Carlson filming from Viktor Orbán’s Hungary, or Steve Bannon’s post-Trump career as a European fascist, or the cheers for Nigel Farage at a convention for American conservatives, or the pipeline of funding that connects Vladimir Putin and Marine Le Pen, or the 2023 re-enactment of the Capitol riot, planned from Orlando and staged in Brasília. Globally, as measured by Freedom House, those forces have contributed to sixteen consecutive years of democratic erosion. Such forces bear on Canada in many ways, from alleged Chinese interference in federal elections to real estate prices bid up by foreign oligarchs in Vancouver or Toronto. But, by virtue of proximity and power, the most important conduits of democratic instability run due south.</p>
<p>Those conduits are symbolized by the roughly 44 percent of funding for the Ottawa blockade that originated in the United States, by its round-the-clock promotion on Fox News and other right-wing media, and by its celebration in the American far-right and anti-vax movements. In the words of a 2022 report issued by Canadian intelligence experts, including high-level advisers to both the Harper and Trudeau governments, “the United States is and will remain our closest ally, but it could also become a source of threat and instability.” A little less cautiously, we might say that it already has. As one of the report’s authors put it, “there are serious risks of democratic backsliding in the U.S., and at this point, that is not a theoretical risk. So all of that is a threat to our sovereignty, to our security, and in some cases, to our democratic institutions.”</p>
<p>On their own, those facts are worrisome enough; in context, they are more so. The history of this hemisphere is a history of a hegemon willing and able to build up and pull down neighbouring governments&mdash;a history from which Canada has by no means been exempt. It is hard to imagine a democratically eroded America being <em>more</em> friendly to Canadian democracy, a democracy that would begin to look like a standing rebuke.</p>
<p>More abstractly, America’s power and prestige have always lent it a sort of political gravity. Powerful states, whatever their form of government, prompt envy and emulation. It seems as if they make the history the rest of us merely watch, as if they come from slightly in the future. They set the bounds of common sense within which the rest of us operate. Maybe an authoritarian America would provoke only revulsion here&mdash;I’m sure it would in many of us. But authoritarianism wouldn’t have a constituency if it didn’t have its own glamour and appeal. Slowly and steadily, without any of us explicitly acknowledging its influence and many of us loudly disclaiming it, it would shape our sense of what is possible here&mdash;of what is permissible here. </p>
<p>Resisting that process begins by looking the facts in the eye: the historical situation in which Canadians find themselves is fundamentally changed. Once, our connections to America were the many channels through which democratic ideas and practices entered our country; today, the situation is closer to the opposite. A free society cannot insulate itself from such influences, nor should it want to. But it can sharpen its critical capacity to assess and filter those influences as they arrive.</p>
<p>Our difference is not a luxury good, something for a rich and mostly contented people to worry about in the absence of more pressing concerns. On the contrary, it is our democratic immune system. And if that is the case, then the central challenge of Canadian politics at this moment is to develop and elaborate the idea of our difference; to discover, if we can, its deep roots in our history; and to give that idea an institutional and political expression.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="smallcaps">aturated as we are</span> by American media, and used to our position as a junior power on this continent, it is all too easy to see our difference through an American lens. What we see, and internalize, is a set of trivialities: milk in bags, beavers, some peculiar spellings. Even some potentially further-reaching facts, like universal health care, stand out in isolation, almost as accidents, maybe as objects that we are fearful of somehow misplacing. The prototypical American gesture toward Canada is a pat on the head. “A really nice apartment over a meth lab,” in Robin Williams’s famous line. America’s Hat.</p>
<p>I don’t want to read too deeply into that gesture, because it’s the privilege of any empire not to take too deep an interest in its smaller, weaker neighbours. For our part, we do not need others to take us seriously. We do need to take ourselves seriously. In that regard, the problem is that the triviality we see reflected back at us is the product of someone else’s needs, not our own. Much of our trouble in imagining ourselves as meaningfully separate serves political ends we never consented to and answers questions we ourselves never asked.</p>
<p>Canadians need to think more deliberately about building (in the words of David Graeber and David Wengrow) <em>structures of refusal</em>: deliberate, systematic choices about what to accept from our neighbour and what to reject, the choices through which we define and maintain our difference. We are what we refuse. In an age of democratic decline, Canada’s democracy depends on refusal&mdash;serious, targeted, and creative.</p>
<p>In my book <em><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.ca/books/Not-Here/Rob-Goodman/9781668012437" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Not Here: Why American Democracy Is Eroding and How Canada Can Protect Itself</a></em>, I lay out four key refusals, all of which can help make an authoritarian future less likely in Canada. The refusal of the dangerous idea of one “real” Canadian people. The refusal of political charisma and founder worship. The refusal to separate democracy from economic solidarity. And the refusal to let great-power conflict abroad justify democratic erosion at home.</p>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smallcaps">t times,</span> it seems as if the visible signs of our difference are so small and so slight that I’m a fool to hang so much on them. And then the light shifts, and they become the evidence of things unseen: the long “o” in <em>process</em> and <em>tomorrow</em> and <em>sorry</em>; “washrooms”; “lineups”; waiting for the light to change at the crosswalk, without a car in sight; the late onset of summer, so joyful that it hurts. <em>Things will be different here</em>. When the news from home is particularly bad, I’m embarrassed that things so trivial should be so consoling, ashamed by the intensity with which I want to believe that things will be different here, by the fear that they will not be.</p>
<p>I’ve been singing my daughters the ABC song at bedtime their whole lives. I changed it when we moved here: “.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;W, X, Y, and Zed.” <em>Things will be different here</em>. My youngest daughter is just a few months older than this book. My middle daughter has been here since she was two months old; she came in her sleep, facing backward in a bucket car seat in a van trailing a U-Haul, and that version is the only one she knows. But my oldest daughter still remembers when I sang it to her in our tiny apartment in the States, and she knows something about the difficulty of leaving; and whenever I try to change the last letter, she reacts with outrage that anyone would violate the sanctity of the alphabet. Before I can end, she claps her hand over my mouth: “Zee, man. It’s Zee.”</p>
